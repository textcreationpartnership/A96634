            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have preſumed to Dedicate theſe my labours to you, being the Tranſlation of a moſt Worthy and Learned Author, Dr. <hi>Tho. Willis</hi> his Works, out of the <hi>Latine</hi> into our Mother Tongue, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of my Country-men: and knowing you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been a general, and generous <hi>Patriot,</hi> a lover of your Country, and of all manner of Induſtry and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, I queſtion not, but you will kindly receive this my Dedication; though not for my ſake, yet for the many admirable things that may be found in the Book it ſelf, and for the good and benefit, which this my laborious task may bring to the publick. As I doubt not of your innate Goodneſs, having already had ſome particular experience thereof, ſo I ſhall no ways fear an unkind reception: And although I launch not into the ſea of your Praiſes, as is the late cuſtom of <hi>Dedicators</hi> to do, I am perſwaded, that this my plain Epiſtle will be as kindly accepted; for I know you to be ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt a Man, as not to love to ſee all your good Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Virtues and worth, Rhetorically painted and laid open before your Eyes: for as your Worth is too well known, this way to receive any addition; ſo the praiſe thereof being needleſs, will rather cauſe you to bluſh, than be any ways pleas'd. But yet I cannot forbear to take notice to the World, that your whole Life has
<pb facs="tcp:152521:4"/>
been a true pattern of Loyalty and Religion, which in theſe troubleſome and diſtracted times, may be worthily related and mentioned, as a praiſe-worthy Example for others to imitate and follow: and that you are both a true lover of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> your King, and Country, which you have eminently ſhew'd in all your Actions, and manifeſted to the World, by your ſeveral publick Employs, in the behalf of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and of the Renowned City of <hi>London,</hi> of which you are a moſt worthy Member. And no doubt, but that it is for this your ſtedfaſtneſs in Religion, your Loyalty to your Prince, your Love to your Country, and your uprightneſs in your Dealings, that God hath ſhowered on you all manner of external Bleſſings, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you a fair Eſtate, through your own Induſtry, Wiſdom, and Prudence, a Virtuous Conſort, and a proſperous Iſſue, the fair and flouriſhing Branches of your Ancient Stock and Family: To all which outward felicities, I ſhall pray, That God may alſo indue your noble Soul with the Celeſtial and Eternal Bleſſings and treaſures of the World to come, and that you may be conſtantly happy both here and hereafter.

Entring upon this Diſquiſition, I thought I had been tyed only to the Bakers Oven, and Brewers Furnace, being condemned to the Mill, not to have proceeded beyond their limits, unleſs by chance, or with leave; but after that I had begun to look more deeply into the matter, I perceived I had gotten a far more large Province: Becauſe it plainly appeared, beſides theſe of Art, very many Works of Nature, to be not only like, but themſelves the effects of Fermentation: For when, for the ſolving of the Phoenomenas, which are met with about the ſwelling up of the mealy Maſs, and the working of Wine, and of other Liquors, I had Compoſed divers Arguments, Reaſons, and Hypotheſes, I found at length, thoſe firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Particles, by whoſe Orgaſm or Heat, thoſe vulgar preparations do Ferment, to beget the Cauſes of motions, and alterations, in whatever things they are mix'd with beſides; wherefore, I may be pardoned, if I have ſtrayed far from our propoſition, and have ſeemed to any one, to have heaped together here, too plentiful an Harveſt of Matter, becauſe I was wholly led by the ſame thrid of Ratiocination, and the moſt conjunct Affinity of things, to theſe various and diverſe Concretes. If any one ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb facs="tcp:152521:7"/>
that I proſtitute the unuſual Notions, and almoſt only heard of, in the Shops of the Chymiſts, unhandſomly among the works of ordinary people, I ſay, theſe Principles, which being brought indeed to perform the ſelf moving motions of Natural things, alſo more eaſily to repreſent them to the vulgar capacity, and lay them not only before their Eyes, but even into their very Hands; what of theſe kind of ſubſtances, I call Particles, men tho rude and unskilful, may perceive even by the help of their ſenſes to be in the things: beſides the names of Sulphur, Salt, and Spirit, and the reſt, are more familiarly known, than Matter, and Form, or the four Principles of the <hi>Peripateticks.</hi> As to our method, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Philoſophizing, no man can blame me, if I ſhould not here deſcribe all things according to Rule, and Analytick Patterns; becauſe in this Work, it chances for me to wander, without a Guide, or Companion, in ſolitary places, and as it were in a ſolitude trodden by no footſteps, where I not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make a Journey, but my way alſo: therefore, when ever I deviate, I cannot be ſaid to err, among right Judges of our endeavours, who have no Path in which I ſhould Walk, nor could find a Track, which I might fear to miſs.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Principles of Natural things.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is nothing more rarely to be met with, in the Vulgar Philoſophy, where Natural things are unfolded, with the vain figments of Forms and Qualities, than the word <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation:</hi> but among the more ſound (eſpecially of later years) who reſpect the Matter and Motion chiefly in Bodies, nothing is almoſt more uſual. But Fermentation hath its name from Ferveſcency, as Ferment from Ferviment or grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot. The word is well known in making of Bread, and in the purgings of new Wine, Beer, and other potable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors: thence it is alſo applyed to other things, which are wont to ſwell or grow turgid, after the ſame manner: that at length it ſignifies, whatſoever Effervency or Turgency, that is raiſed up in a Natural Body, by particles of that Body variouſly agitated.</p>
                     <p>Bodies of a divers Conſiſtency and Habitude, are apt to a Fermenting, <hi>viz.</hi> either Thin or Thick, Liquid or Solid, Animate or Inanimate, Natural or Artificial; in all which is found an Heterogeneity of parts or particles, to wit, there are in them ſome ſubſtances light, and always endeavouring to fly away: and alſo there are others thick, earthy, and more fix'd, which intangle the ſubtil Particles, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein them in their Embraces, whilſt they endeavour to fly away; from the ſtrivings, and wreſtlings of theſe two twins, in one Womb, the motion of Fermentation chiefly proceeds; but on the contrary, what things do not Ferment, for the moſt part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of like Particles, and are of the ſame Figure and Conformation, which indeed conſociat among themſelves, without any Tumult or Turgeſcency, lye quiet, and enjoy a deep peace. If Muſt, or new Wine, or new Ale or Beer, be cloſely Bottl'd up, or put into Veſſels of ſmall vent, they will grow ſo very hot, that often the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are in danger of breaking. But if the ſame Liquors, being Diſtilled by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and then what is ſeperated ſhut up, from thence no motion or heat will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Wherefore, Diſtilled Waters, hot Spirits, Oyls, fixed Salts of Herbs, and very many other more ſimple preparations of the Chymiſts, remain a long while
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152521:9"/>
without any alteration or Fermentation, Perhaps ſome of the Particles do evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but the reſt do not tumultuate. In the mean time the juice and blood of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables or Animals, as alſo all Liquors Concreted, and compounded of many things, quickly Ferment, and from thence enter into divers turns of changes. The Spirit of Wine being cloſely ſhut up in a Phial ſhews no ſign of growing hot, but if but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Oyl of Turpentine be added to this Spirit, the Particles of the Liquor will ſo leap forth, that I have ſeen it break a Glaſs Hermetically Sealed. All Diſtilled Waters of Herbs, ſo they be kept ſimply in a Glaſs, will remain incorrupt a long time, but if you add to the ſame Sugar or Syrrup, it preſently grows ſoure and is corrupted: Wherefore, that the Fermentation of Bodies may be rightly unfolded, we muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what thoſe Particles or Subſtances are, and of what Nature of which mixt things are Compounded, and from whoſe being put together, and mutual ſtrivings, motions for the moſt part naturally proceed.</p>
                     <p>Altho there be many and divers Opinions of Philoſophers concerning the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Natural things, yet there are three chiefly deſerve our Aſſent, and Faith, before the reſt. That famous fourfold Chariot of the Peripateticks obtains the chief place, which emulous of the four wheel'd Coach of the Sun, is hurried by a quick paſſage, through the fictitious Heaven of the firſt Matter, and meaſures that vaſt and empty thing, with a perpetual reciprocation. For they ſay, all things are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted out of Water, Air, Fire, and Earth; and that out of the divers tranſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe, Generation and Corruption, as alſo the changes of all alterations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, do ariſe. In the ſecond place, and next, ſtands the Opinion of <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> which lately alſo hath been revived in our Age, this affirms all Natural effects to depend upon the Conflux of Atoms diverſly figured, ſo that in all Bodies, there be Particles Round, Sharp, Fourſquare, Cylindrical, Chequer'd or Streaked, or of ſome other Figure; and from the divers changes of theſe, the Subject is of this or that Figure, Work, or Efficacy. The third Opinion of the Origination of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Things, is introduced by Chymiſtry, which, when by an Analyſis made by Fire, it reſolves all Bodies into Particles of Spirit, Sulphur, Salt, Water, and Earth, affirms by the beſt right, that the ſame do conſiſt of theſe. Becauſe this Hypotheſis determinates Bodies into ſenſible parts, and cutts open things as it were to the life, it pleaſes us before the reſt.</p>
                     <p>As to the four Elements, and firſt Qualities from thence deduced, I muſt confeſs that this Opinion doth ſomthing help for the unfolding the Phaenomena of Nature, but after ſo dark a manner, and without any peculiar reſpect to the more ſecret receſſes of Nature, it ſalves the appearances of things, that 'tis almoſt the ſame thing, to ſay an Houſe conſiſts of Wood and Stone, as a Body of four Elements. The other Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which is only a piece of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Philoſophy, foraſmuch as it undertakes Mechanically the unfolding of things, and accommodates Nature with Working Tools, as it were in the hand of an Artificer, and without running to Occult Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Sympathy, and other refuges of ignorance, doth happily and very ingeniouſly diſintangle ſome difficult Knots of the Sciences, and dark Riddles, certainly it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no light praiſe: but becauſe it rather ſuppoſes, than demonſtrates its Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and teaches of what Figure thoſe Elements of Bodies may be, not what they have been, and alſo induces Notions extremly ſubtil, and remote from the ſenſe, and which do not ſufficiently Quadrate with the Phaenomena of Nature, when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to particulars, it pleaſes me to give my ſentence for the third Opinion before-mentioned, which is of the Chymiſts, and chiefly to inſiſt upon this in the following Tract, to wit, affirming all Bodies to conſiſt of Spirit, Sulphur, Salt, Water, and Earth, and from the diverſe motion, and proportion of theſe, in mixt things, the beginnings and endings of things, and chiefly the reaſons, and varieties of Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are to be ſought. If any one ſhall object, That the Atomical, and our Spagyric Principles, are altogether ſubordinate, to wit, that theſe, tho at the laſt ſenſible, are reſolved into thoſe, only to be ſignified by Conception; I ſhall not much gainſay him, ſo it ſhews that thoſe Conceptions are real. I being dul and purblind, leave the more accurate to quick ſights, being content to be ſo wiſe as to perform the buſineſs of the outward Senſe with Reaſon: for I profeſs, it pleaſes not me, to deviſe or dream Philoſophy. But that our Work may more rightly proceed, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to ſpeak firſt a few things of theſe kind of Principles in general, and of their Affections.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:152521:9"/>I mean by the name of Principles, not ſimple and wholly uncompounded Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but ſuch kind of Subſtances only, into which Phyſical things are reſolved, as it were into parts, laſtly ſenſible. By the inteſtine motion, and combination of theſe, Bodies are begot, and increaſe: by the mutual departure and diſſolution of theſe one from another, they are altered, and periſh. In the mean time, what Particles are gathered together in the ſubjects, or depart away from them, will appear under the form of Spirit, Sulphur, Salt, or of one of the reſt.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. SPirits are Subſtances highly ſubtil, and Aetherial Particles of a more Divine Breathing, which our Parent Nature hath hid in this Sublunary World, as it were the Inſtruments of Life and Soul, of Motion and Senſe, of every thing; whilſt they of their own Nature are always enlarged, and endeavouring to fly away, leſt they ſhould too ſoon leave their ſubjects, they are bound ſomtimes with more thick Particles, that by entring into them, and by ſubtilizing them, and variouſly unfolding them, they diſpoſe the ſubſtance to maturity, as is to be obſerved in the Vegetation, and Fermentation of Bodies; ſomtimes being reſtrained within ſome ſpaces, to wit, the Veſſels or Bowel of living Creatures, they are compelled more often to repeat the ſame meaſures of their motions for the performing the works of Life, Senſe and Motion. From the motion of theſe proceed the animation of Bodies, the growth of Plants, and the ripening of Fruits, Liquors, and other prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; they determinate the Form and Figure of every thing, prefixed as it were by Divine deſignation: they conſerve the bonds of the mixture by their preſence; and open them, by their departure, at their pleaſure: they bridle the irregularities of Sulphur and Salt. The perfection and ſtate of every thing conſiſts in the plenty and exaltation of Spirits, and the fall and declination, in their want and defect.</p>
                     <p>As to the Subjects in which the Spirits are: Minerals becauſe they are of a more fixed nature, wanting Motion and Vegetation, are almoſt without Spirits, or at leaſt are contented with a few. For the birth and growth of Vegetables, they are required in a more moderate quantity. In the Conſtitution of a living Creature, where there is greater Uſe of Spirits, for Senſe and Motion, a far more plentiful quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity is found. In the works of Art, and chiefly in thoſe which aſcend to perfection, by Digeſtion and Fermentation, there are found to be a ſufficiently great proportion of Spirits: but in all ſubjects whatſoever, whilſt the immerſed Spirits are mingled with the other Principles, their condition or ſtate comes under a threefold conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for they are either depreſſed and ſcattered, and ſo involved with more thick Particles, that they are very little ſeen, or ſhew forth their powers, as in things undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, crude and unripe, may be perceived, in which the Spirits can hardly extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themſelves into motion, and from which they can hardly be drawn by Diſtillation. Or ſecondly, the Spirits flying forth from the thick ſubſtance of the reſt, are full of vigor, ſhake and rightly diſpoſe the more groſs Particles, ſubtilize the thick, digeſt the crude, and bring things to the ſteme or height of maturity and perfection: or laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Spirits having obtained the height of things, do luxuriate and make excurſions out of the Body: hence thoſe that remain, are by degrees leſſened of their plenty and ſtrength, until being leſs in power than the Particles of the Salts and Sulphur, they are put under their yoak, and by little and little are deſtroyed and driven away out of the Subject; on this threefold ſtate depends the beginnings or rudiments, the maturity and exaltation, and the defect and end of things.</p>
                     <p>It is obſerved, when the Spiritous Latex is drawn forth of any Liquor by Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the vapor or ſteam is not elevated into dew, that is, comes together in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle drops or dew, every where poured forth, as it is wont to do in watery things; but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152521:10"/>
it is divided into ſtreaks, and many little rivulets, and renders the Alembic mark'd in every part, with ſtraight lines, only not meridional, leading from the Centre of the top, to the brim of the Circumference. The cauſe of which ſeems to be this, to wit, ſince that the ſpirituous ſubſtance is very ſubtil, it is not eaſily Collected into Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; neither is it fixed every where about the ſides of the Veſſel, in its aſcent, as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery Liquors; but always ſtretches <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> but there the ſpirituous breath, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained as it were in a punct, and being brought backward, it begins to gather into dew: wherefore, from that top, as it were the Fountain, the Spirits flowing forth on every ſide by ſtreams, deſcend in ſtreaks towards the mouth or brim of the Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic. And when thoſe lines wholly diſappear, it is a ſign, that the ſpirituous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is quite ſtill'd forth, and that the watery breath only aſcends.</p>
                     <p n="2">2, Sulphur is a Principle of a little thicker conſiſtency than Spirit, after that, the moſt active: for when the Spirits firſt break forth from the looſned ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>y of taſtes. In the Boſom of this the Spirits immediately, in which as in a Copula, they are united, by the more hard embraces of the reſt. The ſubſtance of Sulphur, though leſs ſubtil, is yet of more firceneſs and unrulineſs than the Spirits are, for this unleſs it be reſtrained, by the embrace of the others, as it were in bonds, and its Particles be detained one from another by the interjection or coming between of the reſt, not only leaves the ſubject, but deſtroys it ſelf, with too impetuous an eruption. Indeed the little bodies of this being gently moved, do cauſe digeſtion, and maturation, ſweetneſs, and many perfective qualities in things: being a little more ſtrongly moved, they induce heat, and an exceſs of qualities, inordinations, and chiefly a ſtinking favour: but being more impetuouſly moved or ſtirred up, they bring in the diſſolution of Bodies, yea a flame and Burning.</p>
                     <p>The ſubſtance of Sulphur is never ſeen ſincere, yea it conſiſts not of it ſelf from others, but vaniſhes away into Air: its Particles being concreted and chained together, with Salt and Earth, are fixed as it were immoveable, as is ſeen in Metals and ſome Stones: or being Diluted with Spirit and Water, and temper'd together with the reſt, exiſt in motion, by which means (as was before ſaid of Spirit) they are in a threefold ſtate, within the ſubſtance of the mixture: for either firſt of all its little bodies being involved with Salt and Earth, or too much drenched with a watery hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, are obſcured, ſo that they exerciſe but little of virtue, from whence the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid and cold temper of things exiſts, their qualities are Obtuſe, Dull, and of ſmall virtue or force, and the Bodies leſs apt to be inflamed, as is diſcerned in unripe Fruit, raw Juices and green Wood. Or ſecondly, The Particles of Sulphur begin to ſhine forth with Spirit, to be more thickly heaped or rolled together, and to appear eminent above the reſt of the Principles. And ſo by its motion, they evaporate the ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moiſture, digeſt Crudities, and induce a warm temper in things, active qualities, a lively force and maturation, or ripeneſs: which kind of exaltation of Sulphur may be obſerved in Wine and Liquors long Fermented, in ripe Fruits, in the Youth and florid Conſtitution of living Creatures. Or thirdly, The Sulphureous Particles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gathered into vigor, grow too hot, looſe the bonds of mixture, and deſire to fly away; and from their diverſe manner of departure and ſeparation, the diſſolution of Bodies variouſly happens: For either they evaporate with Water and Spirit, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and without tumult, and leave their ſubjects lean and dry, which, when the Sulphur is wholy gon, fall into Aſhes: Or ſecondly, in Bodis which abound with Sulphur, when the mixture is looſned, and the Spirits begin to fly away, the remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Particles of Sulphur are wont to be very much moved, and to grow exceeding hot; and being ſhut up in a thick ſubſtance, are gathered together more nearly, (as in Dung and Hay growing hot) and conceive heat, and ſomtimes Burning: breaking forth after this manner, by heaps, and impetuouſly, they breath out a ſtinking ſmell, and bring on a rottenneſs to the ſubject. There is a third manner of eruption, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Sulphureous Particles go forth of Bodies, when they withdraw themſelves, as it were with violence, and being gathered together, break forth into fire and flame: whereby indeed becoming unbridled and untamed, they break all bars or lets, and wholly deſtroy the ſubſtance or frame of the Subject: By this means, by their own and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152521:10"/>
proper efferveſcency they procure a Burning, as when they being layed up wet, or the wheels of Carts, or Axeltree, made hot by motion doe fire, or becauſe Sulphur is inkindled by Sulphur: for its Particles being impetuouſly moved, ſhake or move all that's near them, and carry them into the like motion of Conflagration, as ſhall be more fully ſhown hereafter, when we ſhall diſcourſe concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of fire.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Salt is of a little more fixed nature, than either Spirit or Sulphur, nor ſo apt to fly away; but beſtows a Compaction and Solidity on things, and alſo weight and duration, It retards the diſſolution of Bodies, and promotes Congelations and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulations, and very much reſiſts Putrefaction, Corruption, and Inflammation; to wit, foraſmuch as it fixes the too volatile Sulphur and Spirit, and detains them in a Body: wherefore ponderous Woods, Stones, Metals, and what abound in Salt, are hardly enkindled, and remain a long while free from Corruption. Not only the duration of the individual, but alſo the propagation of the Species, depends ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much upon the Principle of Salt, becauſe the fertility of the Earth, the growth of Plants, and eſpecially the frequent faetation, and bringing forth of young, in living Creatures, takes their Original from the Saltiſh Seed: hence it is, that <hi>Venus</hi> is ſaid to ariſe from the Sea, and Luſt is called Salacity. For Salt having obtained a flux, gathers together, and ſtirs up into motion, the idle, or too much disjoyned little Bodies of Spirit or Sulphur, and excellently keeps them together with itſelf, for the producing the firſt ground-work of things.</p>
                     <p>Salt within the frame of the mixture, is either altogether fixed, when its Particles being almoſt deſtitute of Spirit and Water, but bound together with Earth, or Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, or both of them, grow into Stones, Metals, or Minerals of another kind; which fixity in Nature is imitated in making Glaſs, and Earthen Ware: or Salt is looſned from its fixedneſs, to wit, when its Particles being mixed with the other Principles, and chiefly with Spirit and Sulphur, and Diluted with Water do unfold themſelves, and being diffuſed through the mixture, do Ferment with the reſt: whilſt the little Bodies of the Salt are after this manner put into motion, there is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of them a threefold State or Condition, to wit, of Fuſion, Volatiliſation, and Fluxation.</p>
                     <p>I call the State of Fuſion, when the little Bodies of the Salt being Commixed with the reſt, begin as to their ſmalleſt parts to be diſſolved, and diffuſed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated here and there, through the whole ſubſtance of the mixture, as may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Germination of Plants, in the firſt Conceptions of living Creatures, and in the beginnings of Fermentations; hence Spring only a rude and indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted formation of things, an ingrateful ſavour, and for the moſt part bitter or biting.</p>
                     <p>From theſe firſt Rudiments of Motions, the Saline Particles aſcend by little and little, to Vigor and Volatiliſation, together with Spirit and Sulphur: to wit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they run through the whole ſubſtance of the Body, and variouſly move its matter, and diſpoſe it towards maturity. Some little Bodies ſharpen, and ſtir up into Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, others Fix, Eſtabliſh, and Congeal into a ſtony hardneſs. If there be plenty of Spirits and Sulphur, the Particles of Salt, as their handmaids, go about to unite, and aſſociate themſelves intimately with them, that they are not only ſnatched toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them, through all the receſſes of the mixture, but (the ſubject being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Diſtillation) Salt alſo aſcends in the Alembic, even as the Spirit. From the Volatiliſation of Salt, Beauty, and Fairneſs, and ſavour chiefly ſweet, happen in things, as in the florid blood of living Creatures, in ripe Fruits, as alſo in Sugar, Milk, and Hony, we know by experience.</p>
                     <p>I mean the Fluxation of Salt, when the ſaline Particles, which being firſt gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, with Earth, or Sulphur, or aſſociated with Spirit, and ſo remain ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated one from another, afterwards the bond of the mixtion being looſened, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wholy free, and unlooſened from the yoak of the reſt: for ſo they flow together, explicate themſelves through the whole frame of the ſubject, and whilſt Spirit and Sulphur for the moſt part fly away, theſe exerciſe a dominion over the remainder, and induce a ſoureneſs into the whole mixture: by reaſon of this Fluxation of Salt, Wine, Milk, Blood, and Eateable Things, at firſt grateful and ſweet, grow ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſoure when they begin to Corrupt; and for this Reaſon, all Salts whatſoever, having gotten a Flux, by a violent Diſtillation by Fire (that is, being driven from the Combination of Earth) grow ſour, than if the ſame ſour Liquor, be put upon the inſipid dead Head, the Whole laſtly becomes ſalted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:152521:11"/>Salt being deprived of the Company of the reſt, (except the Earth) becomes at laſt fixed, as is obſerved in Sea-Salt, or the incineration made of Herbs, whoſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles ſo cleave together, that they cannot be pulled aſunder by the ſtrongeſt Fire. When Vegetables are Diſtilled, ſome Saline Particles, though but few, made fit for Fuſion, aſcend with the reſt; and from thence ſome Diſtilled Waters retain a genuine ſavour of the mixture: The parts of living Creatures being expoſed to Diſtillation, yield a Volatile Salt: when Minerals, or ponderous Woods full of Salt, are brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by Chymiſtry, the Diſtilled Liquor is like to Salt that hath gotten a Flux, and is very ſour.</p>
                     <p>Spirit and Sulphur eaſily unlock the ſubſtance of the mixture, and make way for themſelves; but Salt cannot, unleſs it be ſnatched forth of doors together with the Spirit it ſelf. As Spirit and Sulphur being outwardly applyed, in diſſolving or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Body, open as it were the doors for their Companions ſhut within, ſo alſo, Salt Liquors Diſtilled, do the ſame thing. For Stygian Waters ſtrongly Corrode Metals, and are ſeen like a flame put to them, to burn and conſume the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Salt reſiſts Inflammation, for that it detains the Sulphureous Particles in its Boſom, and hinders them from breaking forth. But excepting that Sal Nitre encreaſes the burning of Sulphur, which indeed happens by accident, becauſe that Salt, as it were an Hermaphrodite, grows very turgid with Sulphureous Particles alſo, combined in the mixture; wherefore, when the Salt is melted by other fired Sulphur, the ſhut up Sulphur, breaks forth with violence, and (like a blaſt from a Bellows) ſhakes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled fire round about, and drives more impetuouſly the ſubject into a Body: In the mean time, if yout put the flame to Nitre, it will not be inkindled at all; but being put to a Sulphureous Body, it promotes its enkindling; but the other Salts, leſs turgid with Sulphureous Particles, or rather deſtitute of them, being mixed with Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, hinder its inkindling, and ſomtimes put it out.</p>
                     <p>So much for the Active Principles, which effect, as it were, the firſt ground-work of Bodies: thoſe which follow, chiefly beſtow on them Conſiſtency and Subſtance. For from hence exiſt either Liquids or Solids, Small things or Great. For Water and Earth, fill the little ſpaces that are empty, through the Combination of the reſt, with their coming between, and amplifie and enlarge the lineaments of the Body, otherwiſe too ſhort and contracted.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Water is the chiefeſt Vehicle of Spirit and Sulphur, by whoſe intervention they conſociate one with another, and with Salt; for the other Principles, being diſſolved by a watery humor, or at leaſt diluted, continue in motion, without which they grow ſtiff, as congealed things.</p>
                     <p>When Water is wanting, the active Principles meet together too ſtrictly, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually rub againſt, and conſume themſelves; and when for this reaſon, the ſuppliment of food is cut off, the Body grows withered. If humidity abounds too much, theſe Elements are eſtranged or diſſociated too much one from the other, wherefore the ſubject becomes ſluggiſh and ſlow, and of leſs efficacy, and unapt for motion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Bodies too moiſt, are lyable very much to rottenneſs and Corruption; becauſe from too much Humidity the Combination of Spirit, and Sulphur, and Salt, is too looſely effected; that they do not mutually embrace one another, nor are retained with their embracement, in the ſubject. Indeed Water abounding eaſily evaporates, and then the frame of the mixture being looſened, and the doors ſet open, Spirit and Sulphur eaſily break forth, the way being made, and leave the ſubject, as it were vapid, or made ſharp with Salt: for from hence, the infuſions of Vegitables, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions, Juices of Herbs, and all Liquid preparations, if the quantity of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be greater than the reſt of the Principles, and improportionate, quickly Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt.</p>
                     <p>Water is moſt eaſily drawn forth out of every thing by Diſtillation, for when Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Sulphur are often intangled with nets of Salt or Earth, they hardly let go-their embraces, and are not obedient but to a more intenſe heat, and often times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a previous Putrefaction. Water moſt eaſily, and often with no labour, is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of every Body. But moſt often it ſnatches in its flying away, ſome more looſe Particles of Spirit and Sulphur, and carries them with itſelf, forth of doors.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. As the interjection of Water in Liquids, ſo of Earth in Solids, fills the empty little Spaces and Vacuities, left by the other Principles. For theſe, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the active Principles from a too ſtreight embrace, whereby they ſhould rub againſt themſelves, and cleave one to another; alſo by its thickneſs, it retains
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152521:11"/>
too Volatile things: beſides, it inlarges the due ſubſtance, and magnitude in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                     <p>The more that Earth abounds in any thing, it is ſo much the leſs active, but of longer duration: hence Minerals endure a long while, then next the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Trees; in the mean time Animals, and the more ſlender Plants, are but of ſhort age.</p>
                     <p>In Diſtillations, Earth aſcends the Alembic, almoſt not at all, or but in a very little quantity: for the moſt part it is left, with a portion of Salt, for a <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> or Dead Head; therefore it is called <hi>Terra Damnata,</hi> or damned Earth: becauſe, when the other Principles are freed, the Priſon being as it were broken, this is ſtill detained: beſides, Earth being deprived of the Company of the reſt, is of no Uſe, nor capable of change, or exaltation.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the Elements or Principles of Natural things, conſidered apart, and by themſelves. It follows, that ſome of their Affinities and Conjugations be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded: becauſe theſe very ſtrictly cohere with thoſe, and very hardly or not at all are joyned with others. Out of the mutual Combination of ſome, and diſagreement of others, various Affections ariſe, the knowledg of which gives no little Light to the Doctrine of Fermentation.</p>
                     <p>There is a certain Kindred and Similitude of parts, between Spirit and Sulphur, which are agil or light, and eaſily to be diſſipated in both; wherefore, Spirit being driven forth of the Body, draws abundantly with it Sulphureous Particles, as is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in Spirituous Liquors Diſtilled out of any thing; to ſome of which if you mingle Water, the Liquor appears as it were troubled with precipitated Sulphur; but the Spirit without the Sulphur is undiſcernably mixed with the Water, which however by reaſon of is Volatility, may be alſo eaſily drawn away and ſeparated by Diſtillation.</p>
                     <p>Altho Spirit and Sulphur are Principles very reſembling, and (becauſe of a ready motion) either are inflameable, yet they are not one and the ſame, as is aſſerted by ſome: For Sulphur Copiouſly ſubſiſts in Bodies almoſt deſtitute of Spirit, to wit, in common Sulphur, Antimony, and other Minerals; in which its Particles are very fixed, and of their own nature almoſt immoveable, which is very far from the Nature of Spirits: For they abounding in any mixture, never lye idle, and always in motion, bring various alterations to the Subject where they dwell; then if they abound in ſtrength, they eaſily and without tumult carry themſelves forth of doors of their own accord. But Sulphur, altho it abound, doth not eaſily evaporate, but hath need of a ſtrong heat, or an actual fire, that may make a way for it; and laſtly, it breaks forth, not without a ſtink or burning: yea, if you endeavour to Diſtil Oyly and Fat things, although very Sulphureous, with a moderate Fire, they are wont to yield a Liquor only Wateriſh, and not inflameable; but if we provoke generous Wine, which ſwells with Spirit, by the gentle heat of a Bath, a moſt burning Water will Still forth, and apt wholly to be inflamed.</p>
                     <p>Spirit is not preſently joyned with Salt: For Sugar and Salts are ſcarcely diſſolved, by the rectified Spirit of Wine, but are after a manner aſſociated by a long dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion and circulation; as is perceived in the Volatile Salt of Animals, or Tincture drawn forth from the Salts of Herbs, or of Minerals, by the Spirit of Wine. If that Spirits excel in plenty, and virtue, they aſſume to themſelves, and Volatiliſe the Saline Particles. And therefore the Salt contained in the Juice or Blood of Animals, being aſſociated with Spirit is volatiliſed: alſo the Spirit of Wine, being Diſtilled by many Cohalations, with the fixed Salt of Herbs, renders it Volatile, and makes it paſs through the Alembic; but if the power of the Salt be greater, it tames the Spirit and fixes it. Hence the blood, being become Salt, by means of an ill dyet, becomes leſs Spirituous. Fixed Salts, and the Oyl of Vitriol fix the Spirits, grown too volatile, and unbridled; and Coagulate the Spirit of Wine it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But Sulphur is a more fit ſubject of the Spirit, by the coming between of which it eaſily is united with Salt and the other Principles; and as Spirit beſt agrees with Sulphur and Water, ſo Sulphur intimately cleaves to Earth and Salt.</p>
                     <p>As to Sulphur, beſides its affinity with Spirit, it hath a great relation with Salt it ſelf, to the volatiliſation of which it doth not a little help: wherefore in Bodies which abound with a volatile Salt, there is found plenty of Sulphur, as in Amber, Soot, Hornes and Bones, as alſo in the excrements of living Creatures; where Salt and Sulphur are in motion, and evaporate from the ſubject, a very ſtinking ſmell is ſent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152521:12"/>
forth; for Sulphur being ſharpned with Salt, pricks more ſtrongly the ſenſory, and ſtrikes it with its ſharpneſs; in the mean time, Sulphur exhaling with Spirit, both pleaſes the ſenſe, and excites a very pleaſant Smell.</p>
                     <p>Sulphur is as it were diſtracted between Spirit and Salt, and adheres at once to both parties. In the Diſtillation of Amber, Turpentine, Harts-Horn, and the like, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain leſſer part of Sulphur, being united to Spirit, firſt aſcends, and cauſes a Yellow Oyl, or clear Liquor of a grateful ſmell: the other part of Sulphur, being joyned to the Salt, is driven forth in the ſecond place, and is Diſtilled with a moſt ſtinking ſmell, in the form of a red or black Oyl: In like manner, in the Circulation of the blood, a pure and delicate portion of Sulphur, being mixed with the Spirit, ſupplies both the Animal and Vital Spirit with matter; the other more thick part, being Boyled and Roſted with Salt, is layd up in the Choledock Veſſels (or belonging to Choler) as it were a certain excrement ſeparated from the blood. As Spirit does not eaſily Cohere with Salt, ſo Sulphur does not with Water: wherefore Fat and Oyly things, as alſo Gumms and Sulphureous Refines, either ſwim upon the Water, or ſink down to its bottom. But Sulphureous things, Salt coming between, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with a Watery Liquor, as we ſee Oyls imbued with Sugar or Salt, to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in common Water, which otherwiſe would flow ſeparate.</p>
                     <p>Sulphur is not ſo tractable in Diſtillation, as Spirit, Water, or Salt: for the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of this, being very Viſcous, ſtick together among themſelves, and alſo to others, that they cannot eaſily be pulled from their embrace. Hence among Sulphureous things, there are ſome, which are not forced, but by a ſtrong and burning heat, into a ſtinking Oyl, and very empyreumatick, or ſmelling of Fire: but others, more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciouſly cleaving together, are not to be looſened by Diſtillation, but are only broken into integral parts; and ſo aſcend under the form of a dry Breath, as common Sulphur, Benzoin, Camphor, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Salt, beſides its affinity with Sulphur, is alſo moſt ſtrictly united with Earth; wherefore Stones, and the more hard Minerals, conſiſt chiefly of Salt and Earth. The Acid Spirits of Minerals, (which are only Salts reſolved into Liquor by Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) if at laſt they be poured on the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> Cohere with a ſtrict embrace to it, that there will be need of a moſt ſtrong Fire, to drive them forth again. Alſo in Glaſs, the union of Salt and Earth is ſo ſtrictly made, that it will not ſuffer a Divorce by any means. Salt alſo is moſt eaſily diſſolved in Water; and it melts of its own accord, in a moiſt Air: and theſe are as eaſily ſeparated one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>By reaſon of theſe Combinations, theſe Principles have got various Appellations, and not Congruous in their own Nature to themſelves. For Sulphur, for as much as it is Aſſociated with Spirit, is called pure and ſweet; when with Salt, impure and ſtinking, for as much as with Salt and Earth, it is called thick and Earthly; when the Spirit aſſumes to it ſelf Sulphureous Particles in a moderate quantity, it is ſeen to be ſweet; when ſaline, ſharp; when both, bitter. Salt has a diverſe diſpoſition, and is known by many names, by reaſon of its various mixture with the other Elements, and chiefly with Earth: for beſides the Titles of Fluid, Fixed, Volatile, for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is termed Marine, Aluminous, Nitrous, Vitriolick, Armoniack, or of ſome other kind. By ſome, theſe kind of Conjugations are eſteemed, but wrongfully, as ſo many divers Principles, when they are but more ſimple mixtures, by the coming together of the firſt Elements, and being looſened by Diſtillation they openly ſhew their Race, from whence they are. For all Salts whatſoever being driven into a Flux by the Fire, ſhew Liquors very near of Kin one to another, to wit, Acetous: by the like means Spirit and Sulphur are compelled to put off their Masks, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Native Species common to each.</p>
                     <p>And ſo much for the Principles of Natural Things, and of their Affections and Conjunctions. It is abundantly manifeſt, that theſe kind of Subſtances are in every Body, (beſides the Analyſes of Bodies Chymically inſtituted) alſo from the Mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and effects of Things, which happen of their own Nature. When Muſt is Ripened into Wine, is not Spirit, a Sulphureous part, alſo Salt, and Earth Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous to our Taſt and Eyes, beſides the watery Liquor? Alſo the Juice of every Plant being exalted by Digeſtion, exhibits the ſame ſincere, and as it were diſtinct: what is greater, things ſubject to the Flame, when they ſeem to be burnt, and reduced al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to nothing, they go into theſe kind of Particles; beſides the Salt remaining in the Aſhes, the Smoke and Flame grow together into Soot, as it were a Meteor, in which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152521:12"/>
are comprehended together, Spirit, Sulphur, Salt, Water, and Earth, as it were in a certain compendium of the mixture. For the active Principles abound in Soot, more than in any other inanimate Body.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe with ſome there hath ſpread a certain ſuſpicion, that thoſe our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, chiefly the Saline and Sulphureous, are to be produced for the moſt part by Fire, and are no ways to be found in mixt things, unleſs after the coming between of that: I will witneſs to you in ſome inſtances, that the thing is plainly otherwiſe. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the firſt, It is commonly known, that the Aſhes of every Plant, being once E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixivated, or made into a Lye, if it be afterwards Calcined, will not yield any thing of Salt; beſides if Concretes being Diſtilled, Exhale or Breath forth a very ſharp or acid Liquor, their Calx is not ſaltiſh; and on the contrary when the Salt being Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilized or brought to a Flux, aſcends the Alembic, you ſhall ſeek for it in vain in the dead head. To prove the exiſtency of the Sulphureous Principle in Vegetables, take Guaiacum, or a piece of any other ponderous Wood, and being put into a Glaſs Retort, draw it forth by degrees; it ſhall exhibit, together with an Acid Liquor (which water is ſaltiſh) in great quantity, a blackiſh Oyl (which part of it is Sulphureous.) It appears from hence that this was in the Body before the Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and in no wiſe produced by its Operation, becauſe if you proceed after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner, that the Sulphur may be taken out of the Concrete before Diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Liquor that comes forth will be almoſt wholy deprived of its Oylineſs: Wherefore, if you pour Spirit of Wine to thoſe Chips of Wood, it will Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract in a great quantity, by this Menſtruum, a pure Refine, which is the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous part it ſelf: then if you Diſtil (as before) in a Retort, the remaining Chips being waſhed in common Water and dryed, you will have a very little Oyl only. What is more to be admired, and confirms alſo more fully the truth of this kind of Origination, ſome Bodies, which being almoſt deſtitute of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Sulphur (becauſe chiefly Volatile) conſiſt chiefly of Salt, Earth and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are ſeparated into theſe Elements by Diſtillation: the ſame mixture in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and wholy known by the ſame accidents, is reſtored to them, being min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled together again; for example, if you Diſtil Vitriol in a Reverberating Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, you ſhall have a Phlegm almoſt inſipid, or a Watery part, then a Liquor ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſour, or a Salt having gotten a Flux, and in the bottom, a Red Earth, and finely Purpled: this being rightly performed, if the two Diſtilled Liquors be poured to the dead head, you ſhall have the ſame Vitriol, as you had before, and again revived, in the ſame Colour, taſt, yea and almoſt in weight. In like manner you may proceed, with the ſame ſucceſs, with Nitre, Sea-Salt, Salt of Tartar, and perhaps with Alum and other Minerals: So that thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes, which conſiſt of fixed, and ſtable Elements, may like a Mechanick En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine be pulled into pieces, and preſently without hurting the Machine, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored or made whole. But there is enough ſpoken concerning the Principles of Natural Bodies. Theſe being thus premiſed, we will proceed to the thing propoſed in the beginning, to wit, the Doctrine of Fermentation.</p>

                     <p>FErmentation is an inteſtine motion of Particles, or the principles of every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, either tending to the perfection of the ſame Body, or becauſe of its change into another. For the Elementary Particles being ſtirred up into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either of their own accord or Nature, or occaſionally, do wonderful more themſelves, and are moved; do lay hold of and obvolve one another: the ſubtil and more active, unfold themſelves on every ſide, and endeavour to fly away; which notwithſtanding being intangled, by others more thick, are deteined in their flying
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152521:13"/>
away. Again, the more thick themſelves, are very much brought under, by the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Expanſion of the more Subtil, and are attenuated, until each of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to their height and exaltations, they either frame the due perfection in the ſubject, or compleat the alterations and mutations deſigned by Nature.</p>
                     <p>Fermentation is an action or motion meerly Natural, and what doth perform it, are only Particles Naturally implanted in the Concrete; yet as to the ſubjects in which they are found, it is wont to be variouſly diſtinguiſhed. And either things of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are ſaid to Ferment in a threefold Family, of Minerals, Vegetables and Animals; or the Works of Art, to wit, when Actives are applied to Paſſives by an outward A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. Though the Term and conſideration of Fermentation, are chiefly due to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial things, and things made by Hand; yet it will not be from the purpoſe, to ſpeak firſt ſomthing of Natural Things, that a Compariſon being made of either, the Truth of our Hypotheſis, and the certainty of the Principles may be confirmed. But this only lightly and by the way, in this place I ſhall paſs over, becauſe their more full handling belongs to Phyſiology, or the Diſcourſe of Natural or Phyſical Things.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, as to Minerals, altho in the Bowels of the Earth, the Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is leſs conſpicuous than in the Superficies, yet it eaſily appears that the Elementary Particles, or the Fermentative Principles, are included in the depth of the Earth, as in a certain pregnant Womb: which there conſtitute Concretes, and things gathered together, by ſtrict Embraces, the Productions of Minerals; but being looſned, and moved in the Boſom of the Earth, or exhaled upwards, cauſe the appearances of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Generation of the more hard Minerals, induces rather Congelation than Fermentation; becauſe indeed theſe Principles, growing together in every Subject, are ſo fixed, and as it were bound together in Bonds, that they are not able any ways to move themſelves, or to depart one from another. This kind of Fixation chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the plenty and greater proportion of Salt and Earth, (ſomtimes with an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sulphur) than there is of Spirit or Water, To wit, Salt and Earth, being moſt ſmally broken, and reſolved even into a Vapour, lay hold of one another, and ſtiffen into a hard matter, and at laſt not to be looſned; almoſt after the ſame manner as making of Glaſs, and the burning of Bricks and Earthen Ware, are performed. For Glaſs conſiſts of Salt and Earth, which when being broken into moſt ſmall bits by a very intenſe Fire, they ſuffer a Flux, they mutually lay hold of one another, and ſo ſtrictly and intimately come together, that they are never to be parted. Glaſs is more fragil, or eaſie to be broken, than Earthen Pots, or Minerals, becauſe it has a greater plenty of Salt, than of Earth, which is more plentiful in Earthen Ware, and in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals: To ſome of which, alſo happens a modicum of Sulphur, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they are more tenacious and ductil; as is to be obſerved in Metals, when in the mean time ſtones, and what contain little of Sulphur, are fragil, and apt by every ſtroke, to fly to pieces. In Vitrification there is need of a violent Fire, for the fuſion of the Salt and the Earth, (whoſe Particles, as is commonly ſaid, are the Peſtles of the Chymiſts) but within the Bowels of the Earth, there is not required ſuch a fuſion by Fire, for the Concretion of Minerals, becauſe Salt and Sulphur exiſt, being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally reſolved into moſt ſimple Particles; which, when they lay hold on the Earth, eaſily ſtiffen into Metal, or into a ſtony hardneſs. There are ſome Fountains found out, which, for that they flow with a Primitive Salt, and reſolved into ſmall Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, what ever Bodies are immerſed therein, they cauſe them preſently to become ſtony. We have read alſo, of Men changed into Stones, yea a whole City to have been ſtiffned into a ſtony ſubſtance, by the Air, or by ſome Vapour brought forth of the Earth: The Faith of which thing is left to the Authors.</p>
                     <p>Meteors are made out of the ſame Principles by which Minerals are made, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived almoſt in the ſame Womb: but looſned from Concretion wandring here and there, and diverſly fluctuating: or which being included in Subterraneous Vaults, and there moved, produce divers Springings up of Fountains, or ebullitions of hot Vapours; or exhaling from the Dens of the Earth, and being mixed with Airy little Bodies, they cauſe within the Region of the Atmo-Sphear, as it were a diverſe faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Landskip, of Clouds, Winds, and the appearances of other things, in the Superficies of the Earth, or on high: in either there are highly active Principles, chiefly Salt and Sulphur. Spirits are either deficient in Meteors, even as in Minerals, or are found only in a very ſmall quantity or proportion: to wit, they are almoſt wholly excluded from theſe, by reaſon of the ſtrict frame of the Subject, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152521:13"/>
doth not eaſily yield ſpace, and paſſage for their motion; alſo they abſtain from thoſe (<hi>viz.</hi> Meteors) by reaſon of the lax, and wholly looſe ſtructure of Matter, from whence they, who are mighty in ſwiftneſs, eaſily break forth, and deſire to fly away.</p>
                     <p>Within the Boſome of the Earth, the Saline Particles being looſned, even into a Vapour, and then kneaded with an Earthy Matter or the moiſtning of Waters, they cauſe Eruptions of Fountains, and Acidulous or Spaw Waters, which reſemble the diſpoſition of Vitriol, Alum, Nitre, ſomtimes of Iron or Copper. Alſo the Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous little Bodies being looſned, and gathered together, inkindle an Heat, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Subterraneous Fires; by whoſe Breaths the Dens and Caverns being made Hot, like an Hot-Houſe, whilſt the Watery humors paſs through them, they from thence conceive their Heat, and ſupply the Springs of Hot Fountains for Bathes.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, in this viſible and Etherial world, Vapours both Sulphureous and Saline, and of a diverſe Kind and Nature, perpetually breath forth, and are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed through the whole Region of Air. From hence the diverſity of winds, the viciſſitudes of Cold and Heat, Rain, Snow, Hail, Dew, and Hoar Froſt, and what are of this Nature, have their Origine. Concerning the particular inſtances of theſe, the famous <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> may be conſulted, who in his <hi>Epicurean</hi> Philoſophy, moſt aptly deduces the Phaenomena, almoſt of all Meteors, and the reaſons of them, from the Exhalations of Sulphur, and Salts, either Nitrous, Vitriolick, Aluminous or Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of Fermentation for as much as is obſerved in Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</head>
                     <p>IN Vegetables, Fermentation is yet more plainly diſcerned: for whilſt they Bud forth, Grow, Flower, bear Fruit, Ripen, Decline and Dye, we may obſerve the divers motions of Particles or Principles, their various Habits and Tempers. I intend not here to deſcribe the ſeveral ways and proceedings of theſe. It will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, for the unfolding the Doctrine of Fermentation, to take notice of ſome chief inſtances, concerning this Subject.</p>
                     <p>If is manifeſt, by dayly Experience, that all Plants whatſoever, expoſed to a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrical or Chymical Operation, may with little labour, be reſolved into the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid five-fold Elements: But in ſome there is found a greater plenty of Salt, in others of Sulphur; in ſome Spirits abound: Water, and Earth, are in moſt proportionated, according to the Bulk and magnitude of the thing. Plants in which Salt abounds, with a mean of Sulphur, and a little quantity of Spirits, are for the moſt part of long Age, ſomwhat big, or flouriſh all the Winter, or tho their Leaves fall, they keep a Nutricious Juice under the Bark. Of which ſort are the Oak, Aſh, Elm, Box-Tree, and all ponderous Woods and Shrubs.</p>
                     <p>In ſome Sulphur abounds, with a little Salt and Spirit, as are the Pine, the Firr-Tree, Cyprus Tree, Juniper, Ivy, Olive, Cedar, and Myrtle Trees, and all reſinous Plants; which, for the moſt part have a ſweet ſmell, and are perpetually Green, by reaſon the juice, wherewith they are nouriſhed, is viſcous, and not eaſily to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated. In others, beſides plenty of Salt, and Sulphur, Spirits alſo are found, in a greater proportion, as are Fruit-bearing Trees, and eſpecially the Vine, from whoſe Fruit the Juice being wrung out, and purified by Fermentation, grows very big with Spirit. Of this rank are Plants for the moſt part Medicinal, alſo ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Curious, and Odoriferous Flowers, But in ſome Water and Earth luxuriat in too great a quantity above the other Elements, as in cold Plants, and ſuch as grow in too rank a Soil.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:152521:14"/>The Germination of Plants happens after this manner, either it is made out of the Seed, Root, Trunk, or of its own Nature, from the naked matrix of the Earth. Firſt, the Spirit being ſhut up within, by the Ambient Heat and Moiſture looſening the frame of the mixture, being looſned, it preſently endeavours to fly away: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held back in its flight, by the more thick Particles of the reſt, ſtretches forth more largely its Den, and together with the other Principles, with which it is bound, thruſts forth on every ſide, into length and breadth: even as a little bundle of Silk, being contracted into wrincles and folds, is opened here and there: In the mean time, the little Spaces left by the enlargement of the Spirit, and as it were made hollow, are filled up by the next Matter, driven even into the Vacuities. And after this manner the Architect Spirit, with his Miniſters, Salt and Sulphur, ſtill ſtretching forth it ſelf, like a Snail, frames for it ſelf an Houſe, whoſe Inhabitant it is, and by dilating it ſelf, ſtretches forth that, until at laſt it hath wrought the Plant into the due Bulk and Figure deſigned by Nature.</p>
                     <p>You may take notice, that the times of the year, for the Budding, Flowring, Ripening, and decaying of Vegetables, are of great Efficacy and Virtue: All the Winter, the Womb of the Earth, as it were ſhut up, is almoſt barren: for the Spirituous Particles, which are wont to actuate the reſt, and as it were to lead the dance of Natural Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are either chaſed away by the Winters Cold, or being Congealed in their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, are fixed: Wherefore at this time Germination and Vegetation are very rare, unleſs that ſome irregular Plants, which are compoſed of plenty of Spirit, Salt, and Sulphur, dare to break forth. But in the Spring, when the bowels of the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be a little warm, by the Vicinity of the Sun, preſently they are impregnated with a wonderful Fecundity, and produce the effects of their Seminality. Not only the Superficies of the Earth, but alſo the Water and Air, every where, grow big with Spirituous Particles; which as it were raiſe up from the Dead, the little Bodies of Salt, and Sulphur, and bring them into Motion: Therefore, beſides that the Plants Bud, the Juice and Blood of living Creatures is quicker and more apt to abound. At this time the Birds and Fiſhes build their Neſts, and bring forth Eggs: alſo we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in our ſelves the Blood to flow high in the Veſſels, and uſually to Ferment too much. For all things are then full of this Aetherial Subſtance, and the whole Bulk of Nature, as it were inſpired by a lively Fermentation, is abundantly fruitful of Motions and Generations. Yea, theſe our Principles, at firſt ſeparated and diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed one from another, led as it were by an Appetite of Copulation, enter into mutual Marriages, and being Married together, almoſt with infinit Embraces, cauſe a moſt ample Seeding, and Germination of the Herby State.</p>
                     <p>At the beginning of the Summer, (and perhaps in ſome ſooner in ſome later) when ſufficient time hath been granted for the Stature and Magnitude of every Plant, and that it is now come to the highth of increaſe; it behoves Nature to perfect her Work, and to cook and ripen the Subſtance, as yet rude and undigeſted: Wherefore the active Principles leiſurely extricate themſelves from the more thick, and creep forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the top, there being placed with a mutual increaſe, they are formed into Flowers and Bloſſoms, from which at length (for that they are of a ſoft and light texture) Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Sulphur eaſily evaporate, and the frame of the mixture quickly decays. But Nature careful of the perpetuating every thing, when it cannot keep for ever the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduum, is ſo provident, that the Species may not wholly periſh: Wherefore ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes new and more firm and laſting Combinations of Spirit, Salt and Sulphur. For ſhe ſelects from the whole Subſtance of the Plant, the more noble and highly active Particles, and theſe being gathered together, with a little Earth and Water, ſhe forms in the Seed, as it were the quinteſſences of every Plant; in the mean time the Trunk, Leaves, Stalks, and the other Members of the Plant, being almoſt quite deprived of the active Principles, are much depauperated, and are of leſs Efficacy and Virtue.</p>
                     <p>About Autumn, after the Seeds are framed, (as it were pledges left in memory of the Plant) the Particles of Spirits, Salt and Sulphur, which remain, being now placed in their Strength or Exaltation, endeavour a Diſſolution, and Departing one from another. And firſt of all, the Spirits evaporate by degrees with the Watery humour, through the Doors ſet open by the Summer Sun, with which the more pure parts of the Sulphur, make alſo their Journey: in the mean time the Salt being fixed with the Earth, and more thick Sulphur, is left behind: Wherefore in moſt the Leaves fall at this time, and in thoſe of a tender and light Conſtitution, the Principles are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:152521:14"/>
wholly diſſipated, and the Trunk and Stalk, together with the Root, wholly die. In ſome, after the falling of the Seed, with the Leaves, the Stalks wither; in the mean time the Principles, which may renew the Plant in the next Spring, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Root.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Winter coming on, the face of things is wholly changed; and the Elements, which in the Spring did affect to be Joyned and to Marry one with another, ſeek no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than Divorces. The Spirits fly away from very many things, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Air; in the mean time the Particles of Salt and Sulphur lie as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed and aſleep. Not only the Bodies of Vegetables, but of very many Animals, are left as it were dead all the Winter, till they are raiſed again to life by the Spirit, returning with the Vernal Sun, and as it were animated anew. But this little Branch being made concerning the Vegetation of Plants, it is now fit that we proceed on our Journey to Fermentation, by the Rule of our before eſtabliſhed Method, to what is to be obſerved, concerning the parts, and humours of Living Creatures.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of things to be Obſerved of Fermentation about Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</head>
                     <p>IT is ſo certain that the Bodies of Animals, conſiſt of the aforeſaid Principles, that it wants no proof. For they ſo plentifully ſwell up, with Spirit, Salt and Sulphur, that their Particles are obvious to the ſenſe: Wherefore they are moved with a more ſwift motion, and more excellent ſenſes of Life, and Functions of Heat, in the Subjects, in which they are implanted, are inlarged. It would be too much labour, and tedious, here to deſcribe, the ſeveral manners and proceſſes of Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. The firſt beginnings of Life proceed from the Spirit Fermenting in the Heart, as it were in a certain little punct. The motion of this, is not as in Vegetables, ſlow and inſenſible, and only to be known by their increaſing; but preſently becoming rapid, is conſpicuous to the Eyes: becauſe the Spirit leaping from the Punct, as from a Priſon, being ſtirred, and having obtained the Vehicle of Blood, ſwiftly runs forth; and leaping forth, it cannot wholy fly away, it makes hollow ſpaces for it ſelf in the thick ſubſtance, in which it is included, for its excurſion, being compelled ſome other way backward. Laſtly being returned to the Heart, it Ferments the more, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſtretches forth further the ſpaces of its Excurſion, and ſo eaſily makes an hollow way for its return back; and after this manner, for the carrying about the Blood, Arteries and Veins, as Channels and Rivulets are framed through all the parts of the Body: and on ſuch a Viciſſitude of Motion, or Reciprocation, depends the life of living Creatures, which, that Nature might preſerve a long while, ſhe placed the Ferment in the Heart, by whoſe inſtinct, or endeavour, the Blood grows impetuouſly Hot, and as it were inkindled into a Flame by its Deflagration, diffuſes the <hi>effluvia</hi> of its Heat round about on every ſide: for by the Fermentation, or Accenſion which the Blood ſuffers in the Boſome of the Heart, very many Particles of Spirit, Salt and Sulphur, endeavour to break forth from its looſened frame: by which being much rarified, and like Water boyling over a Fire, the moved and boyling Blood is carried through the Veſſels, not without great Tumult and Turgeſcency. We would ſpeak more in this place, both of the Natural Fermentation of the Blood, and the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh, but that we reſerve this Conſideration for a peculiar Tract, where we Treat of Feavers.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this Ferment conſtituted in the Chimny of the Heart, upon which the motion and heat of the Blood very much depends, there are others laid up every where in the Bowels, of a diverſe diſpoſition, by the help of which, both the Chyle (which is the Rudiment or Beginning of the Blood) and the Animal Spirits, its Quinteſſence, are truly framed. There are others alſo which ſerve for the perfecting the Blood, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muting it into other Liquors, and freeing it from Excrementitious Matter: It will
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152521:15"/>
be too far from our propoſed method, to wander, to inſiſt upon each of theſe, and to reap anothers Harveſt: Wherefore I will only add in this place, ſome ſelect inſtances, which may illuſtrate the Doctrine of Fermentation.</p>
                     <p>It is commonly received, that the Concoction of the Chyle, in the Ventricle, is made by the means of a certain Acid Ferment: That ſuch a thing is the Acid belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a full Stomach, and the want of it in the loſs of Stomach, in Feaveriſh and Dyſenterical people do teſtifie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and its reſtitution a ſign of Health: to which may be added this Obſervation; Chalybeat Medicines being taken at the Mouth, a little after excite a Sulfureous ſavour in the Throat, as if hard roſted Eggs had been eaten: which ſeems wholly to be made by the Acid Ferment of the Ventricle, gnawing the Iron, even as Spirit of Vitriol, being ſprinkled upon the fileings of Steel, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites ſuch a ſtinking and Sulphureous Odor. Some ſay this Ferment is breathed into the Stomach from the Spleen, but by what means that may be done doth not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by Anatomical Obſervation. It ſeems not improbable that this Ferment is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the Ventricle, that it is only made by ſome remains of the perfected Chyle, which fixed in the folds of the Ventricle. and there growing ſowr, puts on the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Ferment; even as a portion of Dough being fermented or levened, and and kept to a ſowrneſs, becomes a convenient Ferment or Leven, for the making of Bread. In like manner this kind of Acid humour being prepared from the Aliments, and long carried in the Ventricle, promotes the Concoction, and ſubaction or ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Food. For Acid things, which are full of Salt, carried out to a Flux, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently conduce both to the Fermenting and Diſſolving of Bodies: Wherefore by the action of this, Salt and Sulphur, with which eatable things very much abound, are broken in the Ventricle, and are reduced into very ſmall parts. The Chyle being after this manner Fermented, acquires a Milky colour, by reaſon that the Sulphureous Particles are diſſolved together with the Saline, and mixed with the Acid Ferment. For if you pour an Acetous humour to any Liquor impregnated with Sulphur and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt, it preſently grows white like Milk; as may be diſcerned in the preparing the Milk of Sulphur, or the Reſinous extracts of Vegetables. Yea, the Spirits of Harts Horn, or Soot, being very full of Volatile Salt, if they be poured to any Acid Liquor, or ſimple Water, acquire a Milky colour.</p>
                     <p>Concerning this Ferment hid in the folds of the Ventricle, it is obſerved that it is after various manners, and changes the Aliments by a diverſe means: for tho in a ſound Conſtitution it is indifferently Acid, and chiefly owes its force and energie to the Salt being brought to a Flux; yet it often declines from this laudable condition, and conteins in it ſelf either too much of ſowrneſs, or leſs than it ought to have: In the former Caſe, where the Salt hath got too ſowr a Dominion, all things taken in, (the Saline Particles being carried forth to a Flux, and the reſt unduly brought under) preſently grow ſour: as moſt often happens in Hypochondriack Diſtempers: on the other ſide, where the Volatile Principles obtain the firſt place, (Fermentation being too haſtily made) the Sulphureous parts of the Chyle are ſuddenly, and as it were force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably exalted; and the unconcocted of the Saline, paſs into Choler: which ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily happens to thoſe abounding with bitter Choler. They therefore who have the Ventricle affected after this latter manner, Sweet and Fat meats being eaten, they are troubled with a bitter and bilious Taſte: Again, they who ſuffer the contrary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, altho they eat the moſt ſimple Food, ſend forth plentifully Acid and Stinking belchings: and indeed this ſeems to come to paſs even after the ſame manner, as when a little too much Yeſt is put to the Batch of Dough, it becomes bitter; or when too great a Portion of ſour Ferment, or Leven is put to the ſame Dough, the Bread from thence contracts a mighty ſowrneſs.</p>
                     <p>As the Blood in the Heart, and appending Veſſels, the Chyle in the Ventricle, ſo the Animal Spirit is wrought in the Brain, whoſe Original and Motions are very much in the dark. Neither doth it plainly appear, as to the Animal Spirit, by what work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man it is prepared, nor by what Channels it is carried, at a diſtance, quicker than the twinkling of an Eye. But it ſeems to me that the Brain with Scull over it, and the appending Nerves, repreſent the little Head or Glaſſie Alembic, with a Spunge laid upon it, as we uſe to do for the highly rectifying of the Spirit of Wine: for truly the Blood when Rarified by Heat, is carried from the Chimny of the Heart, to the Head, even as the Spirit of Wine boyling in the Cucurbit, and being reſolved into Vapour, is elevated into the Alembick; where the Spunge covering all the opening of the Hole, only tranſmits or ſuffers to paſs through the more penetrating and very ſubtil
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152521:15"/>
Spirits, and carries them to the ſnout of the Alembick: in the mean time, the more thick Particles, are ſtayed, and hindred from paſſing. Not unlike this manner, the blood being delated into the Head, its ſpirituous, volatil, and ſubtil Particles, being reſtrained within by the Skull, and its <hi>menynges,</hi> as by an Alembick, are drunk up by the ſpungy ſubſtance of the Brain, and there being made more noble or excellent, are derived into the Nerves, as ſo many ſnouts hanging to it. In the mean time the more craſs or thick Particles of the blood, being hindred from entring, are carried back by Circulation: But the highly agil and ſubtil Spirits enter the ſmalleſt and ſcarcely at all open pores of the Brain and Nerves, and run through them with a wonderful ſwiftneſs: For there is need only of ſuch Receptacles and Channels, for the Animal Spirit, in which there are none, or at leaſt very ſmall cavities or holes; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the blood or excrementitious humours, their Followers and Companions would not be excluded. Alſo, beſides, if theſe Spirits ſhould run about through too open and looſe ſpaces, being eaſily diſſipated, they would fly away: wherefore, when there is need of a Pipe for the tranſmitting of blood, or ſerous water, the Spirit of Wine runs rapidly through the ſecret paſſages of the Inſtrument or Leather. Neither doth the more ſtrict frame of the Brain and Nerves ſerve only for the ſtraining of the ſubtil from the thick, and the pure from the impure; but alſo that ſpirituous and moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Liquor, being as it were diſtilled from the blood, gets yet a farther perfection in the Brain; for there being inſpired by a certain Ferment, whereby it is yet more volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſed, it is made more fit for the performing the offices of motion and ſenſe. Becauſe the ſubſtance of the Brain is exceeding full of a Volatile Salt, which is of great Virtue for the ſharpning and ſubtiliſing the Spirits; therefore the Spirits of Harts Horn, or of Soot, are far more penetrating than Spirits of Wine.</p>
                     <p>The Seminal Veſſels and Genital Parts, do ſo ſwell up with Fermentative Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that there is nothing more: here Spirit, Salt, and Sulphur, being together compacted, and highly exalted, ſeem in the Seed to be reduced as it were into a moſt noble Elixir. Theſe kind of active Principles do not only Ferment in the Womb, for the forming of the Child or Young ones, but alſo as it were with a living Ferment, they inſpire through all the Body, the whole Maſs of blood, that it may be more Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and more ſharply Hot: wherefore in women who have the Ferment of the Womb in good order, their Face is furniſhed with a curious and flouriſhing colour, their heat is more lively and copious; moreover, the Maſs of Blood growing too rank, there is need of emptying it every Month by the Flux of their Courſes; but when this Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation from the Womb is wanting, both Virgins and Women become Pale, and as it were without blood, ſhort winded, and unfit for any motion. Alſo in men, from the Seminal Ferment, happen abundance of heat, great ſtrength, a ſounding Voice, and a manly eruption of Beard and Hair; by reaſon of the defect of this, men grow womaniſh, to wit, a ſmall Voice, weak Heat, and want of Beard are cauſed.</p>
                     <p>Since we Treat of Ferments, which are found in the Animal Body, we may here opportunely inquire, what is the uſe of the Spleen: concerning which all good things are ſaid by ſome; that it is as it were another Liver, and ſerves for the making of blood, for the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the lower Belly: It is by others reputed to be of a moſt vile uſe; that it is only the Sink or Jakes, into which the Feculencies of the blood are caſt. By reaſon of its ſtructure, we make this ſort of conjecture; becauſe the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, do carry the blood to this, and the Veins bring it away, neither any other thing is carried in, or conveyed out, and for that its ſubſtance is filled with black, and ſtagnating blood, it ſeems that it is as it were a ſtore-houſe for the receiving of the earthy and muddy part of the blood: which afterwards, being exalted into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Ferment, is carried back to the blood for the heating of it: Wherefore, while the blood being carried by the Arteries enters the Spleen, ſomthing is drawn from it, to wit, the muddy and terreſtrial Particles, which are as it were the dregs, and <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of the blood; that by this means the whole Maſs of the Blood, might be freed from the Melancholick or Atrabilous Juice; which is ſeparated in the Spleen, even as the yellow Bile or Choller, is in the Liver: wherefore, for the moſt part the Spleen is of a black or blewiſh colour, by reaſon of the Feculencies or dregs there lay'd up. But as this Juice depoſited in the Milt or Spleen, is not altogether unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, but by reaſon of the plenty of fixed Salt, is of a very Fermenting Nature; it is not preſently, as the Choler, caſt into the ſink, but is farther Cooked in the Spleen, and being exalted goes into a Ferment; which being laſtly committed to the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152521:16"/>
blood, promotes its motion and Volatiliſation: Wherefore, as ſomthing is drawn from the blood, entring the Spleen by the Arteries, to wit, the Crude Juice of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy; ſo ſomthing is continually added to the ſame, flowing back through the Veins, to wit, the ſame Juice concocted and exalted into the Nature of a Ferment: Even as Chymiſts, in Diſtilling, that the Liquor may be made better, ſeparate the Subtile and Spirituous parts, from the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> and then pour them on it again; and this work they ſo often repeat, till the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> or dead Head, is by frequent Diſtillation Volatized, and the Liquor rightly exalted, even in all its Particles. That this is the uſe of the Spleen, it is a ſign, for that this inward being ill affected, the blood either ferments too much, as in the Scorbutick and Hypochondriack Diſtempers; or if the Spleen be obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or beſet with a Scirrhous Tumor, the blood is deſtitute of fit Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and cauſes the Dropſie, Cachexie or evil diſpoſition of the Body, or the Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                     <p>As we aſſert, the Earth and muddy part of the blood, which conſiſts chiefly of Earth and fixed Salt, being ſeparated in the Spleen, to paſs there into a Ferment; ſo it ſeems not improbable, that alſo the Aduſt, or as it were the fiery part of the blood, to wit, the Yellow Bile, which conſiſts chiefly of Salt and Sulphur, being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated in the Liver, and from thence tranſmitted to the inteſtines, ſerves for ſome uſe of Fermentation. For this being mixed with the Chyme or Juice, fallen from the Ventricle to the inteſtines, makes it there to grow hot and to ſwell up; whereby both the Elementary Particles are more overcome, and by reaſon of the Rarification or ſwelling up, the purer part is wrung forth into the Milky Veſſels, for the Nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Juice.</p>
                     <p>We are not only born and nouriſhed by the means of Ferments; but we alſo die: Every Diſeaſe acts its Tragedies by the ſtrength of ſome Ferment. For either the Sulphureous and Spirituous part of the blood, being too much carried forth, boils up immoderately in the Veſſels, like Wine growing hot, and from thence Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of a divers kind and nature are inkindled: or ſomtimes the Saline part of the blood, being too much carried forth, ſuffers a Flux; and from thence it being made acid, auſtere, and ſomtimes ſharp, is apt for various Coagulations: from which the Scurvy, Dropſie, Stone, Leproſie, and very many Chronical Diſeaſes ariſe.</p>
                     <p>Yea we alſo endeavor the Cure of Diſeaſes by the help of Fermentation: For to the preſerving or recovering the Health of man, the buſineſs of a Phyſician and a Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is almoſt the ſame: the blood and humors even as Wine, ought to be kept in an equal temper and motion of Fermentation: wherefore when the blood grows too hot, even as Wine, it is uſual to empty ſome out of the Veſſels, and to allay its Fervor with temperat things. If any extraneous or heterogeneous thing, is mixed with it, unleſs growing hot of its own accord, it drives it forth of doors; Purging, Vomiting, and Sweating Medicines, by ſhaking and fuſing the blood and humors, promote its ſecluſion: when that the blood is depauperated, and grows leſs hot than it ſhould do, Cardiacks, Digeſtives, and eſpecially Chalybeats or ſteeled Medicines reſtore its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and Fermentation: no otherwiſe than Wines growing ſowr or degenerating into a deadneſs or want of ſtrength, are mixed with more rich Lees, whereby they may Purge or grow turgid anew. I could eaſily unfold the Curatory intentions, as alſo the effects and operations of every Medicine, according to the Doctrine of Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but I deſign a particular meditation for this thing: for the perfecting of which ſerious work, God willing, I have determined to add to the buſineſs of Medicine, as I hope, ſomthing not unprofitable.</p>
                     <p>Having thus far wandered in the ſpacious field of Nature, we have beheld all things full of Fermentation; not only in the diſtinct Provinces of Minerals, Vegetables and Animals, do we diſcern the motions and effects of this, but alſo the whole Sublunary world, ſeems as if one and the ſame ſubſtance were planted, and very pregnant through the whole with Fermentative Particles; which in every Region and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, as little Emmits in a Mole-hill, are buſied in perpetual motion and agitation; they fly about here and there; ſomtimes upwards, ſomtimes downward they are hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, they variouſly meet one another, aſſociate themſelves, and again depart aſunder; with a continual Viciſſitude they enter into divers Marriages, and ſuffer Divorces, on which the beginnings, the death, and tranſmutations of things depend. Theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bodies do not only very much abound in the boſome of the Earth, or in the midſt of the waters, but they are eſpecially diffuſed through the whole Atmoſphear of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:152521:16"/>
Air in thick heaps. It is ſufficient that I have noted in this place, ſome examples in a word: I have not determined a more full ſpeculation of them here. It is time that we proceed from Phyſical things, to the works of Art.</p>

                     <p>IN the works of Art, ſo various and manifold proviſion of Fermentation is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that it is altogether impoſſible to enumerate their ſeveral Species; or to reduce the divers inſtances of this to certain Claſſes or Heads of diſtribution. Making uſe of the thrid of the following method, we will ſubjoyn ſome exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, (which have happened to our obſervation) by whoſe rule, many others may be laid open.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Fermentation, which is made in the Subjects, made by hand, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man induſtry, theſe three things are chiefly to be conſidered.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>Firſt, of what Nature and Compoſition Bodies are, that are moſt fit for Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and which are leſs convenient for it.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, What things are requiſite about Fermentation, to wit, what are wont to promote, or alſo to hinder its motion in every Subject.</item>
                        <item>Thirdly, How manifold the motion of Fermentation is, and the end of it; alſo what are the effects and alterations which follow it.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>As to the firſt, That all Bodies, (when tending to perfection) may truely Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are required,</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, That there be ſome parts looſe and disjoyned; otherwiſe the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative Particles will not be ſtretched forth, or move from place to place: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the more hard compacted things, or in viſcous things, or too much boyled, or evaporated to a ſpiſſitude or dryneſs, Fermentation does not ſucceed. What are Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, as Wine, Beer, the Juices of Fruits and Herbs, eaſily and quickly ſwell up; next to theſe what are ſoft, tho they are of a thicker Conſiſtency, as Bread, and moſt Eatable things, and Medicinal Compoſitions.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is required that there be an Heterogeneity of parts, or a confuſion of all the Principles together; to wit, that ſome Particles do oppoſe others, and ſtir them into motion. For the more ſimple Bodies, in which one, or at moſt two Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only are ſtrong, with a very ſmall proportion of the reſt, are unapt to Ferment: becauſe like Particles, or Symbolical Elements, lie benumed and quiet. But between the unlike, there ariſes preſently a ſtrife for domination, and ſome provoke others into motion.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There is a third condition, that there be neither too much Crudity, nor Maturity of parts, in the body Fermenting. In the former, the active and ſubtil Particles, are not eaſily extricated from the more thick, nor are brought into motion: as it appears in Juices, which are preſſed forth from unripe Fruit; alſo in Beer which is made of Barly or Mault, not come forth or germinated. In the latter the Particles being made too volatile, are not contained in the bond of the mixture, but preſently evaporate, and diſpoſe their Subjects to Putrefaction. Wherefore, Juice expreſſed from Summer Fruits, or others too ripe, will not eaſily paſs into Wine, but it will quickly corrupt. And for this reaſon, extravaſated blood, milk, and urine, do not Ferment, but quickly putrifie.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſecond thing propoſed, there are many ways by which Fermentation is either promoted or hindred. The firſt and chiefeſt, is the adding of a certain Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the body Fermenting; the Particles of which, when being firſt placed in vigor and motion, may raiſe up the others, idle and ſluggiſh, in the to-be-fermented Maſs, and may drive them into motion. But there is a two-fold Ferment; either abſolute, which is the ſame kind of Body, in which the active Particles, being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152521:17"/>
placed in their vigor, are notably in motion, and ſo whilſt they are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Subject in Fermenting, ſnatch with them into motion other Particles there of the every kind before ſluggiſh: by this means Barm or Yeſt, beaten Eggs, and ſuch like, ſtir up a Fermentation almoſt in every thing. Or the Ferment is reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, to wit, which conſiſts of Particles, very much of one kind, which meeting other of another kind, in the Maſs to be Fermented, grow hot with them, and ſo produce in the mixture a turgency or riſing up of all the parts together. After this manner Saline Particles having gotten a Flux, grow very hot, with other Salines, either fixed or alchaliſate; as appears when acetous Liquors are poured on Corrals, Harts Horn, ſhells of Fiſhes; alſo when the Spirit of Vitriol, and the Salt of Tartar, are put together, a great ebullition is excited.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome accidents and external circumſtances, which variouſly conduce, either to the provoking or hindring the motion of Fermentation; of which ſort, are chiefly the condition of the Ambient Air, the placing or laying up of the body Ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the means of conſerving it.</p>
                     <p>The Southern Air (in which hot and humid Particles every where abound, which alſo entring eaſily any Bodies, obtain the force and place of a Ferment) impreſſes a notable motion of Fermentation in very many things: Wherefore in drinkable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, it doth not only raiſe up at firſt, the force of efferveſcency or growing hot, but alſo for a long while after induces new ſwellings up in them being Fermented. On the contrary, the Cold and Northern Air, binds up, and very much faſtens Bodies; and in very many things hinders the fuſions, and flowings of the Elements, and oftentimes, either hinders Fermentation from being ſtirred up, or reſtrains it being begun. Alſo the hot Summer Air, becauſe it too much moves the active Principles, drives away the Spirits and ſubtile parts, exalts the Saline, and Sulphureous into a Flux, and ſo perverts their equal motion; and either the Sulphur or Salt being too much carried forth, it eaſily brings to Bodies a rancidneſs or putrefaction, or a mouldineſs; which nothing favours the buſineſs of Fermentation.</p>
                     <p>It is a vulgar opinion, that ſome ſelect times of the year, to wit, thoſe in which the Vegetables of every Kind flower, cauſe anew the motion of Fermentation in the Juices, and other things prepared of them, after they had Fermented a long time before; ſo that Beer, when the Barly, and Wines in the time that the Vine, flowers, conceive riſings up, or new Fermentations: they ſay alſo, that Bread and Flour, when the Wheat is in Flower, is want to become ſooner muſty and moldy: alſo that ſpots or ſtains of the Juices of Fruits, as the Mulberry, Blackberry, Rasberry, and ſuch like, being in Cloaths, are wont to be gotten forth again, at that time when thoſe Fruits are Ripe. Concerning theſe things, I ingenuouſly confeſs, that I have not made tryal of them, by my own proper obſervation; ſo as to dare to affirm it for truth in every part: I will therefore lightly paſs them over, for it would both grieve and ſhame me (leſt I ſhould relate falſe things) to Philoſophize concerning doubtful things.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the laying up of the Fermenting Body, theſe things are chiefly to be obſerved. When things firſt being to Ferment, that they are not to be ſhut up in too cloſe Veſſels, neither while the Liquors are hot, are they to be put into Bottles or Casks. For the Particles, at firſt boyling up, and as it were rarified, deſire a very large ſpace: wherefore the Fermentation of Wine or Beer, is begun in open large Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels: but when they grow leſs hot, thoſe kind of Liquors, leſt the Particles being ſet and moved into motion, too much, ſhould fly away from the Subject, they are kept beſt, either in a cold Cellar, or cloſe Veſſels. In the preparation of Vinegar, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the contrary, to wit, it is wont to be placed in a hot place near the Chimney or Oven, or expoſed to the Suns beams: to the end that the vinous Spirit being depreſſed, the Saline part might be exalted into a Flux, and ſo might give a ſharpneſs to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. There is another obſervation, that Liquors do Ferment better in wooden Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, than in Glaſs, or Stone: For by long infuſion, ſome Saline little Bodies are got forth of the Wood, eſpecially the Oaken, which promote Fermentation.</p>
                     <p>As to the third thing propoſed, concerning this thing; although to ſpeak properly, the motion of Fermentation, is only a carrying forth of the Principles confuſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, from a ſtate of Crudity towards maturity; and the end of it, is a tendency to the perfection of every thing: yet uſe or cuſtom hath obtained, that this word is attributed to very many other motions of Natural things, and includes other ends, and effects, far different. Therefore when the Fermentative Particles in any Body,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:152521:17"/>
are greatly in motion, the alterations which follow thereupon, may be in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect referred to theſe three Claſſes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it either reſpects the exaltation, and perfection of the parts of the ſame Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; or the reſolution, and corruption of them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Or the diſſolution of the parts of another Body is intended; or the praecipitation of thoſe looſened.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By the motion and action of theſe kind of Principles, a coagulation, and alſo a congelation, now of the ſame Parts, now of different Bodies, are induced. It remains, that we briefly run through every one of theſe Species of Natural Motions, and ways or manners of Fermentation.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of Fermentation, as it is ſeen in the exaltation of Bodies, and tendency to Perfection.</head>
                     <p>THE Exaltation of the parts, is perceived beſt in Works, or in all things appointed for human uſe, foraſmuch as they get a greater perfection and vigor, by Fermentation; as, chiefly Aliments and Medicines do: in many of theſe, we endeavour to carry forth the Spirituous Particles above the reſt; and ſo to procure in the mixture, a grateful ſweet taſt, and other agreeable qualities; as we may obſerve in Bread, Beer, Wine, Cider, and many others: But in ſome, we ſtrive to exalt the Saline part, the Spirit being ſomwhat depreſſed; as in Vinegar, Meath, Broths, alſo in Sauce, Pickle, or in Preſerved things, which are made of Salt and ſharp Liquors. We rarely on purpoſe carry forth the Sulphureous part above the reſt, for from thence a ſtinking ſmell, and ingrateful rammiſhneſs, are wont to happen to eatable things. Among foods ſet apart for mans uſe, Bread, Beer, Wine, and Cider, have the firſt place; which owe moſtly, whatever they have of virtue, or ſtrength, to Fermentation.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the making of Bread, theſe things are chiefly to be obſerved: the Meal of Wheat, or Barly, or of any other Grain, being kneaded with common-water, is reduced to a maſs, to be afterwards baked in an Oven. If there be nothing elſe added to this, it becomes forthwith heavy, and ponderous like Clay, clammy, and of an ingrateful taſt, and of difficult digeſtion: but if in the kneading it, there be added a Ferment, the Maſs preſently grows hot, the bulk ſwells, and afterward being baked, it is made light, ſpongy, of good digeſtion and grateful to the taſt. If you deſire to know the reaſon of the difference, it is this. The meat of the Grain is imbued with a moderate proportion of Spirits, alſo of Salt, and Sulphur; but the Particles of theſe, are overwhelmed in the Maſs, with a viſcous humidity, being kneaded with water; ſo that they move not themſelves mutually, nor are in motion: wherefore in the baking, ſome ſuperfluous humidity evaporates; what remains is cleaving, viſcous, and becomes preſſed cloſe like Clay, and ponderous. But when a Ferment is min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with the Mealy Maſs, the active Particles of the Ferment being firſt ſtir'd up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to motion, take hold of their Companions in the Mealy Maſs, and carry them with them into motion. By this means, whilſt ſome move others, they ſhortly are all ſtirred up into Fermentation; tumultuating here and there, they compaſs and run through the whole Paſt or Dough, they ſubtiliſe and attenuate the clammy and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene parts, and they lift up the maſs, with the motion, and make it hollow, with little holes; which yet in the mean time, leſt it become too ſpungy, and whereby the parts made hollow, and attenuated might more exactly be mixed, it is wrought with long kneading, then afterwards, before the Fermentation ceaſes, and before the hollowed parts ſink cloſe down, it is baked in the Oven. In the baking, the ſuperfluous moiſture evaporates, and moreover, very many Particles of Spirit, Salt, and Sulphur, fly away; wherefore, the maſs becomes lighter, and leſs ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in the mean time, thoſe which remain in the Bread, being much exalted,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:152521:18"/>
and brought to maturity, cauſe in it a laudable conſiſtency, with a grateful ſmell, and taſt.</p>
                     <p>The Ferment commonly uſed, is a portion of the Mealy Maſs, and unbaked, which is kept, being imbued with Salt, to a ſowrneſs (it is called in French <hi>Levain,</hi> becauſe it lifts up the Maſs) or the flowring of Beer, or Ale, called Yeſt or Barm; or for want of theſe the lees or dregs of Beer, or beaten Eggs, are made uſe of. In the mealy Ferment, the Saline Particles having gotten a Flux, do chiefly predominate; as alſo in the faeces of Beer: wherefore the Bread Fermented by theſe, is made harſh and ſomwhat ſowr: In the mean time, Yeſt being very big with Spirit, Ferments the Bread more potently, and brings to the Maſs lightneſs, and a very grateful ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Beaten Eggs abound with Spirit and a Volatile Salt, and do yet more cauſe the Bread to Ferment, and render it more Spongy: without doubt there may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinds of Ferments uſed; for whatever are big and turgid with Spirit, or abound with Salt carried out to a Flux, ſeem to be fit enough for this uſe.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes the mealy Maſs is kneaded with Sulphureous matter, as Butter, Sewet, Fat, or ſuch like, which being baked in an Oven, while it is hot, it is ſeen to be light and ſpongy, (to wit while the Sulphureous Particles, are kept in motion by the heat contracted in the Oven) afterwards, when this Maſs grows cold, it becomes heavy, weighty, and very cloſe: to wit, the aſcititious heat being exhaled, the Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Particles, before carried forth, at length ſink down; and when the Particles of the reſt, not being excited into motion, the Maſs therefore becomes as it were Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentated: For in theſe kind of Subjects the Sulphureous Particles, becauſe they are very viſcous, hinder the motion of the reſt, nor can they themſelves perſiſt in motion, longer than they are forced, by the actual heat.</p>
                     <p>Bread is ſomtimes made of the flower of Wheat, or Barly, that is Germinated or Maulted, which without any Ferment added to it, becomes ſo exceeding hot, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be contained in a compacted maſs, but that in the baking it ſpreads abroad: the reaſon of which is, in ſuch Flower, by the Maulting it, the active Principles are before placed in their vigor, and exaltation; wherefore in the kneaded Maſs, when they are urged, by the heat of the Oven, they run forth inordinately, and force the more thick parts, hindring them, and as it were fling them down head-long. We have ſaid enough of making Bread; we will now paſs to Beer.</p>
                     <p>Beer is made of Mault or Barly, germinated and dryed, which is performed after this manner: Firſt, the Barly is put into common water for three days, that it may intumifie or ſwell, then (the water being let out from it) it is flung in a heap upon a dry floor, moving it twice or thrice a day, leſt it grow too hot, until it begins to germinate, or bud forth, or put out little ſhoots of Roots. Afterwards, by frequent caſting it about, it is hindred from germinating or ſpringing forth any farther, and laſtly, being lay'd upon a Kiln, it is made dry by roſting it; by this means, it yields a meat wonderfully ſweet.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of this kind of proceſs is this; the Barly is permitted to ſpring forth, that its active Principles might be brought or ſet into their ſtrength, or exaltation: for when it germinates, the Spirit, Salt, and Sulphur, at firſt aſleep, and ſluggiſh, do ſwell up or grow big together, and their ſluggiſhneſs being caſt off, they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to exerciſe their powers. The other preparations, hinder the Barly from ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating further, leſt that its Principles being very much looſned, ſhould exhale too much, and fly away from the Subject. The Meal of the Barly thus prepared grows ſweet, becauſe the active Principles are ſet in exaltation like Fruit brought to a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity: wherefore alſo the Liquor impregnated with this Meal, grows very turgid or big with Spirituous and Fermentative Particles; when the ſimple decoction of Barly, ſcarce Ferments at all, nor is kept long, but that it becomes muſty, and inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid.</p>
                     <p>But Beer is made after this manner; upon the Meal of the Barly, prepared as above ſaid, boyled water is poured, and is ſuffered to be macerated, or maſhed, for ſome hours, that it may be ſufficiently impregnated with the active Particles of the ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating Barly, now placed in their vigour: This Liquor being ſatisfied or filled, is drawn off clear from its ſetling, and is laſtly boyled, that it might get a ſomthing more thick conſiſtency, and be able to be kept the longer: Then, when it is ſomwhat cold, it is Fermented, a Ferment, or the flowring of Beer or Yeſt, being put thereto, and ſo tun'd up in a Barrel. Concerning its Fermentation, theſe things are eſpecial worthy of obſervation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:152521:18"/>If it macerate with, or ſtand too long on, the Maulted Meal, the Liquor becomes thick and clammy; and afterwards will hardly Ferment or Work at all: the reaſon of this is, becauſe the active Principles, in this work, are of a prompt motion, and move together with them, the earthy Particles; with which, if by a long ſtay, the paſſages and pores of the Liquor are filled; being too full, they are wholly obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and as the contents in the Stomach, ſtuffed to a ſurfeit, ſcarcely Ferment at all.</p>
                     <p>If too hot, or too cold, the Liquor be put into the Barrel; as in the great heat of the Summer, or the cold in the Winter, Fermentation doth not rightly ſucceed: for by too much heat, the Particles are diſſipated one from another, that they cannot, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually take hold of one another, and ſo work; by too much cold, they are bound up and fixed, that they ſcarce enter into motion, neither perform it ſtrongly.</p>
                     <p>When the Liquor of the Beer Ferments in the Vat, the active Principles do on every ſide explicate themſelves, they precipitate in the bottom the more thick, and Earthy, being partly driven as it were into flight, and partly ſticking to them, they lead them as it were Captive to the top, and there make hollow bubbles continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally growing up, and bring them as it were to ſervitude. After a due Fermentation, the whole ſpace of the Liquor is rendered clear and without dregs, in which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits with a little Salt and Sulphur, do abound; in the mean time, in the ſettlement or dregs, a little of Spirit and Sulphur, with a greater plenty of Salt and Earth remains. So long as theſe ſhall be in their places the Liquor will be clear, ſweet, and Spirituous, but if long kept, or not ſhut up cloſely in a Barrel, great part of the Spirits will fly away: in the mean time, by the defect of theſe, the Saline Particles being exalted, and having gotten a Flux, impregnate the whole Liquor, and make it ſowr; for when Beer, as alſo Wine, goes into Vineger, it doth not happen becauſe they are wholly deprived of Spirits, (for ſo they would degenerate into a taſtleſs thing) but becauſe the Tartareous or Saline parts, are carried forth to a Flux, and infect the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor with their ſharpneſs; in the mean time, the Spirits being leſs in power, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, that they cannot reſiſt them. Very hot weather, Thunder, the noiſe of great Guns, or the tunning it in the open Air, ſuddenly makes Beer grow ſowr, for by theſe means the Spirits being diſturbed in their equal motion, are diſſipated; and in the mean time, the Saline or Tartarous parts, being before ſeparated, and depreſſed, are moved, and carried forth into a Flux.</p>
                     <p>Indeed it plainly appears that the Spirituous parts in Vinegar, are not wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, but ſuppreſſed only whilſt the Saline are placed in a Flux; becauſe from Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, may be Diſtilled, a Liquor exceeding hot and burning, like the Spirit of Wine, after this manner: With the Diſtilled Vinegar, a Salt is extracted from Minium, or Lead Calcined, of which you have plenty, and ſhall diſtil it in a Retort, the Vinous and burning Spirit is driven into the Receiver; the reaſon of which is, becauſe when the Saline Particles of the Vinegar are united with the Salt of the Lead, the Vinous Spirits yet remaining are then freed; and having obtained their own right, they are urged from their lurking places by the heat of the Fire: but thoſe Spirits are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the Lead, becauſe if you give thereto a more vehement Fire, the Salt of the Lead, will be melted into a Metal.</p>
                     <p>But we will return to Beer, from whence we have digreſſed; to which, how great a perfection happens, by Fermentation, appears by this experiment. If you take Beer new made, not yet purged by Fermentation, and place it to be Diſtilled in a Bladder or Cucurbit; only a vapid or taſtleſs water aſcends, without any Spirits, and ſtrength at all: but if you proceed after the ſame manner with Beer truly Fermented, you will have a hot water, and highly Spirituous. And this takes away the objection of ſome, who ſay that water being even impregnated with the Meal of Mault, ſhould not be any more boyled, leſt the Spirits ſhould exhale; becauſe the Spirits, before Fermentation, are ſo obvolved with the more thick Particles of the reſt, that they cannot break forth from the Concrete.</p>
                     <p>The more the Beer is impregnated by the Mault, the ſtronger it is, keeps the longer without ſowring; which is helpt if Hops be boyled therein, from which at firſt it grows bitter, but afterwards recovers a grateful ſweetneſs; the reaſon of this is becauſe the pores of Liquor, which are empty of the Particles of the Meal, when they are poſſeſſed by thoſe of the Hops, the conſiſtency is made more compact, and is more full of Fermentative Particles; wherefore there is not quickly given any room for the Flux of the Salt. But that the Liquor being at firſt bitter, afterwards grows ſweet,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:152521:19"/>
happens for this reaſon; becauſe the Spirituous and Sulphureous parts, ſupplyed by the Meal of the Mault, come not ſo ſoon to Maturity, becauſe of the others mixed with them from the hops being boyled therein: but when this happens, that they grow to maturity, they eaſily excel all the others, and impart a ſweetneſs to the whole. Not only Hops being boyled in Beer, keep it long from ſowring, but alſo many other bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or ſharp things, do the ſame: for theſe, foraſmuch as they exceed in a Volatile Salt, hinder the flowings of other Salt; wherefore, ſome are wont to put into the Barrel, a piece of Saſſafraſs Wood, the tops of Wormwood, Broom, the Firr-Tree, the rinds of Oringes, alſo Spices in a ſmall quantity; by which means, the Drink, tho of a ſmaller ſubſtance, is kept a long while from ſowring. Thus much concerning the preparation of Beer, on the conſideration of which, (as alſo of Bread) we have ſtayed long, becauſe the word Fermentation is chiefly due to theſe. Let us paſs next to Wines.</p>
                     <p>Excepting the Blood of Animals, there are no Liquors that grow hot, like Wines; there is found in none a greater plenty of Spirits, Salt, and Sulphur, or a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable turgeſcency, or ſwelling up. The Fermentation of Wines, and the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them Fermenting, are wont to be taught among the Vintners or Wine-Coopers, as a ſecret only to their Apprentices, or the Adepti of their Art. Among them there is delivered a certain Phyſical Science, or Method of Medicine, by which means, the impurities of Wines are purged forth, their heats attempered, or alſo their defect, or ſickneſs may be healed. There are many ways to be uſed, beſides that of ſophiſticating, as a ſecret, by which depauperated and taſtleſs Wines are ſold for ſound and rich. But as to our propoſition, that the Doctrine of Fermentation might be illuſtrated, theſe three things ought chiefly to be conſidered, concerning Wines: Firſt, Their defaecation or cleaning, and their going into parts. Secondly, Their immoderate efferveſcency or growing hot, from what cauſes it is wont to be ſtirred up, and by what means to be ſuppreſſed. Thirdly, The declination of them, when they grow worſe: and by what remedies they are kept that they do not quickly paſs into a taſtleſneſs or Vinegar.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to Firſt, That Fermentation may begin in the Muſt, there is not (as in Beer) required, the putting to any Ferment, for the Juice being expreſſed from the Grapes, doth ſo greatly ſwell up with active Particles or Principles, that it preſently of its own accord, grows remarkably hot: but it is a uſual thing in ſome regions, when the Grapes are trod, to beſprinkle them with Quick Lime, by the provoking of which, as a Ferment, the Liquor preſſed forth, grows more fervent, and is ſooner purged. The Muſt or new Wine, is at firſt put into open Tubs, for that they cannot be contained in cloſe Veſſels, for their great heat or working, which ſo boyls up, that water over a Fire grows not more hot: when the Wine is a little cooler it is put into more cloſe Veſſels, in which it is further purged by Fermenting. In the purifying, the Spirituous and Subtile Particles greatly ſhake the more thick dregs, and diſmiſs them from themſelves on every ſide, that the Maſs of the Vinous Liquor, being made free from the mixture of the dregs, is rendred clear and without dregs. The Faeces or Lees of the Wine conſiſt of Salt and Sulphur, with a little Spirit and plenty of Earth; which whilſt the Wines grow hot, being ſeparated by degrees, either by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulating themſelves mutually, are affixed to the ſides of the Veſſels under the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Tartar, or like Lees or Mother, ſettle to the bottom. In the mean time the Liquor ſwimming over them, is very clear and exceeding Spirituous.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes the defecation or clearing of Wines is hardly brought about, as a Vinous Liquor is not eaſily freed from the mixture of Tartar: wherefore Vintners are wont to put to the Wines ſome Bodies that either clear them, or precipitate them, ſo as the Earthy matter ſwimming in them, may ſooner ſettle to the bottom: The things which ſo clarifie Wines are of two ſorts: for they have either viſcous parts, as Glew, the Whites of Eggs and ſuch like, which ſtick cloſe to the faeculencies of the Wine with laying faſt hold on them, and carry them with themſelves towards the bottom: Or elſe they abound in a precipitatory ſtrength, which while they enter into the pores of the Liquor, thruſt forth the more thick Particles from thence, and ſtrike them down to the bottom; as are the duſt of Alabaſter, Calcined Flints, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Wines tho at firſt they were well cleared, yet afterwards they conceive immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate efferveſcencies, ſo that the Tartar, being ſtirred up from the bottom, it at length mingled with them; alſo the Spirits being looſened, now the Sulphureous Particles, now the Saline being too much carried forth, render the Wines unſavory, clammy
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:152521:19"/>
or ſowr. We will conſider theſe things, from what Cauſes they come to be ſo, and by what means they are Cured.</p>
                     <p>Wines very often contract heats, when they are full of Tartar or too rich Lees: For Tartar or Lees, tho ſeparated from the Liquor of the Wine, and depreſſed to the bottom of the Veſſel, yet for that they conſiſt of plenty of Salt and Sulphur, they ſtill ſend from themſelves Fermentative Particles, by the inſpiration of which the Wine is kept in an equal motion of Fermentation: and as the Wines are leaſurely ripened, ſo the Salt and Sulphur which lurk in the Tartar, are by little and little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted; until at length, being carried forth to a Flux, they infect the Vinous Liquor, with a troubled feces or dregs, and compel it to grow immoderately hot, and to boil up. Againſt theſe too great heats of Wines, there is a neceſſity, that they be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently drawn off or rack'd, from this too rich Lees, and put into another Veſſel, or elſe it comes to paſs, by reaſon of its too great diſturbance, the Sulphur being very much exalted, that they become unſavory and ropy; or the Spirit being loſt, and the Salt carried forth to a Flux, they contract a ſowrneſs, and turn to Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth Wine grow more hot than it ſhould do, only from Tartar, or too rich Lees, but by too great agitation, immoderate heat, or by an extraneous or ſtrange Body put to it, and not miſcible, or that cannot mingle with it: for by theſe and other ways, the Sulphureous part of the Wine grows hot, and from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a fervour, and undue boyling up; for the ſetling of which, beſides the racking or drawing it off, from one Veſſel into another, they uſe to pour plenty of Milk, into the Pipe or Barrel, by whoſe mixture the heats and tumults of the Wines are preſently appeaſed; but as by this means the Spirits of the Wine are very much overcome, it cannot keep long, but ſoon after degenerates to Vinegar, or without taſt; therefore the Vintners are neceſſitated to ſell preſently the Wines mended by this Artifice, and very ſuddenly to draw them off.</p>
                     <p>Theſe kind of heats of Wines, tho they be timely appeaſed, before they wholly ſpoyl the Wines, yet they leave ſome viciouſneſs, by which the Vinous Liquor is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from its due colour and conſiſtency, and is made leſs grateful to the Palate: for Wines made hot, oftentimes become of a more deep colour, <hi>viz.</hi> they degenerate from a watery and clear colour, to a Citron or Red, and give to the taſt a rankneſs; all which indeed proceed, from the Sulphur being too much carried forth and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: For theſe kind of diſtempers of Wines, they proceed after this manner; for the mending the colour, oftentimes ſimple Milk, or boiled with Glew or fine Flour, is poured into the Hogſhead or Pipe; for theſe procure a certain ſeparation of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Sulphur, and with its whiteneſs give a clearneſs, or reſtore the colour to a bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Mucilaginous, clammy, or ropy Wines, are amended by the infuſion of burnt Alum, quick Lime, Gypſum or Plaſter of Walls, Salt and the like; for theſe cauſe a new Fermentation, that the more thick Particles are thruſt forth from the reſt, and precipitated towards the bottom. The unſavouryneſs is helped by the ſame means.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As to the third propoſition; Wines are depauperated or made poor, when by a long efferveſcency the Spirit and more pure Sulphur, being exhaled, the Saline Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles begin to be exalted: in this caſe their languiſhing ſtrength is ſuſtained with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain remedies, as it were Cordials.</p>
                     <p>As the Spirit and Sulphur being too much carried forth, and exalted, is cured by the drawing off the Wines from the rich Lees: So the ſame being depreſſed, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is that they be put to a more rich Tartar or Lees: wherefore the Vintners, are wont to pour the depauperated Wines, deſtitute of plenty of Spirits and Sulphur, and which begin to grow ſowr, by reaſon of the Salts being carried forth to ſound and freſh Lees or Tartar; that they might as it were anew inſpired with Spirit and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, ferment and recover new ſtrength and vigor, beſides they make Syrups of generous and rich Wines, with Sugar and Spices, which they pour among the ſtale and deadiſh Wines. Further, for Wines turning to Vinegar, they are ſaid to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter profitably, ſome other remedies. <hi>Gratarolus</hi> praiſes with many more, Lard and Swines fleſh ſalted, wrapt in Linnen, and put into the Cask: and truly it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Sulphureous odor of this doth reſtrain the Flux of the ſowring Salt; for this end the ſame Author commends Leek-Seed, Pine-Nuts, blanched Wheat, boiled Wine, Aſhes, the ſhavings of Willow, and many others, for the Salt readily acts on theſe kind of Subjects, and ſpends its force; even as Virgins ſick of the Green-ſickneſs,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:152521:20"/>
deſire greedily to eat ſuch like abſurd things, that may ſatisfie the extrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and for the moſt part ſowriſh Ferment of the Ventricle, but very hurtful to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. There remains another kind of Cure, whereby ſmall Wines almoſt corrupted, and growing vapid or ſmachleſs, recover new vigor for a time, to wit, a portion of Rheniſh Wine, or others, very Fermentable, is laid up, and hindred from Ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from whence it is made a perpetual Muſt (commonly called Stum) if a little of this Liquor be poured into a Cask of ſtale Wine, and jogged together, it gives a freſh, and new Fermentation to the whole: ſo that that Wine will froth and boyl, and ſhut in a Glaſs will leap forth; but the drink mended by this Artifice, is accounted very unwholſom, for that it is apt to ſtir up an immoderate Fermentation in our blood: wherefore it is prohibited by Edict, that the Wine-Coopers or Vintners make not uſe of this kind of Sophiſtication.</p>
                     <p>It is a uſual thing alſo, to ſtop up cloſe, in Stone or Glaſs Bottles, for a time, ſmall Wines, and new Ale or Beer, which being afterwards opened, the Liquor ferments ſo impetuouſly, that being almoſt all rarified into froth, it flies forth of the Bottles: which beſides contracts ſuch an acrimony or ſharp cutting, that it can ſcarce be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: The reaſon of which (as it ſeems) is this: The turgency or ſwelling up, and the notable acetoſity, ſharpneſs, or quickneſs of theſe kind of Liquors, proceeds chiefly from the Salt being exalted, and having gotten a Flux; for when as the Liquor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of much Tartar and little Spirit, is ſhut up cloſe in a Veſſel, all the Particles together are forced to be fermented, and when they cannot be ſeparated, and fly away from one another, they do the more trouble one another, and break themſelves into ſmall bits; that by this means the bond of the mixture may be wholly broken; but the little bodies looſened one from another, and as it were freed by reaſon of the cloſeneſs of the Veſſel, are forced together: wherefore when the Veſſel is opened, all the Particles at once being ready for flight, like Air ſuddenly rarified, break forth with noiſe and tumult; and becauſe the Saline parts having gotten a Flux, by reaſon of the plenty of Tartar, are ſtronger than the Spirit and Sulphur, from thence the nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cutting ſharpneſs is cauſed in the Liquor.</p>
                     <p>Cyder comes next to the Nature of Wine, to wit, of the ſmaller ſort, which kind of Liquor, is only the Juice preſſed from Apples, and brought to maturity by Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation: concerning this kind of Drink, it is worth obſervation, that if it be made of Summer Fruit, or too much ripened, it will not keep in ſtrength, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently degenerates into a deadneſs: but if it be prepared of very unripe, and ſowr Apples, it contracts a bitterneſs, for that the Spirits do not ſufficiently ariſe in this, but give place to the Salt, having firſt gotten a Flux: but in the other, they are not long enough retained, but wholly fly away, before the maſs of the Liquor attains to full Fermentation: but there are Fruits and Apples, exceeding fit for this buſineſs, which being indued with a more firm conſiſtency, are not quickly corrupted, neither do they attain their perfect maturity or ſoftneſs, but of a long time: The Juice of theſe wrung forth, and put into a Cask, does not grow hot, as Beer, with a great frothy head, but after the manner of Wines, with a noiſe, like a Pot boyling over the Fire: whilſt Fermenting after this manner, it is made clear, the more light recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are carried upwards, and remain in the Superficies, as the flowering: but the more thick parts and Tartarous ſettle plentifully in the bottom; but the more ſolid Cruſt, or Coagulated Tartar, is not fixed to the ſides of the Veſſel: which is a ſign Cyder is a more wholſom Drink, nor ſo infeſtous to the nervous ſtock, becauſe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds leſs with a ſharp Salt than ſmall Wines. The Liquor ſwimming over theſe Faeces or Lees ſettling in the bottom, enjoys it as it were its food, and is kept by its inſpiration in ſtrength; from which, if it chance to be drawn forth, it quickly grows ſowr: for indeed this kind of Drink, is in great danger to be deſtroyed by the Flux, or ſowrneſs of the Salt: againſt this ill, to preſerve it, ſome are wont to caſt into the Cask Muſtard Seed bruiſed, or Muſtard Balls, for that the Volatile Salt of this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Flux of the acetous Salt, ſo that the Liquor thereby preſently grows clear, and keeps the longer: another kind of remedy againſt the ſowrneſs of Cider, is, that as ſoon as it begins to grow ſowr, it be drawn off from its Lees, and kept in cloſe ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Bottles, with a little Sugar; for by this means it ferments anew, and becauſe, together with the Flux of the Salt, the Spirits being carried forth, are deteined from flight, a very grateful ſharpneſs is cauſed to the whole Liquor. Alſo, almoſt by the ſame preparation, and the like proceſs of Fermentation, a potable Liquor is made out of Pears, which is however above meaſure ſweet, and if plentifully drunk, renders the Belly looſe, as if they had taken Phyſick.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:152521:20"/>So much for Fermenting Liquors, whoſe virtue conſiſts in the Spirit being carried forth, and obtaining the height of perfection: there remains other preparations, whoſe vigor is placed in the Saline part being exalted, and having gotten a Flux; among theſe, Vinegar is of chiefeſt note, the way of making of which, being wholly unlike the aforementioned, requires a method of Fermentation, very different from thoſe before deſcribed: for example, ſmall Wines, or more generous or ſtrong Beer, being put up into the Cask, are expoſed in the Summer time, for a long while to the Suns Beams, or elſe in the Winter, they are kept near a Stove in ſome hot place; after this manner, whilſt ſome Spirits evaporate, the reſt being put under the yoak, the Saline parts are exalted and infect the whole Maſs of the Liquor with their ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: but not only Wines long kept, or Stale Beer, out of which the Spirits of their own accord, begin to go away, but freſh Muſt, or new Beer, paſs after this manner into Vinegar; for the Country-women are wont to place without doors all the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſtrong Ale, and highly impregnated with Mault, in a Cask, by which means they make an exceeding biting and moſt penetrating Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>Yea after the ſame manner almoſt, our kind of Hydromels, Honnied Drink, or Meath are wont to be prepared: to wit, they boyl ſixteen parts of Water with one part of Hony, to the conſumption of a third part, adding then ſome Spices, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a ſharp Ferment, they place the Cask and Liquor for many days in the Sun, and afterwards in a Wine-Cellar. It ſeems the Sunning of it is uſed, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Saline parts being brought towards a Flux, might ſomwhat reſtrain the nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſweetneſs of the Hony: and by that means the ſweet being tempered with ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a moſt pleaſing taſt is afforded to this Drink.</p>
                     <p>By reaſon of the ſharpneſs ariſing from the Flux of the Salt, alſo very many eatable things are wont to be prepared after various manners; hence the fleſh of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and eſpecially of Fiſhes when they ſwell with too much Sulphur, are pickled with Salt Brine or ſharp Liquors, that the Salt being brought forth, they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more grateful to the Stomach. It would be a tedious buſineſs to inſiſt here on particulars; but I will in this place deſcribe a certain noted kind of Oaten Broth, Grewel, or Flumery, which profitably nouriſhes Feveriſh, alſo Conſumptive and Hectick people.</p>
                     <p>This kind of Drink, that it may become gratefully ſowriſh, the Meal of Oats is put into common water for about three days, till it acquire a ſomwhat ſowr taſt: then, this infuſion is placed upon the fire, and with a Ladle is ſtirred about until it boyls, and when it riſes up ready to flow over the Veſſel, it muſt then be poured forth into a platter, and preſently cooled; it will appear like Gelly, and may be cut into bits; which if heated ſoon melts. In this preparation may be obſerved, that by a long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Grain, the Saline parts being brought forth, do get a Flux; then theſe ſo impregnate the Liquor that the more thick Particles being by the heat brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its pores and paſſages, they are ſo ſtrictly ſhut up, that they cannot eaſily ſink down, but that the whole mixture becomes like Gelly.</p>
                     <p>It would alſo be too great labour to heap together here, the various Condites and kinds of Pickles, for it would be to deſcribe under that rank the whole Art of Cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Diet. For in both the only aim is, that for healths ſake and for pleaſure, the active Particles in our food, may be placed in their vigor and exaltation; for ſo they greatly pleaſe the Palate, and by a more eaſie digeſtion go into nouriſhment: for this reaſon, not only Drinks, and Confections of Corn, and Herbs of a diverſe nature and kind are thought on; but alſo we variouſly prepare fleſh, both boyled and roſted, and add to them ſauces, that the Particles, now the Spiritous, now the Saline, being carried forth to a Flux, might pleaſe the taſt, with a certain ſharpneſs. Thoſe which are of a more fixed nature, are brought to exaltation, by Sauces made of Sugar, Salt, or Pepper. They are wont to keep ſome fleſh almoſt to putrefaction, that by that means, the active Particles being placed in their ſtrength and motion, may become of a more grateful taſt. Here might be interwoven, a long diſcourſe concerning Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Compoſitions, but becauſe this ſubject, deſerves a peculiar conſideration, I will ſay nothing more of it here. Let us next ſee by what motion of Fermentation and Habitude of Principles, Natural Bodies tend towards diſſolution; or what is the progreſs of every thing to Putrefaction and Corruption.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the motion of Fermentation, which is obſerved in the Death, alſo in the Putrefaction and Corruption of Bodies.</head>
                     <p>NAtural Bodies in which Spirit, Salt, and Sulphur, are found in but a mean quantity, do not ſtay long in the ſame ſtate: for theſe active Principles are employed perpetually in motion: As ſoon as they come together, they tend from Crudity and Confuſion towards Perfection, for the ſake of which, when they have reach'd the height, they are able to come to, they are not quiet in this point; but from thence they make haſt towards the diſſolution of that thing. Thoſe which are more volatile do firſt of all break forth from the looſened bond of the mixture; then the reſt ſeparate into parts, until the form of the mixture wholly periſhes: The Spirit being carried forth to the top, flies away firſt with the water, and the more pure Sulphur, and by its expiration, diffuſes a very grateful odor; afterwards the more thick Sulphur, with the Salt, being looſened from the band wherewith they were tyed, and having gotten a Flux, by degrees evaporate, and together diſperſe a very ſtinking ſmell: together with theſe, the watery parts flow forth, and the frame of the ſubject breaks, or falls down into Earth or a <hi>Caput Mortuum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This kind of proceſs may be obſerved both in natural things, and alſo in Subjects prepared by Art: Concerning Natural things, the disjunction of the Elements, and their ſeparation into parts, may be ſeen both in the death of living Bodies, or the extinction of life and vegetation; and alſo in the corruption of them being dead, and in their reduction to a rottenneſs.</p>
                     <p>As in Vegetables, the growth and maturity depend on the combination and mutual cleaving together of the Principles, ſo the decay and death depend on their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſunder, and ſeparation, in Plants and Fruits; being by degrees exalted from a crude and ſowr Juice by Spirit and Sulphur, they come to maturity; to which a ſweet taſt and ſmell, and a pleaſant colour happen: then preſently the ſame matter, the Spirit and Sulphur, and the reſt of the Elements leiſurely flying away from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is ſoon reduced to a filthineſs and rottenneſs: If after the ſubtil and more pure Particles of Spirits and Sulphur are flown away, there ſtill remain plenty of Earth and Salt, with ſome Sulphur, the matter does not putrifie, but grows dry with an hoarineſs: but if the thick Salt and Sulphur, having gotten a Flux, break forth from the Subject, together with the reſt, the bond of the mixture being looſened, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the external humidity, poſſeſſes the ſpaces left by theſe, and the Body is reſolved into rottenneſs.</p>
                     <p>Alſo all Animals whatſoever, have ſet bounds of their growth and duration: For they aſcend from their beginning, by ſlow increaſe, to motion and ſenſation; then to the ſtrength and exaltation of Nature: in which point they ſtay not, but from thence, by equal ſteps, make haſt towards their fall.</p>
                     <p>If the cauſe of this kind of limitation be required, we ſay that Mother Nature hath placed in the primigenious ſeed of every thing, ſuch a ſtock of Spirit, Salt and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, which might ſuffice for the producing the utmoſt thrids or lineaments of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: ſo that the growth and aſcent of the thing, to its height or <hi>acme</hi> is only an evolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or unrowling of that radical matter, and protenſion or ſtretching it ſelf forth into a greater dimenſion; in the mean time the little ſpaces and vacuities, which are made by the protraction of this matter, are filled up by the active Particles, ſupplyed by Nutrition, which alſo by a continual ſeries of motion are ripened, exhaled, and give place to others ſucceeding. As ſoon as this ſeminal matter is unfolded and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to the height, that it cannot be moved, or expanded further, the matter is then brought to the ſtate of its perfection: from thence ſome Particles of this Radical ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, together with the ſecondary ſupplyed from the Nouriſhment, begin to evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; and others dayly, and then others, being after this manner conſumed, both
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:152521:21"/>
the ſolid parts, by degrees decreaſe in their ſubſtance, as alſo the Nutritious Juice and Blood, even decline for the worſe, till by a long waſting, the props of the Body, are made dry or withered, and the blood ſo depauperated, that it will not ſuffice for ſuſtenance to the vital fire: juſt as it may be perceived in a Lamp, if the Oyl being continually conſumed, in its place be put water, the Liquor is rendered poor, and diluted, that it is not able any longer, to cheriſh at all the flame of the wick.</p>
                     <p>When the Life of Animals periſhes, (either it expires after the aforeſaid manner leiſurely, and like a Candle or Lamp is extinguiſhed, the Oyl or Tallow being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed; or it is choaked by a haſty death, being ſnatched away by Fate, or the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a Diſeaſe) preſently the Spirits, with Salt and Sulphur, flowing together in the blood; and alſo planted in every part, ceaſe from their regular motion, and are moved into confuſion: then they partly exhale from the pores, with the vaniſhing heat, and partly being ſhut up within in the Cavities, inordinately Ferment, with the remaining Particles, and make a ſwelling up of the inwards, and of the whole Body. But afterwards the frame of the ſolid parts being by degrees looſened, and the Sulphureous Particles, together with the Saline, having gotten a Flux, begin to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate; from thence a ſtrong ſtink and corruption ariſe. The active Principles, breaking forth by heaps, do often mutually take hold of one another, and being combined in the ſuperficies of the Carcaſe, produce Worms: at length when they are wholly exhaled from the Subject, what remains falls into duſt.</p>
                     <p>It is a uſual thing for Worms to be generated in Vineger when it is corrupted and loſt its ſtrength, which being exceeding ſmall; and ſomwhat long and ſmooth like Eels, ſwim in the Liquor, and may by the help of Glaſs be expoſed to our Eyes; theſe beeing ſeen, it is commonly ſaid, that the ſharpneſs and pricking of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger proceeds from theſe little Creatures, which is a vain thought that deſerves not a refutation; for they are only to be found in dead Vineger; and I pray from whence have they their teeth ſufficient for the gnawing of Iron? But the whole corroſive force of Vineger is more truly referred to the Salt having gotten a Flux: in the mean time thoſe little Creatures ſeem to be begotten by this means; it is ſufficiently known, that when very many Subjects are brought to putrefaction, the active Principles being thruſt out of doors, yet ſtill affecting their old dwelling, remain ſomwhere about the neighbourhood, and being joyned together, do often produce living Bodies; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when moiſt things putrifie, moſt often little Worms grow on their Superficies; but in Vineger the buſineſs is a little different, to wit, becauſe the Elementary Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are more fixed, therefore when the mixture of the Liquor is wholly diſſolved, the active Principles, although looſened, yet breaking very hardly and difficultly from the ſubſtance, meet together in the bowels of the Subject, and there mutually cheriſhing one another, cauſe thoſe little Creatures in the midſt of the waters.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Bodies of living Creatures, being prepared for our Food, are diſpoſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards putrefaction, if they are put up for ſome days, till the active Particles are looſened, and begin to be in motion, tending to exhalation; wherefore both the Fleſh becomes more flaccid, and in eating more tender and ſoft: and if they are kept longer, till the Saline and Sulphureous parts being carried forth into a Flux, do break out, preſently a ſtinking ſmell and putrefaction is induced.</p>
                     <p>There are many ways whereby fleſh is wont to be kept from putrefaction; the chief of which are, that it be pickled with Salt or Spices. Things are kept a long time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt and very grateful to the taſt, with Salt: Dead Carkaſes are imbued with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they may remain a long while in their Sepulchers. As to the firſt, Brine or ſalt Pickle hinders the eruption of the Sulphur, and fixes it in the Subject by its em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracement, and retains it. Spices, as they conſiſt of very active Principles, ſtir up a new Ferment in the Subject, the dead Carcaſe; and the implanted Elements of this, joyn into the ſociety of their motion, and retain many of their Particles flying away, yet longer in the Body: As Salt and Spices are made uſe of for the preſerving long fleſh, and Sulphureous things, (which alſo preſerve all other things from Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction) ſo Vegetables, and their Flowers and Fruits are better conſerved with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar: for this by cheriſhing the active Particles of the Subject, reſtrains them within, and beſides, renders the Confections, of a very grateful taſt.</p>
                     <p>Minerals, chiefly the ſolid and hard, becauſe they are indued with plenty of Salt and Earth, with little of Sulphur, and with a leſs quantity of Spirits, therefore they rarely, or not at all conceive Putrefaction: there is the ſame reaſon for reſinous things, which tho they abound in Sulphur, with Salt and Earth, yet becauſe there is but a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:152521:22"/>
ſmall portion of Water and Spirits, therefore their frame is not eaſily looſened, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they obnoxious to Putrefaction. Among Minerals, Common-water only, falls under this rank: for this, if it ſtand ſtill, or is kept long in a Veſſel, its Salt and Sulphur, though but in a little quantity, having gotten a Flux, begin to evaporate, and together to induce Putrefaction: but ſo long as water is in motion, theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are ſtill involved with others, and ſo by their mutual embrace, are detained from evaporation.</p>
                     <p>Artificial things and preparations, are no leſs ſubject to Putrefaction than Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things; for Bread, and all manner of Eatable things or Food, Wine, Beer, and other Drinkable Liquors, alſo Medicinal Confections, being long kept, firſt loſe their ſtrength and vigor, and then afterwards are Corrupted: concerning which, we may obſerve theſe following things.</p>
                     <p>The more the things are Compounded, and have all the Principles conjoyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the ſooner, and the eaſier, do they enter into Putrefaction; wherefore Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things, prepared of Fleſh, Broths, Decoctions of Herbs, alſo many Medicines made after the Galenical way, are wont (unleſs preſerved with very much Salt or Sugar) to be Corrupted in a ſhort time: In the mean time, Diſtillations, and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Preparations, which conſiſt of Homogeneous, or not much different Particles, are kept ſound a long while.</p>
                     <p>In Compounded things, if there be too great quantity of water, things ſooner putrefie, for ſo the frame of the mixture is too looſe; ſo that the fixed Principles cannot take hold of the Volatile, or keep them back from flight: but thoſe in which Spirits abound with moderate Salt and Sulphur, if they are kept in a cloſe Veſſel, that they may evaporate but little, continue a long time, as may be perceived by ſtrong or generous Wine. The next to theſe, are thoſe things which are preſerved with Hony or Sugar, or in which the Saline Particles are in great plenty by Nature.</p>
                     <p>Many of theſe, whilſt they are corrupted, are either made Moldy or Rank, or they grow ſowr, or degenerate into a vapidneſs, or without taſt: things are made Moldy, when the ſubtil Particles in the exhaling, are deteined by the more thick, and cleaving together by their mutual embrace on the Superficies of the Body, grow into a ſoft Down or Hoarineſs, even as Moſs is brought forth by Stones or Wood expoſed to moiſture.</p>
                     <p>Rankneſs or unſavory Taſt, happens chiefly in Sulphureous things, for Oyly and Fat things, by Heat or Age, become Muſty or Unſavory, to wit, when the Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very much exhaled, the Sulphureous Particles are two much exalted, and begin to evaporate.</p>
                     <p>Sharpneſs or Acidity is induced from the Salt, being too much carried forth and looſened, for when the Spirit is depreſſed, or exhaled, the Salt being fuſed, conceives a Flux, and ſo brings in a Sowrneſs: hence Wine, Beer, Cydar, alſo Milk, very many Eatable things, and the Juices of Herbs, when they are long kept, or if they are moved by too immoderate heat of the Air, or ſhaking, do eaſily grow Sowr.</p>
                     <p>Liquid things, degenerate into a vapidneſs or taſtleſneſs, when the active Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, are for the moſt part gon forth, and nothing eminent beſides Water and Earth, or of the ſubtile parts, is left in the Subject.</p>
                     <p>That I may contract what is aforeſaid; the corruption of every thing, is only the ſeparation and departure of themſelves from one another into parts of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples before combined, (the bond of the mixture being looſened) which motion, by reaſon of the diverſe diſpoſition of their breaking forth, (either with or without a ſtink) ends in Putrefaction or Rottenneſs.</p>
                     <p>Where Spirits abound, and that there is alſo plenty of Sulphur and Salt, and the Particles being looſened from their bonds, break forth in heaps; the mixture putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies with a ſtink; alſo if it conſiſt of a thick ſubſtance, ſo that all the parts are not rightly ventilated, it conceives a heat from the Putrefaction: in ſuch a Corruption, the ſtink proceeds from the exhalation of the ſharp pointed Sulphur, or made prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Salt: Putrefaction follows, for that the external humidity, enters into the place of the Particles flying away: But the heat is produced by the Sulphureous Particles being moved together in heaps, and being ſhut up within the Subject, that they gather together, and being united act more ſtrongly. But if there be in the Subject a leſſer proportion of Salt and Sulphur, ſo that when the mixture is looſened, the Particles are moved more ſlowly, and evaporate leiſurely, the Body grows dry, and is reduced to a waſting, without any ill ſmell, Putrefaction or Heat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:152521:22"/>It will not be from the purpoſe to inquire in this place, from whence ſome empty Veſſels, and more moiſt bodies, by lying long, conceive a certain ſtink without Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction; alſo other things being put into them, or lying near them, are wont to partake of their Evil; for which affection, a proper Latin word is not eaſily to be met with; in our Idiom it is called Muſtineſs, and in ſome ſort ſeems to be deſigned by the word <hi>Mucor,</hi> unleſs that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or <hi>Mucor,</hi> points at Bodies infected with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Down or Hoarineſs, (which we call Moldineſs) which here never happens. The conſideration of this matter is not improperly referred to the Doctrine of Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for this Tincture or Impreſſion of a ſtink, unfolds it ſelf far abroad, as if it were a certain Ferment, that the Veſſel but lightly imbued with it; infects whatever Liquors are put into it, and infuſions of them, even new and often iterated; we may obſerve a twofold effect of this thing: For ſomtimes the Veſſels being almoſt empty, at firſt vitiated, afterwards infect moſt Liquors, which they by chance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, with a muſty odor: ſomtimes more moiſt compacted, and ſolid things, being kept long, ſomwhat cloſe in a Cellar, contract this vice of their own accord; when in the mean time the contagion is not perceived to be in the place where they were kept; which things either may become muſty, not becauſe they are corrupted, for in moſt Spirit, Salt, and Sulphur, being yet contained, in the bond of mixture, the frame of the matter is kept whole, but the vice only conſiſts in this, that from the Subjects after this manner diſpoſed, <hi>effluvia's</hi> as it were aculeated or ſharpned fall off, and therefore become ungrateful to our ſmell and taſt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that any Veſſel may conceive a muſtineſs, there ſeems to be required in the firſt place, that its inward hollowneſs be large, and its mouth narrow; to wit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a paſſage may lie open to the outward Air, and reſt may be granted to it being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in: for Juggs with broad mouths, alſo Bottles cloſe ſhut, do not eaſily get this fault. Secondly, that beſides the more ample inward hollowneſs, the ſides of the Veſſel be indued with pores, and very ſmall paſſages; for in theſe kind of little ſpaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared with humour, the Air being ſtrictly ſhut up, remains more quiet, and is apt to ſtagnate: Wherefore Glaſs Bottles are not ſo apt to ſuffer this evil as Wooden, or Stone Bottles. Thirdly, that ſome moiſture, tho very little, ſtick about the ſides of the Veſſel, or in its bottom, whereby the Air being entred may be intangled: for if the Bottles be hung up, with their mouth downwards, that all moiſture may drein out, they will never be muſty.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place: when Bodies, without any contagion of a Veſſel, contract a muſtineſs or moldineſs of their own accord, we may obſerve, firſt, that they are of that kind, which conſiſt of Heterogeneous Particles, that is, a mixture of all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements together; becauſe the parts of Vegetables and Animals, and preparations of them, eaſily receive this evil; Minerals for the moſt part remain free from it: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that there be plenty of humidity in the concrete, for the more dry continue a long while without any hurt: Thirdly, that the Bodies be either kept in a heap un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved for a long time, or elſe in ſome cloſe Cupbord, or Cellar, without Air; for ſo Wheat or Grain, in a heap, unleſs it be often moved, as alſo all Eatable things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put up in a cloſe place quickly grow muſty.</p>
                     <p>According to theſe poſitions we conjecture, that muſtineſs is made an affection to a moiſt inanimate Body, from the ambient Air, being admitted within its pores, and being got in there ſtagnating, whereby the Elementary Particles of that mixture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing combined together with thoſe ſent in by the Air, are exalted into the Nature of a Ferment; that they diffuſe themſelves on every ſide with wonderful activity, and their <hi>effluvia's,</hi> as it were ſharpned, ungratefully ſtrike againſt the ſenſories of the taſt and ſmell. When therefore, ſome Subject becomes primarily muſty, a certain portion of the Air placed near, and hindred from ventilation, enters into its pores and paſſages, and there being intangled with a tenacious matter, is wholly ſhut up within the ſubſtance of that Concrete. From the mixture of the ſhut-up Air, the implanted little Bodies of the matter, eſpecially the Sulphureous and Saline, acquire new heads; that afterwards, when they are exactly to be mixed with no other Body, yet very greatly Fermentative, tho intermingled with any other thing, retain their own Nature, and being diffuſed through the large ſubſtance of the matter, infect the whole; to wit, they diſpoſe by that means, the Particles of that new matter, that they being armed with ſharp points, bring in like manner a trouble to our ſenſes: But in the mean time, from the muſtineſs, whether primarily ariſen, or received by Contagion, the mixture of the thing is not diſſolved, nor the Principles diſſipated;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:152521:23"/>
yea thoſe things which are wholly taſtleſs, do ſcarce at any time become muſty: the muſty ſmell depends chiefly on the active Principles, diſpoſed by a peculiar rite, by the involved Air and their <hi>effluvia's;</hi> wherefore, if they almoſt wholly fly away from any Subject, that is rendred almoſt incapable of this affection.</p>
                     <p>There may be obſerved a certain likeneſs between muſtineſs and an Empyreuma, or taſt of fire or burnt-too, for as in this, the Particles of the fire being intangled, and included by a tenacious matter, by their long ſtay there, pervert the implanted little Bodies of Salt and Sulphur, from whence their <hi>effluvia's,</hi> ſtrike our Senſes with an ingrateful ſharpneſs; moreover, being mingled with other things, they affix to them, the diſpoſition of their pravity; ſo in muſtineſs, the Particles of the Air, being obvolved with a viſcous matter, and ſtagnating, they change by their preſence the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line and Sulphureous little Bodies, from their due temper, whereby they being as it were gifted with ſharp prickings, do ſtrike bitterly our ſenſories, and being exceeding Fermentative, diffuſe their Odor to others: the alteration being either way contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, can ſcarce be blotted out, by any mixture with other things, or emendation by Art: The chief means of helping of either, is by placing it in a reciprocal traje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>viz.</hi> Empyreumatical things, or taſting of the fire, are to be a long while ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to a more moiſt Air, whereby the Particles of the Fire may exhale: and muſty things are to be held to the Fire, or put to ſuch things which may ſweeten their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to wit, quick Lime, Sulphur, or Stygian waters, by which the parts of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Air are driven away, and ſo the remaining little Bodies of the mixture are wont to recover their priſtine ſtate; wherefore, if muſty Liquors are diſtilled, the water falling into the Receiver, will be deprived of that ſtink: But the ſmatch of Fire or Empyreuma, is not ſo eaſily mended by this Artifice.</p>
                     <p>So much for Fermentation, and the motion of the Principles, for as much as within the Confines of the ſame Subject, they diſpoſe it, either to maturity and perfection, or towards diſſolution and corruption. It now follows to treat of the motion of the ſame kind of Particles and Principles, for as much as ſome of one Body do act on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of another Body, and by diſſolving the mixture, do wholly draw them forth, and ſend them outward, or by precipitating it cauſe them to go into parts,</p>

                     <p>FOR the Solution of Bodies, there are two great ſolvencies, or Menſtrua, which exiſt from Nature, to wit, Water and Fire: Fire, if it be next and immediately applyed, deſtroys moſt Bodies, drives away the Principles one from another, and as it were diſſipates them into Air, Earth only, with a little Salt, being left behind; if it be mediately applied, it brings away ſome Particles, ſo that in the mean time others remain: After which manner it ſerves chiefly for Diſtillations, and Chymical Operations, and is alſo uſed in the Preparation of neceſſaries for our Food, both about the Boyling and Roſting of Meats. Water does not ſo readily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Bodies, but it draws forth ſome parts from the Subjects, and receives them into its own Boſom, and firmly retains them for various uſes: But as it does not eaſily pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate every Body, but leaves almoſt untouched thoſe which are of a more fixed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, various ways are thought of, whereby the Menſtruum of water is made ſharper, and is rendred fit for the diſſolving of any Bodies whatſoever. For by means of the Bodies, which it ought to diſſolve, and of the parts which it ought to receive in it ſelf, it is armed as it were with ſome Weapons; with which it is able to unlock any Subject, and to poſſeſs now theſe, now thoſe Particles. The Menſtruum of water is ſharpned with Spirit, Salt, or Sulphur: to wit, either with each of theſe, or with more of them joyned together; we will firſt ſpeak of the watery Menſtruum, with the various ſharpning of it, and afterwards of the fiery diſſolvent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:152521:23"/>Common water moſt eaſily diſſolves the more ſimple Bodies, except Sulphur; and hides their Particles, in its pores and paſſages; it readily receives Salts of every kind, and eaſily imbibes Spirits; it looſens the frame of Earth, and cheriſhes its more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der little bodies, in its embrace; but it is hardly mixed with Fat, and Oyly things, and receives not their Particles, but by the coming between of others, but drives them forth to its Superficies, as not miſcible, or thruſts them down to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
                     <p>Water in ſome meaſure enters the more compounded Bodies, whoſe frame is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what looſe; and then receives into its boſom, ſome not ſimple Particles, but reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the nature of the whole mixture: hence moſt Vegetables, alſo parts of living creatures, and ſome Minerals, being put into common water, do impregnate it with a certain virtue; and from moſt Metals, by a long maceration, it takes away ſome ſtrength, though but ſmall. Some Bodies are diſſolved by water, which yet a Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous or Spirituous Menſtrua leave almoſt untouch'd; as the Gums <hi>Tragacanth, Arabic,</hi> &amp;c. alſo Salts and Sugar.</p>
                     <p>The firſt and moſt common way of ſharpning, whereby ſimple water may more eaſily enter the Bodies to be diſſolved, is, that it be furniſhed with fiery Particles, or darts of adventitious heat; for ſo it is driven more deeply with a certain force, into Bodies, and deſtroys ſome thrids, as it were the ſmalleſt mites, in their moſt inward receſſes. Wherefore we are wont to boyl for a long while, the matter to be diſſolved in water, or at leaſt to infuſe it in warm water, by which means, the more tenuious, and certain ſubtil Particles, which reſemble the nature of the Subject, are eaſily drawn forth, and impregnate the water, with the virtue of the whole mixture.</p>
                     <p>So much for the ſimple, or natural <hi>Menſtruum</hi> of water, to wit, for as much as its activity is wont ſomtimes to be promoted, by fire or aſcititious heat. But this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo ſimple, but that it contains in it ſelf ſome Particles of another kind; as may be gathered from its eaſie Putrefaction; for oftentimes it is impregnated with Spirituous, Sulphureous, or Saline breathings, contracted from the Air or Earth; that for the drawing forth the tinctures of very many things, ſomtimes it excels an Artificial <hi>Menſtruum;</hi> for that Acidulous or Spawiſh waters, Mineral waters, Rain water, and <hi>May</hi> Dew, are of frequent uſe among Chymicks, for the remarkable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of diſſolving, with which they are ſtrong. Beſides, 'tis a vulgar obſervation, that ſome waters moſt eaſily diſſolve Sope, and being throughly mixed with the ſame, cauſes in the liquor a great ſpume or froth; ſuch, if they be rubbed between the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, feel ſoft and gentle; but other waters, which being handled with the hands, are more harſh, refuſe the mixture both of Sope and Oyl, and ſo are accounted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable for the waſhing of Cloaths: theſe ſort of waters, if they ſhould be evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in a Glaſs, oftentimes affix a Cruſt to its bottom and ſides; becauſe they are impregnated, more than they ought, with Saline Particles, with which, when the Saline parts reſiding in the Sope combine, the Sulphureous are carried away, and they being excluded the pores, are thruſt forth as not miſcible, to the top of the Liquor. When Fleſh is boyled in theſe waters, it grows very red; which tincture indeed being thence contracted, is a ſign, that thoſe waters are ſomwhat imbued with Vitriol, or ſome other kind of Salt. But we will paſs to Artificial <hi>Menſtruas,</hi> in which the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Liquor is furniſhed with Spirit, Salt, or Sulphur, being gathered apart, or many of them together.</p>
                     <p>The Spirituous <hi>Menſtruum</hi> of water is made, when from a Body ſwelling with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, a clear and limpid water is diſtilled; as from Wine, or ſtrong Beer, or other Bodies truly Fermented, and brought to exaltation: The kind of diſſolvent is hardly to be had ſo ſincere, but it is mixed with the Particles of more pure Sulphur, and ſomtimes of a volatile Salt. The former kind of Liquor is called Spirit of Wine, which being ſubtil, and very penetrating, eaſily enters the Bodies, and parts of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, and alſo of living Creatures, but hardly Minerals, or not at all: it extracts from many things, not any Particles, or reſembling the Nature of the whole mixture, (as common water) but chiefly Spirituous, and Sulphureous, the reſt being almoſt untouched; wherefore, it is wont to be uſed for the reſinous <hi>magiſteria</hi> of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, (which it draws forth almoſt ſincere or without mixture, under the form of Gum or Refine) in the mean time, it is not ſo fit as common water, for the extracts of Plants, which are not ſo indued with Sulphur: from Sulphureous things, as Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoin, Sulphur, Olibanum, Styrax, Amber, and the like, it draws forth excellent Tinctures: It diſſolves the fixed Salts of Herbs, alſo of Pearls and Coral, before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:152521:24"/>
with Vinegar, by a long digeſtion, and receives their Tinctures into it ſelf: it leaves Sugar, and Gums, being diſſolvable in water, almoſt untouch'd. But there is another Spirituous <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> that is ſharpned with a volatile Salt, ſuch is the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor which is diſtilled out of blood, Harts-horn or Soot; it is far ſtronger than the former, and cuts moſt Bodies, except Metals, into parts, and oftimes deſtroys the forms of the whole mixture: yea it moſt excellently diſſolves ſecondarily, the moſt fixed Metal, to wit, Gold, being firſt reduced into a Calx, by its proper <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and reduces it into a Tincture, or potable Liquor.</p>
                     <p>They are accounted Sulphureous <hi>Menſtrua,</hi> which are brought forth of Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bodies, under the form of an Oyl: theſe are prepared, either by diſtillation, ſuch as are chiefly the Oyl of Turpentine, Juniper, and the like; or by expreſſion, ſuch as are wrung forth of Olives, Almonds, and other Fruits, or Seeds of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Things diſtilled are of more efficacy, than preparations by expreſſion; either of them draw forth ſome Particles, from Vegetables, or Animals; by the vertues of which, theſe Oyls being impregnated, they are made fit for Medicinal uſe. Yea they are conveniently enough made uſe of, for the extracting of the Sulphureous Particles of Minerals, which ſomtimes they draw forth ſincere or unmixt: But if Oyl of Turpentine, or Lin-ſeed Oyl, draws forth by diſſolving, the combuſtible part of common Sulphur, in the mean time, the remaining Saline parts, and untouched by the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> grow into Cryſtals; as is obvious to every one, in the preparing the Balſam of Sulphur.</p>
                     <p>Mineral Bodies, in which the bond of Concretion chiefly depends upon Sulphur, as are the Fire-Stone, Antimony, common Brimſtone, and the like, are in ſome ſort diſſolved by a Sulphureous <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> which draws forth of the Body, Particles of the ſame kind, the Saline being almoſt untouched: wherefore Oyl of Turpentine, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> draw forth a Tincture from theſe; in the mean time, Saline <hi>Menſtrua</hi> ſuch as are diſtilled Vinegar, or Stygian waters, profit little for the diſſolving their Bodies: but that theſe, unleſs before Calcined, hardly are touched. But on the contrary, where the frame of the mixture conſiſts of a Saline bond, ſuch as are Iron, Copper and the like, Saline <hi>Menſtrua,</hi> as <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> Spirit of Vitriol, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> receive in the diſſolving, the Particles of the ſame Nature into themſelves, the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous being almoſt untouched. This plainly appears, in the ſolutions of Metals, but chiefly and remarkably in Camphire, which Stygian waters reduce into a Liquor, in form of an Oyl, ſwimming on the <hi>Menſtruum;</hi> to wit, they diſſolve its frame, and receive ſome Saline parts, on which the Concretion depends, into themſelves; in the mean time the Sulphureous being untouched, they are gathered together apart, on the Superficies of the Liquor. There is ſomthing to be wondered at concerning Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: to wit, that its Concretion being very irregular, that Mineral becomes exceeding unlike, not only to other mixtures, but alſo to it ſelf; for it is very lax, nevertheleſs much compacted; it lies open to the leaſt injuries, yet is almoſt impervious to the greateſt, ſo that it may equally number its loſſes, with its Victories: ſome of its Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles lie ſo looſe, that they are brought away by any Oyly <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> or by a common <hi>lixivium</hi> or Lie: others in the mean while do ſo pertinaciouſly ſtick together, that <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> cannot touch them, only <hi>Aqua Regia</hi> being poured upon it can know it; which ſo ſtrongly reſiſts it, that the fume raiſed up from thence, preſently obſcures the whole Room, wherefore there ſeem to be in this, parts wholly of a different Nature, ſome imperfectly mixt, <hi>viz.</hi> Earthy and Sulphureous, which are eaſily looſned by a fit ſolvent; in the mean time others wholly Metallic, perfectly mixt, coming near in ſome ſort to the Nature of Gold it ſelf; which therefore are only to be diſſolved, by a fit <hi>Menſtruum</hi> of Salt.</p>
                     <p>The Saline <hi>Menſtrua</hi> are of divers kinds and natures, <hi>viz.</hi> of Vegetables, Animals, or Minerals. Among Vegetables are eminent, the ſowr juices of Fruits and Herbs, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Vinegars, acid Liquors diſtilled out of ponderous Woods, as Guaiacum, the Oak, and Box; in all which, the Saline Particles having gotten a Flux, either by Art or by Nature, give a notable ſowrneſs: or the Vegetable <hi>Menſtruum</hi> conſiſts of Salts of Tartar, or made by the cineration of Herbs, and diſſolved, which by the Fire are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much whetted, and acquire an acritude; in theſe the Saline Particles are fixed, and in a condition oppoſite to a Flux. To the rank of Animals I refer the Spirit of Urine, Harts-Horn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which although they are impregnated with Spirits, yet they take their chief forces from a Volatile Salt. But the ſtrongeſt Saline <hi>Menſtrua,</hi> are drawn forth of Minerals, ſuch are acetous Liquors, which are moſt ſtrongly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:152521:24"/>
forced by fire, out of the Salts of Nitre, Sea-Salt, Alumn, Chalcarth or Vitriol, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe which are drawn out of Vegetables, as Vinegars, and acid Liquors do beſt of all diſſolve Corals, Pearls, Shells, and Shelly ſubſtances: becauſe in theſe there is great plenty of Alcalizat Salt, with which the fluid Salt, which abounds in thoſe kind of acetous <hi>Menſtrua's,</hi> deſires to be moſt ſtrictly united; wherefore they being applyed to the body to be diſſolved, enter its pores and paſſages, looſen the Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Particles of the Alcalizat Salt, and ſnatch them into their own Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace. Even after the ſame manner, the fluid Salt in a Vegetable <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches the Volatile Salt in the Horns of Animals.</p>
                     <p>Theſe kind of <hi>Menſtrua's</hi> do corrode ſome Mettals towards the Superficies; but do not ſo potently unlock their bodies by diſſolving, as Stygian waters, ſome Sulphureous ſubjects, being before looſened by Calcination, do enter aptly enough, and from thence carry forth Saline Particles. Wherefore, for the Salt of Tinn, Lead, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, Soot, and others, being firſt reduced into a <hi>Calx,</hi> we uſe diſtilled Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
                     <p>The Salts of Tartar, and the fixed Salts of Herbs, although they ſerve for praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, rather than diſſolution, yet becauſe they conſiſt of ſharp, and very penetrating Particles, they are of egregious uſe: For watry <hi>Menſtrua's</hi> are chiefly ſharpned with theſe, for the extracting of the Tinctures of Vegetables. And altho bodies which abound with an alcalizat Salt, as Pearls, Coralls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are left wholly untouched by reaſon of the Homogeneity or agreeableneſs of the parts in either; and that alſo, they but little gnaw, only on the Superficies, being put upon Mettals, and grow together with their Salt, and Sulphur into ruſt; yet Sulphureous bodies they readily enter, ſo they be looſened by the fire, and unlock and pull aſſunder their joyntings or complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; wherefore, for the making of the Milk or <hi>Magiſterium</hi> of Sulphur, the Salt of Tartar moſt excellently conduces.</p>
                     <p>Saline <hi>Menſtrua's</hi> are moſt ſtrong, which are forced by diſtillation out of Minerals, to wit, out of Vitriol, Niter, Sea Salt, Alumn, Arſenick; Acetous Liquors are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled either from theſe ſingle, or from many of them mixed together; which as they are of the higheſt ſharpneſs, like to fire, readily enter moſt bodies, but chiefly Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallic bodies, and ſuch as conſiſt of a Saline bond, and diſſolve them eaſily into moſt ſmall parts. Theſe Liquors are only Saline Particles, which being driven by the force of heat, from the embrace of their Earth, having gotten by that means a Flux, are converted into water: as actual fire chiefly aſſaults Sulphureous bodies, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the body draws to it ſelf the Conſimilary parts; Stygian waters (which are alſo called potential fire) eaſily pull aſſunder bodies, which very much abound with Salt, as Mettals; and break them, inviolable by fire, into moſt minute parts.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Solutions of Minerals, we may obſerve, that their frame is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily deſtroyed, or looſened into parts, as other Concretes of Nature; but for this, moſt ſtrong <hi>Menſtrua's,</hi> and thoſe chiefly Acetous, diſtilled from Salts, are required; the reaſon of which is, for that the Concretion of Minerals, depends moſtly upon great plenty of Salt, binding the reſt of the Particles, as with a bond; wherefore their ſubſtance is more ſolid, more hard, and compact, and only gives place to a Saline <hi>Menſtruum.</hi> When any Mineral, or Mettal is diſſolved, the fluid Particles of the Salt, in the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> moſt eaſily enter the moſt ſtrict Complications, of the fixed Salt in the mixture, and impervious to any other ſolvent, looſen them from their binding, and ſnatch them into their Embraces: after this manner, the Particles of the Salts being united, and dilated by the Liquor, are hidden in the pores and paſſages of the <hi>Menſtruum;</hi> and together with theſe, ſtick, and are alſo ſupped up, by the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> the more pure and minutely divided bodies of Earth or Sulphur, which were in the mixture; in the mean time, the more thick, and more ſtuffed with Earthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are praecipitated to the bottom of the diſſolving Liquor: wherefore Gold and Silver are wholly devoured by the <hi>Menſtruum;</hi> but Iron, Lead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and alſo Metallick recrements, ſend forth from themſelves, in the diſſolving, Heterogeneous Particles, as ſo many offſcourings: when Minerals are broke into parts by this means, the divided Particles, and moſt minutely broken, (ſo long as they equally cohaere with the Parti-of the fluid Salt, which are in the <hi>Menſtruum</hi>) being diſperſed through the Liquor of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and hidden in its pores and paſſages, are ſupped up, and rendred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible. Yea alſo, the humor of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> being taken away, the remaining
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:152521:25"/>
                        <hi>Calx,</hi> which conſiſts of the Particles of a mixt, and fluid Salt, combined together, is diſſolved in any other Liquor: but if after a Metallic ſolution, the fluid Salt be drawn off, from the Particles of the thing ſoluted, or by Calcination, it neither poyſes any Liquor it is put to, with a new adjection of fixed Salt, nor do the little bodies of the thing ſoluted fall through the pores of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> nor are they laſtly ſupped up, by any Liquor added to them.</p>
                     <p>But that among Metals, ſome are corraded by any acetous Liquor; in the mean time others, as Silver and Gold, require a peculiar ſolvent, as it were to be unlocked by an appropriat Key: and what is more wonderful, common <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> which eats Silver, leaves Gold altogether untouch'd: then the ſame Liquor by an addition of <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> is made a proper diſſolvent of Gold, and has no power upon Silver: The reaſon of thoſe may be thus underſtood: Gold and Silver are more compact Metals, very much cleanſed from earthy matter; wherefore they are not broken into parts by any ſolvent, but only by thoſe kind of <hi>Menſtruas,</hi> which conſiſt of a Salt homogeneous or agreeable with them. But as the frame or ſubſtance of Silver depends upon a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolic Salt, and that of Gold, on an Armoniac Salt (or of a more perfect kind, to wit, ſuch as is wont to be moſt ſtrictly complicated with Sulphur) hence <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> ſo long as it is ſtrong with a Vitriolic Virtue, combines with the Salt of the Silver, and therefore unlocks its frame or ſubſtance, but doth not looſen the concretion of Gold, which depends upon an Heterogeneous bond: If that to this <hi>Menſtruum, Sal Armoniac</hi> be added, the power of the Vitriolic Salt is blotted forth, and the Saline darts of the ſolvent are made fit only for the Gold, the Silver being untouched.</p>
                     <p>When Minerals are corroded by acetous <hi>Menſtrua's,</hi> we are not therefore to think, the ſame always to be reſolved into Elementary parts: that the Salt and Sulphur of them, may be had ſincere or unmixt, by this means (altho ſome boaſt, that they are eaſily able to ſhew ſuch Analyſes of Mettals) for that it appears to our obſervation, and frequent experience, that many of theſe are of ſo compact and ſolid a Concretion, that they cannot be broken, but into integral parts: as for example, Gold and Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, after what manner almoſt ſoever handled, when they are reduced into mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Calxes, will at laſt by a ſtrong fire acquire their proper forms: <hi>viz.</hi> the Saline Particles of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> looſen the bond of Concretion, whereby the moſt minute integral parts of the mixture ſtick one to another; but the ſame ſolvent, is not able in all things, to break aſſunder the <hi>Copula</hi> of the firſt mixture, whereby the Elements are mutually bound together: ſo that for the moſt part Metallic Calxes, are only little bodies of the Concrete, broken into moſt ſmall little Globes, being involved by the Saline Particles of the <hi>Menſtruum:</hi> Wherefore, fire being applyed, thoſe corroſive Salts being pulled away from their Embrace, are wholly driven away; then the Metallic lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bits, or duſt, as ſo many little particular Globes being fuſed, by the intenſe heat, coming together into one Maſs by melting, reſume the Species of the Metall: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they who commonly affirm, that the Salts of Minerals for the moſt part, are only the Saline Particles of the ſolvent, conjoyned with the Metall, reduced as it were into fine flower, without doubt ſpeak truth in the preparations of Sol and Mercury, or of Gold and Quickſilver; alſo the Salt or Sugar of Saturn or Lead, is nothing elſe: But that ſweetneſs comes only from the Vinegar; for if in the diſtillation of Vinegar, the joynings of the Veſſels are cloſed with Clay, and Salt, Chaulk and Horſe-Dung, on the Superficies of this, grows together a moſt white Salt, wonderfully ſweet, in every thing like to that Sugar: but from ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> from Iron, Copper, and Silver, are prepared fictitious Vitriols, which are for the moſt part Saline: For that the ſame, by diſtillation, may be forced into acetous Liquors, as the Metallic recrements.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the ſolvence hitherto recited (which, by means of the Particles, which are ſtrong in them, act upon a peculiar and determinate matter) I know that Chymiſts do boaſt wonderful things, of a certain univerſal <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> by whoſe inſpiration every body what ever, may be eaſily reduced to its Principles, or firſt Elements: And tho <hi>Helmont</hi> have bragged, that he had attained to this Secret by his own Labour, and now dayly the Adepti of Chymiſtry, do aſpire to this end; yet the hopes and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of moſt, have failed them in this work, even as in the Philoſophers Stone. There are alſo ſome other famous <hi>Menſtrua's, viz.</hi> The <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> Tartariſated of <hi>Quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citan,</hi> and his Philoſophic Vinegar, which are of noted uſe in the preparing of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; but ſince I know nothing, or any ſtrange thing they have done, in the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bodies, we will paſs them over.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:152521:25"/>So much concerning ſolvent <hi>Menſtrua:</hi> about bodies to be diſſolved, a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion ſhould be inſtituted, whereby indeed their complections may more eaſily be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked, and cut into moſt minute parts: Wherefore the Concrete is now pounded into powder, now cut into little bits, that the way might lye open for the ſolvent, to its moſt inward receſſes. If that the frame of the ſubject be harder, and more ſtrict, that it will not give place, but of a long time, to the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> before the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is begun, there ought to be adminiſtred ſome aperitives, or openers, whereby the concretion may be firſt looſened, and ſomwhat opened: wherefore, the tincture of Steel, is more eaſily extracted, if its filings be ſprinkled with the juice of Limons, or the Spirit of Vitriol: in like manner Harts-Horn, or the ſhavings of Ivory are handled when we would have the decoctions of them quickly made: when formerly I have been very ſolicitous about this thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that I might render the more hard bodies eaſily ſoluble, in any <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and that I had eſpecially tryed many things about Iron; after ſeveral experiments, at length by a certain chance, and almoſt thinking of ſomthing elſe, I found out a preparation, whereby without any Corroſive, or Acid Liquor, by the mediation only of a gentle heat, the body of Iron is opened, that being reduced into powder, gives immediately a tincture, to any Liquor, that neither Salts themſelves, are ſooner diſſolved in common water: By this means, I am wont to prepare ſuddenly, in great quantity, Mineral waters, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly reſemble our <hi>Tunbridg</hi> Spaws; and to render Wine, Beer, Milk, or Whey, with no trouble Chalybeated. By this means, Syrrops, Tinctures, Extracts, or <hi>Magiſteria</hi> out of Steel, are moſt eaſily to be had. Moreover, plainly by the ſame Artifice, Corals, Pearls, Eyes, and Claws of Crabs, and all ſhelly things, are prepared, that their powders preſently impart to any <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> a tincture, or the virtues of the whole Concrete. And in this preparation, no ſtrange quality is introduced to the Subject, nor its own proper quality loſt.</p>
                     <p>When I had by this means, learnt to unlock all Bodies whatſoever, conſiſting of a Saline bond, preſently from the Analogy of this, was made known the means of unlocking Subjects, whoſe Concretion is wholly Sulphureous: for I am wont ſo to prepare common Sulphur, that its powder immediatly impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates any Liquor, with the tincture and virtue of Sulphur. The Spirit of Wine, ſuddenly contracts a deep colour, and very red, that being put into it. Common water by the infuſion, or decoction of the ſame Powder, is rendered clearly Sulphureous, and gilds Silver, and by this means, from that Tincture, a praecipitation being made of White Wine, or Vinegar, the Milk of Sulphur is eaſily prepared, in great quantity. Out of Sulphurated Wine by this infuſion, I make a Syrrop, than which there is ſcarce found a more excellent remedy, in the diſtempers of the Thorax. By this means, Tinctures, Extracts, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries, are prepared from Sulphur, with no labour, and without any ſmatch of the fire. By the ſame way preparations from Amber, Benzoin, and other Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous things, eaſily diſſolvable in any <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> are compoſed. But enough and too much of this: we will now paſs to the other great diſſolvent of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the Nature of Fire: and by the way of Heat, and Light.</head>
                     <p>WE may almoſt pronounce the ſame thing of Fire, what the Philoſophers of old did of the firſt Matter, to wit, that it was potentially every where, and in all things; but in none, in act. For among theſe ſublunaries, Fire hath got no exiſtence of its own Nature, or certain means of duration: It is produced almoſt in every Subject, but is retained long in none, but it ſuddenly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, and expires: yea unleſs ſome external accidents, oftentimes ſhould concur for its production, I think it had not at all been in the world. Some have dreamed, that its Sphear is ſcituate under the Moon: but this was introduced only, for the making the Hypotheſis of the four Elements: for ſuch a thing ſeems conſonant neither to Senſe, nor Reaſon. That we may rightly ſearch out the Nature of Fire, we muſt ſeek in what Bodies it is chiefly to be found, and how they are diſpoſed; and then we may proceed to the unfolding its eſſence.</p>
                     <p>The Subjects moſt convenient both for the producing, and the maintaining of Fire, are of that kind, in which there are very many Particles of Sulphur, and but only a moderate portion of Water, Salt, and Earth: for theſe do hinder its inkindlings, and being plentifully poured on it, extinguiſh it being inkindled: Wherefore Bituminous, Fat, and Oyly things, quickly take flame: ſo alſo Chips, Straw, light and dry Wood: in the mean time, Metals, Minerals, the glebe of the Earth, Dung, wet Straw, and green Wood, are hardly, or not at all to be inkindled.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we obſerve, that all the time Fire continues in the Subject, Sulphureous Particles fly away in heaps, and from the departure of theſe, the ſubſtance of the burning body is by degrees deſtroyed; in the mean time, very much of Salt and Earth, remains in the form of Aſhes, after the burning.</p>
                     <p>There is a third obſervation, that when the Sulphureous Particles are wholly, or for the moſt part flown out of any Subject, the burning wholly ceaſes, and the form of fire is quite deſtroyed; nor can it be renewed in the remaining matter, wanting of Sulphur.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, we will note, that ſomtimes ſome Bodies conceive a burning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the advention of another fire, only by their own effervency, and by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine motion of the implanted Particles, and of their own accord are reduced into Aſhes; as when wet Hay is layd up cloſe, it firſt grows hot, then afterwards breaks forth into ſmoke and flame; or the Wheels and Axeltrees of Carts or Wains, being heated by too great agitation, are inkindled.</p>
                     <p>According to theſe poſitions, we may affirm, that the form of fire, wholly depends upon Sulphureous Particles, heaped up in any Subject, and breaking forth from it in heaps: and that fire is no other thing, than the motion and eruption, of theſe kind of Particles, impetuouſly ſtirred up. For Sulphur is of an exceeding fierce and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamed Nature, whoſe little bodies, when (the yoak of the mixture being ſhook off) they begin to be thickly heaped together, diffuſe themſelves on every ſide like a torrent, break whatſoever obſtacles are in the Subject, deſtroy whatever comes in oppoſition, or fling it down headlong. Nor do they only unlock their proper Subjects, but alſo lay open the gates and doors of any other Subject near, that they can reach to, and there incite to the like fury, all the conſimilary Particles of Sulphur, and provoke them to an eruption: wherefore fire every where inkindles fire.</p>
                     <p>The Sulphureous Particles, while they, heaped together within the confines of their Subject, or on its Superficies, are agitated with a rapid motion, but are detained by the Embrace of other little Bodies, from a more free eruption, and more aggregated, conſtitute the form of fire; as is to be ſeen in burning Coals, or in glowing Iron; but when theſe ſort of Particles fly away by heaps, from the ſame Subject, and bound together, they produce flame, which is only an heap, or rather a torrent, of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Sulphur flowing together, and conjunctly flying away: if Watery, Earthy,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:152521:26"/>
and Saline Particles, are commixt with the Sulphureous breaking away, and are able to disjoyn and ſeparate them, only ſmoke is excited; which afterwards, the Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous little Bodies more plentifully breathing forth themſelves, and getting together, breaks forth into flame.</p>
                     <p>The inkindling of Fire happens very many ways. The firſt and moſt ſimple is, when from hard bodies ſtruck one againſt another, but ofteneſt from a Flint ſtruck againſt Steel, ſparks of fire break forth; which being received in Tinder, made of a Linnen Cloth burnt to blackneſs, dilate themſelves, and then a Match or Sulphurated thing being applyed, they cauſe the inkindling of a flame. Secondly, a fire often happens in dry Wood, and dry things, when by the too great attrition of the parts, and agitation, being made hot, they conceive an inkindling of their own accord. And thirdly, when Bodies abounding with Sulphur, as Hay, or Flax laid up wet, (of which mention was before made) grow hot of their own accord, and afterwards are inkindled. The fourth way, is the moſt uſual, of introducing fire into any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that it may be inkindled by another fire. We will a little more conſider the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral proceſſes of theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Hard Bodies ſtruck one againſt another, ſhake forth little ſparks of fire: as a Flint with Iron, or with a Flint; <hi>Indian</hi> Canes, the Fire Stone, and many other things. The reaſon of this is, becauſe the Particles of Sulphur, which reſide in the Superficies of a hard Body, if they are ſmitten by another hard Body, are not able to go back inward, (becauſe in hard things there is not afforded any ceſſion of the parts, from place to place) nor can the ſmitten Particles of Sulphur evaporate by degrees; but that by reaſon of the vehemency of the ſtroke, they are neceſſitated to break forth in heaps: Wherefore, when by this means, many of them are moved together, and are aggregated, they exhibit the apparition of fire, The ſparks being received into the half-burnt Linnen or Tinder, are dilated into a greater fire, for that the Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Particles, in ſuch a Subject are eminent, and are brought as it were to the very top it ſelf of eruption or breaking forth, wherefore by the leaſt ſpark being moved or ſtirred up, a way being made they fly away.</p>
                     <p>The very ſame reaſon is for Wood being made hot, and afterwards fired, by too great attrition; by which means, the Axeltrees and Wheels of Chariots, or of Mills, are frequently fired: for the Sulphureous Particles, being by this means very much moved, are more thickly heaped together; and when, having as it were made an Army, they are able to remove, or ſtrike away the reſt, they preſently break forth in Troops, and by their going away cauſe a burning.</p>
                     <p>In Hay or Dung laid up wet, the Particles of Sulphur very much abound; which having gotten the watery Latex for a Vehicle, run themſelves into motion: but when for want of Ventilation, they cannot by little and little exhale, being ſtraitned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and ſo brought into their exaltation, they are able to joyn more one to another, and mutually to incite themſelves: then afterwards, being very much heaped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they unfold themſelves more largely, and begin to break the Dens of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and ſo produce a burning. For it is to be obſerved in any Subject, when the Particles of Sulphur, being more ſlowly moved, fly away by degrees, neither heat, nor fire, but only a dryneſs, and leanneſs, ſucceed. But if they are more rapidly moved, than that they may be able to exhale leiſurely, a heat is ſtirred up in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: then if yet they are agitated more vehemently, and impetuouſly, and being more thickly agglomerated or heaped together, they break forth in heaps, a deflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or flame follows the heat.</p>
                     <p>Fire being inkindled in any Subject, enters and inkindles, whatever Sulphureous thing is next it. For as Saline <hi>Menſtrua, viz.</hi> Stygian waters, aſſault Metals, ſtuffed with Mineral Salt, and looſen their Saline Particles, as being of kin, from the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſo alſo the Sulphureous Particles, being inkindled, break whatever Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Particles are next them, and ſtir them up into the like motion of burning, with themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Thus much concerning the nature and production of Fire: it remains that we next inquire into the effects of Fire, and alſo concerning its virtue and efficacy; to wit, what kind of Bodies it diſſolves, and by what means; and alſo for what uſes it ſerves for. The chief effects of Fire are Heat and Light; either of them are excited by emanations, or <hi>Effluvia,</hi> ſent from an inkindled Body; but after a far different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: for truly, heat is moſt often produced at a diſtance, without light; alſo light, without any ſenſible heat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:152521:27"/>Heat, foraſmuch as it belongs to the ſenſe of the touch, is conceived, when a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain paſſion is induced in the skin, or any other Organ of the touch, whereby the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Fibres and Nervous parts are drawn aſunder, moved into light Spaſms or Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſomtimes (if the ſtroke be vehement) ſuffer a ſolution of the union. This is wont to be done, either by the bringing near of Fire, or of another Body made hot by Fire, or by ſome other means. For from either, the Sulphureous or warming Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles being excited, into a more rapid motion, and breaking forth by heaps ſpread abroad, which, as ſo many little darts, being thruſt into our skin, or other Senſory of the touch, either by tickling gently, they bring to it a pleaſing ſenſe of heat; or by ſtriking it more grievouſly, the troubleſom ſenſe of burning or ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>For the effect of heat, Fire is applyed to Bodies, either immediatly, and ſo either for the ſake of Burning, Roſting or Boyling; or mediatly, <hi>viz.</hi> by the interjection of another Body. Bituminous things, Coals, and other things dug out of the Earth, alſo Vegetables and chiefly their Leaves, and Woods, are burnt, for heat, neceſſary for human uſes, and for the producing, and conſerving it. Stones are burnt for Lime; Vegetables for the preparing of Salts. The fleſh of Animals is wont to be Roſted, and the Fruits of Vegetables; whereby they may become better food for men. For by Roaſting, the ſuperfluous humidity is evaporated, and the Sulphureous parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtirred by the neighbouring heat, are placed in their vigor and exaltation, by which means, they afford a more grateful food to the Palat, and of better digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Stomach. By fire Metals are fuſed or melted, and moſt Minerals, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are either very much purified, or they are better formed into various fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures by Smiths. Metals, and very many Minerals, alſo Salts, although they are not inflamed, and take a firing (becauſe they abound with leſs Sulphur, than Salt) yet by a violent fire, they glow, and ſuffer a fuſion; for that the Sulphureous Particles of the Fire, enter the Saline little Bodies, tho moſt compact, and diſſociate them for the time; which however pulled one from another, preſently the fire being exhaled, come again together, and are ſtrictly united.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, when fire is mediatly adminiſtred, the Particles of the ſoluted Sulphur, and heaped together into fire, are diſſociated, as when a cloud is diſperſed into moſt little drops of Rain: wherefore they lay aſide the form of fire; but tho diſperſed, they eaſily paſs through any impediment, and induce a ſufficient ſtrong heat to every Subject. By this means, fire is accommodated to very many uſes, the chief of which, and the more accuſtomed, are, elixation or boyling, digeſtion, and diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                     <p>In Boyling, the Particles of heat do paſs into a watery <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and being united with its Particles, inſinuate themſelves deeply into the thing to be boyled: whoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous humidities they carry away, digeſt the crudities, and carry them into a ſtate of maturity. Boyling is inſtituted, either that the Liquor might be impregnated with the ſtrength of the thing to be Boyled, or that the thing to be Boyled might be made tender, by the Liquor entring into it, and its Particles exalted: for Meats and all Eatable things, are rendered more grateful to the Palate by Boyling, even as well as by Roſting.</p>
                     <p>Digeſtion is very much uſed in Medicines, that their more ſlow Particles, may be carried to a greater activity; and ſomtimes, that they being too fierce might be fixed, and rendred more mild.</p>
                     <p>The moſt noble uſe of heat, or of mediat fire, is had in diſtillations; for the Particles of heat, do pull away ſome Particles of the Subject from others, (as it were by a Spagyric Anatomy) they reſolve all Bodies, into their parts and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. But the conſideration of this thing, is too laborious and hard, to be inſerted into this Tract.</p>
                     <p>As heat reſpects the Senſory of the Touch, ſo Light that of the Sight, and affects it ſo after a proper and peculiar manner, that nothing at all is diſcerned, beſides the rays of light, direct, or reflected: for the various appearances of Colours, and the divers proportions of Bodies, and whatſoever we ſee with our Eyes, is only light; to wit, either proceeding directly, or ſtrait from a lucid Body, or retorted from another Body, to the Eye, and ſo formed into various figures and colours. The conſideration of Light, contains in it ſelf, very many ſtupendious things, and is of deep ſpeculation; which are not however proper for this place: It will ſuffice to take notice here, of a few things, concerning its Original, Motion, and Perceptibility.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:152521:27"/>Light is wont to be diſtinguiſhed, either that it is Etherial, which flows from the Sun and Stars; or Elementary, which only proceeds from a fired Body, enkindled into a flame. It ſeems, that either is only flame enkindled in a greater dimenſion, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into a moſt thin compoſition: for it appears to the ſenſe, that from Sulphureous things being inflamed, (as for example) from a burning Candle, moſt thin <hi>Effluvia's,</hi> or moſt ſmall divided little Bodies perpetually do ſpring; which being diffuſed into an Orb, and ſtretched forth into right Lines, as it were from the Centre to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, are ſtill expanded on every ſide, in a great heap, and fill all the ſpace within the Sphear of its activity, with a luminous ray. The Particles of the flame, which firſt fall away or depart from a lucid Body, are ſtill driven forward by thoſe following behind; and ſo theſe alſo by others; and ſo by a continued Series of Particles of the flames ſtill ſucceeding, the beams of light are formed, and are thickly or cloſly dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted into all parts.</p>
                     <p>The motion of theſe is exceeding ſwift; like ſtreams of water, breaking forth with a force, they paſs through the medium in the twinckling of an Eye, and, as thoſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, if the motion be cut off near the Spring, moſt ſwiftly vaniſh. When the Rays of light come directly from a Luminous Body, they conſtitute a medium, only clear or lucid, without the appearance of any colour or image: when the ſame Rays meet with a ſolid Body, they do not paſs rightly through it, but being either broken off, they are drowned or loſt, or elſe they are reflected and leap back or rebound, as when a Ball being caſt againſt a Wall, with a continued motion is ſtruck back, upon other parts, according to the Angles of what ſtopped it. The Rays of light, reflected from other Bodies, being fallen into the Eye, repreſent the Images of viſible things, and the varieties of colours. For as the ſuperficies of viſible Bodies are rough, and indued with little pores, and innumerable eminences, or riſings up, hence the Rays of light, being moſt thickly impacted in them, and reflected from every part, according to all the ways of inclinations, and directions, as far as they go, do meet together round about, into very many tops of Cones, in which the beams proceeding from the whole object, as from a baſe, repreſent the image or ſimilitude of the whole; and in theſe kind of images, the medium is every where planted, that wherever the Eye is placed, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the image of the ſame thing, though not wholly after the ſame manner. But foraſmuch, as the beams of the ſame light, being impacted in every Body, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly refracted and diſtorted, about its rough and unequal ſuperficies, from thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected as it were with turnings and windings into the Eye, they cauſe the diverſe Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena or appearances of colours, to appear. For colous, and images of things, do not exiſt in their own nature, but as it were ſpectrums, only from another place, change their apparitions by the Rays of light. When dark night brings thick dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to this inferior world, things are not perceived but by the Touch, and loſe all their appearances: when the Sun reviſits the Hemiſphere, he brings forth a new Creation of things; and the whole Atmoſphere is filled at once, with a ſudden and manifold progeny, to wit, with infinite images of Bodies, and appearances of colours.</p>
                     <p>Therefore Light does not only illuſtrate the medium, that ſight may be made, as ſome would have it; but it alſo creates the very objects of ſight, and introduces them into the Penetralia or inward parts of the Eye, yea to the moſt inward receſſes of the Brain. This doth the ſame Office for the Eye, as the Intellect doth for the Soul, to wit, it forms the Ideas or Images of Bodies, and renders them perceptible by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive faculty. Light only is able to penetrate the Coats and Humors of the Eye, to move the little Fibres of the Optic Nerve, and to ſtir them up into an act of ſenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Becauſe the Images of things, being forged by the Rays of light, variouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected, and meeting together on the tops of the Cones, are ſtayed within the Pupil, or dark ſpot of the Eye; they ſeem as objects in a cloſe Chamber, admitted by a ſmall hole, to be repreſented to the life: and the Concave or Convex Glaſſes, whereby the parallel beams are broken, or the inverſe reduced or brought back, do egregiouſly ſupply the humors placed in the Eye, beyond the induſtry of human Art; by the help of which, the image of every object is painted, near the thin skin of the Eye, in its juſt figure and proportion: and then, from the motion, which this Image impreſſes on the little Fibres of the Optick Nerve, the act of ſight is performed in the Brain. Thus much for Heat and Light, the Speculation of which, tho it may ſeem to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether beſides the Doctrine of Fermentation, yet foraſmuch as by the motion of theſe kind of Sulphureous Particles, many other Phyſical Operations are alſo performed, a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:152521:28"/>
brief mention of them ought not to have been overpaſs'd in this place. But before we ſhall lay aſide quite the conſideration of Fire, it will be here worth our while to inquire concerning ſome Subjects, as it were irregular, to wit, in which fire ſhews ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable virtues, and beyond its common manner: of this ſort, are among Simples common Sulphur, and <hi>Sal Nitre;</hi> among Compounds, Gun-Powder, and <hi>Aurum Fulminans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning common Sulphur we may obſerve, that it quickly catches fire, heat it immediatly breaks forth into flame ſuch (as nothing beſides) that by its deflagration it puts out the Kitchen fire, that it ſends forth a blueiſh flame, and whitens all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with its Smoke or Soot. If you behold the matter of this Subject, or the parts of which the mixture is compoſed, its Spagyrical Analyſis will exhibit, great plenty of pure Sulphur, a moderate quantity of Vitriolic Salt, a little of Spirit, Water and Earth. For when common Sulphur is diſſolved, by the Spirit of Turpentine, the Sulphureous part impregnates the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> with a very deep Tincture, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line grows into Cryſtals: or when it is fired under a Bell, the Sulphur wholly burns, in the mean time the Salt being reſolved, and having taken a Flux, is fixed about the ſides of the Veſſel, and ſo exhibits a Liquor, moſt like the Spirit of Vitriol, or rather the very ſame. To which add, if you mingle the Oyl of Vitriol, and Antimony to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and diſtill it in a Retort, a Yellow Sulphur, juſt like the common, will be Sublimed in the neck of the Retort.</p>
                     <p>I ſay therefore, becauſe there are very many Particles of Sulphur in this Concrete, and that they lie looſe and unbound in the mixture, (to wit, neither divided and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated by the coming between of Earth, or Water, nor much bound together by Salt) therefore they are of a moſt prompt motion: wherefore by the leaſt ſpark of fire, they break forth from the looſe frame; and becauſe very many run forth adoors toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therefore not a naked fire, as in every Combuſtible thing beſides, but firſt of all and immediatly a flame is inkindled. Its flame becomes blueiſh, becauſe 'tis almoſt pure Sulphur that burns, not mixed with the Particles of Water and Earth, as it is in Wood or Straw. The very ſame thing happens to Spirit of Wine being inflamed. It extinguiſhes the Kitchen fire by reaſon of the little Bodies of Vitriolic Salt left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; and the ſame being eventilated with the flame and fume of Sulphur, gives a white colour to things; the like to which, the <hi>Effluvia's,</hi> exhaled from the Spirit of Vitriol, or Stygian Waters, do effect.</p>
                     <p>Concerning <hi>Sal Nitre,</hi> we will take notice, that it is not to be inkindled at all by it ſelf; but to be melted by an intenſe fire: but being mixed with any Sulphureous things, it breaks forth into a flame, with a certain force and exploſion: For being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to common Sulphur, Antimony, or Tartar, it burns with a thundering noiſe; alſo if you put into melted Nitre, a burning Cole, or Wood, the flame is exploded round about, with a wind, ſo that the matter put in is flung up and down here and there, and often times flung clear out of the Veſſel: by this kind of deflagration, what is Nitrous is conſumed, the fixed Salt (which is Tartar) remains. When Nitre is diſtilled, Sand or Brick duſt, is mixt with it in a double quantity at leaſt; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Nitre melting is not at all looſened into a vapor. In the diſtilling the vapor ſent forth is very red; ſo that the Receptacle ſhines with a ſplendor, as if a flame were ſhut up within it: a ſharp corroſive Liquor is ſtilled forth, which diſſolves moſt Metals; alſo Gold.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things being truly weighed, it ſeems that this mixture conſiſts chiefly of aboundance of Salt, and a little Sulphur, but theſe not fixed and idle, but either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, and ready for motion, and not without a certain reſiſtance bound together: to wit, the Sulphureous little Bodies, being rouled about by the Saline, and as it were ſtrictly preſſed, ſtill endeavour to get forth; but being ſtrictly bound within, they are not able to riſe forth by their own ſtrength, or endeavour: but as ſoon as, by the mixture and inkindling of another Sulphureous Body, the Particles of the Salt are disjoyned, and their Priſons unlocked, preſently the included little Bodies of Sulphur, as it were breaking Priſon, fling themſelves forth with violence, remove every Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and ſtrike the Air violently with a ſudden eruption.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why fire doth not inkindle Nitre, being incloſed in a Veſſel, but only melts it, when in the mean time, any Sulphureous matter being fired, makes it to flame forth with a noiſe, is, becauſe the little Bodies, which fall away from the fire, enter the Nitre, make it a little looſe, and diſſociate the concretion of the Salt, but not ſo looſen it, that a way may be made for the included Sulphur: but by the addition
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:152521:28"/>
of Sulphureous things, the Saline compaction is more diſſolved, and is ſo far unlocked, that the Particles of the incloſed Sulphur fly away all together, and being freed from their ſtraightneſs, do hugely ſtretch themſelves abroad, and ſeek greedily an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe ſpace.</p>
                     <p>That there is plenty of Sulphur in Nitre, beſides its deflagration, the Geneſis of it ſufficiently teſtifies; for it is begot chiefly in places, where the Sulphureous Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Animals abound. The uſe of it in agriculture argues the ſame thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the fertility of the Earth depends very much upon it: And to this alſo, the flaming colour, ſhining in the diſtilling may perſuade.</p>
                     <p>From theſe premiſes, it will not be difficult, to unfold the nature of Gun-Powder, uſed in Warlike Inſtruments. For the ſudden firing, and vehement exploſion of it ariſe, for that thoſe very many, and almoſt infinite Particles of Sulphur, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute that fire-dilating Body, being fired, fly away together in a moment; all which breaking forth at once, a force being made, and deſiring a moſt free and ample ſpace, for their expanſion, violently move the Air, and all obſtacles, and ſo are exploded or thruſt forth with a noiſe. There is in this mixture, common Sulphur put, becauſe its Particles are looſe, and ready for motion, and therefore apt to move a quick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindling: there is added Charcoal duſt, becauſe in that alſo, the little Sulphureous Bodies (as is ſeen in Tinder, that is made of half burnt Linnen) are brought to the very top of eruption; and therefore theſe preſently conceive an inkindling, and both theſe being fired, and oppoſed to the Nitre, they quickly looſen its frame, and ſend forth the Sulphureous Particles incloſed in it; which indeed break forth from their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments with a force, and as the blaſt of a Bellows, encreaſe the ſtrength of the whole in firing. The Charcoal duſt is added in a moderate quantity; though it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with Terreſtrial matter, yet by reaſon of the Sulphur being carried forth in it, it accelerates the deflagration of this mixture: For the Coal and Nitre being beaten together, is ſooner fired, and with a greater exploſion, than Nitre and Sulphur: But if the Coals be added to this Compoſition, (as they are wont to make it for Cannon and great Guns) in a greater quantity than it ought, and improportionate to the Nitre, the immediat firing is ſomwhat retarded, by reaſon of the interjection of the Earthy matter; and it happens, that the Sulphureous little Bodies therein, apt to be too haſtily inkindled, are a little disjoyned, and ſo the ſubſtance of the infuſed powder, takes fire ſucceſſively, and by parts, and not all at once.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of <hi>Aurum Fulminans</hi> does not ſo manifeſtly appear: but it ſeems won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, that the Calx of a Metal, otherways inviolable by fire, ſhould be brought into a powder, one grane of which, if it be but lightly heated by fire, is exploded with ſo great a force, and yields ſuch a noiſe, that is an hundred fold beyond Gun-powder. I know many deduce the cauſe of this, as in Gun-powder, from a Nitrous-Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mixture: For they ſuppoſe the Nitre drawn forth from the ſolvent <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> to joyn together with the Sulphur of the Metal, and ſo the powder from thence prepared, to get that fulminating force. But in truth, if this matter be better thought on, it will appear far otherways; becauſe this golden thundring powder, is not at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled, as preparations of Nitre with Sulphur: for if fire be put to it, it goes off only ſucceſſively, by grains, nor as in Gun-powder, doth the whole fulminate at once; but being put into an Iron, Silver, or other convenient Veſſel, and for ſome time heated, by a ſudden fire, at length all the Particles being ſtirred together into motion, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded with a mighty noiſe; but yet being exploſed, it yields neither flame nor ſparks neither is the Gold loſt. For if this powder fulminates in an open Veſſel; whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is of the Gold, remains after the thundering, in the form of a purple powder; and may be gathered up. That the genuine cauſe of this may be extricated, there are ſome things to be obſerved, concerning its preparations, which will give no ſmall light.</p>
                     <p>For the making of this powder, it is altogether requiſite, that a ſolution of Gold be made with a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> impregnated with Sal Armoniack, or at leaſt Analogical to it: for I have tryed it in vain with the Spirit of Nitre, Salt, with the Bezoartic Spirit, and ſome others. Then next it is requiſite, that the Calx be precipitated with Oyl of Tartar; for if the ſame be brought into a powder, with Silver or Mercury being caſt in, it loſes its thundring force. Alſo, if the Liquor of the Tartar, be too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitately poured in, that with the great heat, a repercuſſion of the thing ſoluted be made, it often loſes its fulminating virtue: but a precipitation being leiſurely made, the powder ſetling in the bottom is waſhed away, by the often pouring on of warm water, which, though it be moſt often waſhed and dryed, far exceeds the weight of the diſſolved Gold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:152521:29"/>According to theſe poſitions, in ſeems moſt likely, that whilſt the Gold is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by an appropriate <hi>Menſtruum</hi> for this buſineſs, ſome little Bodies of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> (or ſome other reſembling it) being greatly akin to the Gold, do moſt ſtrictly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here with its Particles; which then by the Salt of Tartar leiſurely in the precipitating infuſed, are more fixed, and more ſtrictly tyed faſt together: and then the exploſion of this powder, or Solary Calx, is nothing elſe than a violent eruption of thoſe kind of Salts, from the Coheſion or Embrace of the Gold. For when the powder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared after this manner; is brought to the fire, or is otherways made hot: the heat cauſes the <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> Particles, or others of the ſame nature affixed to the Solar, to diſſociate; which notwithſtanding, (when they hardly depart one from another) are not pulled aſunder but by a ſtrong and continued heat: yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being pulled aſunder with a certain force, by reaſon of the ſudden and violent breaking off, they ſtrike the Air impetuouſly, and ſo cauſe a moſt ſtrong noiſe, for their bulk. But in the mean time, if the exploſion be made under a Silver Spoon, you will ſee a ſeparation made of either Particles, here the Solar of a Purple colour, there the Saline of an Aſh colour. But that this powder doth not make a noiſe, unleſs it be leiſurely precipitated with the Oyl of Tartar, it is becauſe ſome Particles of the Salt of Tartar, being before bound together with the <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, do couple together, by which means all are more ſtrongly combined: For the Salt of Tartar being pounded with the mixture of Nitre and Sulphur fixes their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles for a time; that this Compoſition is not preſently inkindled by heat; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is exploded with a ſtrong noiſe. And powder prepared after this manner ſeems to imitate the Nature of <hi>Aurum Fulminans:</hi> and it is probable that from other Minerals diſſolved and precipitated by reaſon of the ſtrict Coheſions of the Salt with the Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic matter, and their violent abruptions, thundering Calxes may be prepared. That truly the preparation of this chiefly depends on the Combination of the Salts, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, becauſe, if in the Precipitating (as I have known it ſomtimes to have hapned) the Oyl of Tartar, being too haſtily infuſed, the Complexion of the Salts is diſſolved with the Metallic matter, the powder falls in ſmall quantity to the bottom, and of a very Purple colour, whoſe grains are fragments of almoſt moſt pure Gold, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do not fulminate at all: afterwards in that precipitated Liquor, very many ſlender Cryſtals grow together, which are indeed the Salts, having ſuffered a Divorce from the Metal. Beſides, That the Salt of Tartar, brings ſomthing to the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this powder, it is a ſign, becauſe thoſe things which take away the fulminating force from this, are of the ſame Nature, which chiefly work upon the Salt of Tartar; as a beating it together with common Sulphur, Spirit of Salt, Oyl of Vitriol, or of Sulphur: for theſe grow hot, and greedily deſire to be joyned with the Salt of Tartar, and ſo they call it away from the Embraces of the Gold; by which means the Combination of the Salts, with the Particles of the Gold, is looſned, and therefore loſes its Gun-like force. What is commonly ſaid, that this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will be preſently inkindled, or exploded, by a moſt light heat, or by ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in an Iron Ladle, is nothing true, as appears to me, for I have often tryed it. Nor is it more worthy of belief, what is ſaid, that this only forces downwards, and breaks the thickeſt hollow Pipes with its force; in the mean time, that it doth not move or ſhake any thing laid over it, becauſe long ſince I made tryal after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; two grains of this being laid in a Silver Spoon, I covered with a Doller, then a Candle being held under the Spoon, upon the exploſion of the powder, there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great noiſe, and there was a little hollow made in the bottom of the Spoon, almoſt through, and the piece of mony was carried up with a force to the Cieling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when this <hi>Aurum Fulminans</hi> is exploſed, its force is diffuſed round.</p>
                     <p>Altho vehement heat, and incited, and alſo the emiſſion of Smoke and Soot, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends for the moſt part upon fire; yet ſomtimes we perceive it to be produced in ſome ſubjects, and that in a very high degree, without its being actually inkindled. A moſt known inſtance of which thing is, quick Lime ſprinkled with water: which alſo Sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian waters ſhew, being mingled with Iron, the Butter of Antimony, and with the Salts of the ſtagma of Vegetables. The learned men, <hi>Gunter, Conringius, Hogelan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and almoſt all that have touched on the Doctrine of Fermentation, have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the effects of this Nature, as eſpecial examples of Fermentations, wherefore it will be worth our labour, to inquire ſomthing concerning each of them: but on this condition (which I alſo have obſerved in other diſquiſitions) that I willingly let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone the opinion of others; for a Traveller had rather drink at the Fountains
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:152521:29"/>
themſelves: I will then as briefly and ſuccinctly as I can diſpatch the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>Quick-Lime is made of the Lime Stone, alſo of many others (excepting only ſuch which conſiſt of a reddiſh and as it were ſandy grain) being Calcined in a cloſe Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, for many days, with a reverberating fire: by this means, the frame of the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is looſned, that it goes into a friable matter, or that may be crumbled, which by reaſon of the high aſtriction or binding Nature, in which it excels, ſerves moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently for the making of Cements for Walls: This Calx or Lime being taken from the Furnace, reteins ſtill the form of Stone, and ſeems cold to the touch, but water being poured thereon, it ſwells up, and grows wonderfully hot, ſending forth ſmoak, that it burns all Bodies that are put into it, beſides it falls of it ſelf into a white duſt: To which Particles this motion and heat ought to be aſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> whether to thoſe implanted in the Lime ſtone, or to the others acquired by the fire, doth not eaſily appear: but that we may looſe this knot, if we can, I have inſtituted this Analyſis of quick Lime. I put about half a pound of it into a large Cucurbit, then water being poured thereon, I fitted the little Head with a capacious Receiver, by and by, within five mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of an hour, the matter began to ſwell, and to grow very hot; then a ſmoak, and a breath being raiſed, all the Veſſels became ſo hot, that I could ſcarce touch them with my hands. A clear water Diſtilled forth into the Receiver, about ſix Ounces, which was not ſharp, but of a Styptic or Aſtringent ſweetiſh taſt; the remaining powder in the Cucurbit, I boiled with common water, and the Lye thereof made, I endeavoured to boil away with a gentle Fire; while it did evaporate, there ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together on the Superfices of the Liquor, a white and cruſty little skin, alſo of a ſweetiſh taſt, and the ſame being taken away, preſently a new one ſucceeded; the humor being at laſt wholly exhaled, there remained in the bottom nothing that was ſharp or ſalt.</p>
                     <p>We may Collect from this, that this heat doth not proceed from the implanted Principles of the Lime ſtone, <hi>viz.</hi> either Saline or Sulphureous however moved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves: for only a ſweetiſh Salt was to be found in it, which was alſo Volatile; and it is a ſign that there is not much Sulphur in the Limeſtone, becauſe by a long Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination, the form of the mixture is not quite deſtroyed, nor its ſubſtance wholly broken: wherefore, it is very likely, that whilſt theſe ſtones are burnt in the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, ſome Particles of Fire do ſtrictly cleave to the Saline, and ſo reſide in that mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it were ſtrangers; which whilſt they lie a ſleep, and continue idle, and being ſeparated one from another, by the coming between of Earth, although they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many, do not raiſe up heat; For all heat depends upon motion: but when water is poured to it, thoſe fiery Particles, being thruſt out of their Cells, flow together, and fly aways by heaps from that Inn; ſo breaking forth by Troops, they cauſe a very intenſe heat, and becauſe diluted with water, only a ſmoak, and not an actual Fire.</p>
                     <p>It is a ſign that little Bodies of fire, or fiery Particles, do ſtick a long while in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Calcined, becauſe Iron Inſtruments, according as thoſe Particles are driven forth of their pores, more or leſs, leiſurely or by heaps, become ſoft or hard; tough or brittle: moreover it is obſerved, that bricks or freſh Earthen Veſſels being dipped in water, cauſe a certain hiſſing; alſo Tobacco Pipes, if one end be put into water, and the other brought near to the Ear, yield a certain ſharp noiſe and rumbling: add to theſe, that fixed Salts being Calcined, or having ſuffered a Flux by the Fire, become far ſharper; alſo Stygian waters, by reaſon of thoſe kind of little Bodies involved therein, which afterwards leiſurely evaporate, perpetually ſend forth ſharp fumes: and when theſe are poured upon Saline Calxes, not only an Ebullition is raiſed, by reaſon of the diſagreeing Particles of the Salts, which ſtrike one another mutually, whereby they might be more ſtrictly combined; but beſides, heat and ſmoak ſucceed, which for the moſt part ariſe from the fiery Particles being ſhuck out of their Dens. But it is not eaſie to give a reaſon why quick Lime, and no other Concretes, retain ſo copiouſly thoſe kind of fiery Particles, and yield a ſtrong heat, water being poured on them.</p>
                     <p>Tis plain enough that when the Sulphureous Effluviums of Fire, (foraſmuch as they are moſt penetrating) enter all Bodies whatſoever, brought near, affect them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter divers manners: thoſe which are more lax, and ſtuffed with active Principles, are deſtroyed wholly by burning, and becauſe their ſubſtance decays, the fiery Particles, as Soldiers in a City ſpoiled by themſelves, do not continue long in the ruined place,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:152521:30"/>
but go farther, and move their Tents: but where the Concretion of the Subject is very compact, and that its Elements cannot be ſo pulled in pieces by the fire, that they rather grow ſtiff, as is ſeen in Metals, Glaſs, Bricks, and other things made hard, either by boiling, or fuſion; the fiery Particles entered in, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in an incommodious Inn, preſently go forth again; and therefore few are wont to ſtay in mixt things of this kind, or in things fuſed, or Calcined: but if fire be ſo applyed to the more hard Concretes, of which ſort are moſt ſtones, and ſhelly Concretes, that the bond of the mixture be unlocked, ſome parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Watery and Sulphureous are driven away, and ſo ſome ſpaces are made hollow, very fit for the receiving any ſtranger; in the mean time, that the frame of the matter be not wholly deſtroyed, but that it may continue its compacted and ſtony form, which flows not away together with its Particles, and ever threatens its ruin; in ſuch a Subject, chiefly the Particles of fire, poſſeſſing the ſpaces of the parts flown away, copiouſly remain; and there cleaving cloſe to the Saline little Bodies, being detained one from another, by the coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween of the earthy, lie quiet; which notwithſtanding afterwards, being violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly driven from thoſe Inns, are able to produce by their eruption, an intenſe, and almoſt fiery heat: in the mean time thoſe Saline little Bodies, are ſo looſned, by the long familiarity of the fiery, and by the embrace of one another, and of the ſtrangers, that they become Volatile, and being diluted with water, for the greateſt part evaporate with it; and the remaining Salt, becauſe alſo Volatile, and having ſuffered almoſt a divorce from all the reſt of the Principles, is both ſweetiſh, and becomes deſirous of Conjunction, and aſtringent; and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is of excellent uſe for plaſtring of Walls.</p>
                     <p>But that Stygian waters, being poured upon the Stagmas of fixed Salts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce heat, and the ſame mixed with Iron, or the Butter of Antimony, ſtir up a mighty ardor, with a blackning ſmoak, the reaſon ſeems plain. As to the Stygian waters and fixed Salts, it may be ſaid that both theſe Concretes are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Salts, having got divers ſtates by the fire, and ſo either being very much ſtuffed with fiery Particles (which are the moſt minute atoms of Sulphur:) But they being confuſed together, do forthwith ruſh into mutual embraces, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Particles of either, are made unlike, therefore, whereby they may be more ſtrictly united, there is made a great attrition of parts, and together an excuſſion of the fiery Particles, from whence the great ebullition, with a heat is excited: when the ſame <hi>Menſtrua,</hi> are poured on Iron, or the Ice of Antimo, the Salts of either come together, and ſhake forth the fiery Particles, and alſo the Sulphureous Particles, before implanted in either Subject; which flying away in heaps, cauſe a ſmoak with a heat, but not a flame.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the motion of Fermentation, as it is to be obſerved, in the Precipitation of Bodies.</head>
                     <p>WE have hitherto treated of the Solutions of Bodies; it remains now that we ſpeak of Precipitation, this is performed only in Liquids, which, when as they are ſtuffed with Heterogeneous Particles, are compelled by a matter Precipitating thoſe Particles, to ſeparate one from another, and to obtain for their ſubſtance, divers places and conditions: wherefore, ſince in this operation, there is an agitation and motion of parts, its conſideration ought to be referred to the Doctrine of Fermentation.</p>
                     <p>Precipitation is performed, either in Natural things, as chiefly in Milk, Blood, Urine, and perhaps in ſome others; or in Artificial things, which are of a diverſe Kind and Nature: but they may be deſcribed and ranked in a certain order, according as the Liquor to be Precipitated, or Precipitating, is either Spirituous, Sulphureous, Watery, or Saline: beſides, according as the Particles ſeparated from the reſt, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Elementary, (<hi>viz.</hi> either Sulphureous, Earthy, or Saline) or Integral, which participate of the Nature of the whole mixture, and are only very ſmall portions of it very much broken.</p>
                     <p>There are two common and known ways of Precipitation, whereby is made from Milk, both Cheeſe, and Butter: As to the firſt, if any ſharp thing be poured into warm Milk, the thicker and Cheeſie parts, preſently ſeparate from the ſerous and thinner, and are gathered together into a thick ſubſtance. The reaſon of which conſiſts in this: Milk has a ſomwhat thick conſiſtence, and its pores and paſſages are very much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, with the thicker (to wit the Cheeſie) contents; wherefore when ſomthing more ſubtil and penetrating, (as is Rennet) paſſes through the Liquor, it eaſily thruſts forth the more thick Particles, with which the pores were poſſeſſed; which then mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually Embrace one another, and are ſeparated a part from the thin, and Wheyie Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. When Milk is kept long to a ſourneſs, it is Precipitated after the ſame manner, without Rennet, by warming it over the fire. For in ſtale Milk its Saline parts get a Flux, then being ſtirred up by the fire, ſupply by their own ſourneſs the turn of Rennet, yea it is not improbable that the fluid Salt in the Rennet provokes the Saline Particles of the Milk, into a Flux, and that for this reaſon chiefly its Coagulation ſucceeds: for that the Saline parts having gotten of their own accord a Flux, ſo bind the pores of the Liquor, that the more thick Contents are willingly exterminated from them: wherefore we do ſay, for that reaſon, the ſame thing happens, when a Flux of the ſame Salt is cauſed by ſome thing elſe put into it. But that the Coagulation of Milk happens not only by reaſon of the paſſages and pores being poſſeſſed by a ſtrange Body, the ſign is; becauſe the Salt of Tartar, tho exceeding Precipitatory, effects nothing of this, and this effect is excited almoſt only by ſour things. Sugar hinders the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation of Milk, and many other Liquors, becauſe it reſtrains the Flux of the Ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Salt, and as it is eaſily Soluble, and its Particles are ſoft and blunt, they extrude not the former Contents implanted in the Liquor, but fill all vacuities, that afterwards there is no ſpace whereby another Precipitating Liquor may unfold it ſelf, and break into anothers quarters.</p>
                     <p>But Country people are wont to make Butter of the Flowers or Cream of Milk, kept for the moſt part to a ſourneſs, only by ſhaking or Churning it. The reaſon of which (as it ſeems to me) is this: in Cream there is great plenty of Sulphur, with which alſo a mean portion of Salt and Earth is mixed, as may be conjectured, both by the ſourneſs of the Liquor remaining of the Butter, or the Butter-Milk, and by its thicker conſiſtency. In this mixture, the parts both Saline and Sulphureous are in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a Flux: but as the Liquor is thicker they cannot preſently fly away: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it remains, that if the bond of the mixture be further looſned, they will ſeparate into parts, and that firſt the Sulphureous Particles, which exceed the others in power, are Congregated together with a mutual embrace; wherefore theſe two things, the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152521:31"/>
Churning of the Cream performs, <hi>viz.</hi> it brings the Sulphureous parts by their often obvolution together, whereby they do the better intangle themſelves, and mutually enſnare one another; beſides it breaks their mixture with the reſt. For this reaſon, in the Winter time, (when Cream is thinner, and abounds leſs with Sulphur) Butter is hardly made. Beſides the admixtion of Salt or Sugar wholly hinders its making; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the coming between of thoſe little Bodies, the Sulphureous parts are hindred, from a mutual adheſion.</p>
                     <p>The chief Precipitation of the blood, which is performed within a living Body, is made in the Reins; where, not without the ſtrength of a certain Coagulum or Rennet, the ſerous matter is ſeparated from the reſt of the blood; juſt as Whey from Milk: For which reaſon Diuretical things are of the ſame Nature, as thoſe which bring a Coagulation to Milk; and therefore, becauſe they more Precipitate the blood by fuſing it, they cauſe a large profuſion of urine. The blood being ſent forth of the Veſſels, ſeparates into various ſubſtances, by its own diſpoſition: whilſt it is warm, it is variouſly Precipitated, by ſome Liquors poured to it, (in like manner Urine) not without a pleaſant Spectacle. If you pour upon warm blood the ſpirit of Wine, Harts Horn, Soot, Vitriol, or other Liquors, chiefly Spirituous or Saline, a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ebullition, and heat is ſtirred up; whence we may conjecture after what manner it grows turgid, in Feavers. But before the reſt. the Salt of Tartar, and a Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Alum, procure both in Blood and in Urin, a great perturbation of the Liquor, and falling down of the parts: for theſe diſturb all the Contents in the pores and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the Liquor, and by their aſtriction, very much lock them up for a long time.</p>
                     <p>Precipitation in Artificial things is of greater note and uſe: for this for the moſt part follows Diſſolutions, and ſucceeds them as it were by a certain right of Order; becauſe this takes out of their Jaws, and as it were lays by, the prey, which all <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrua</hi> take by diſſolving. According to the diverſity of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and of the Body diſſolved, Precipitation alſo variouſly happens: but in ſome Subjects there are two chief remarkable things, concerning the manner of Precipitation, to wit, the ſoluted Particles, immerſed in the pores and paſſages of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> are wont to fall out of them; either by reaſon of the narrowneſs of the conteining ſpace, or elſe by reaſon of the Contents being increaſed in weight and bigneſs: for in ſome the pores of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, being either leiſurely bound up, or beſet with a ſtrange Body, ſhut forth from their Cells, the little Bodies of the thing ſoluted, and ſend them to the bottom; as may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Sulphureous Solutions, or ſuch as are made of the whole mixture of integral parts, in a thin Liquor; which are diſturbed, and lay away their Contents by external cold, ſimple water, or at leaſt by any Acid infuſion. After this manner reſinous Tinctures, alſo of Sulphur, Olibanum, Benzoin, and the infuſions and decoctions of Vegetables, alſo Urin, Milk, and Blood, are wont to be Precipitated: but in ſeveral others, beſides that the pores, and paſſages of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> are either leiſurely drawn together, or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by a new gueſt, alſo ſomthing new grows to the Particles of the thing ſoluted from the Precipitating matter, whereby being increaſed in weight and bulk, they can be no longer ſuſtained; but that they are neceſſitated to ſink to the bottom. This is chiefly ſeen in the Saline Solutions of Minerals, which are only Precipitated by the Salts; whoſe Particles preſently cleave to the little Bodies of the thing ſoluted, and increaſe their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that preſently they deſcend to the bottom by their own weight: For in Saline ſolutions, the little Bodies of the thing ſoluted, are ſtrictly bound together by the fluid <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> with the Saline Particles; and the Particles run haſtily and are heaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into the Embraces of the ſame fluid Salt, from the Precipitating infuſion of the fixed Salt: wherefore, when theſe three, (to wit, the little Bodies of either Salt, and of the ſoluted matter) do cohere together, they conſtitute greater grains than can be contained in the narrow ſpaces of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and therefore being thruſt out, they fall down towards the bottom: That this does truly happen after this manner, the great affinity, both of the fluid and fixed Salt, is a ſign; that the Particles of both being placed near or mixed together, are preſently combined in one: alſo, becauſe many ſolutions of Minerals, are preſently Precipitated by a fixed Salt, but not by Vitriol or Alum be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put in, which do much more bind, and ſtop up the pores of the Liquor. Thirdly, it appears clearly even to ſenſe, becauſe that the matter put for a Precipitate, far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the thing ſoluted in bulk and weight, and is impregnated by the fixed Salt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to it, But theſe being thus diſpoſed, we will deſcend to the particular caſes of Percipitations, foraſmuch as Precipitation is made manifold, to wit, according to the diverſity of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> of the ſoluted matter, and the Precipitating infuſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:152521:31"/>Simple water, though it do not well ſuſtain the Particles of the mixture which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives into it ſelf by infuſion, or Coheſion, yet hardly ſends them away by Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the pores of this <hi>Menſtruum</hi> are too open and looſe, wherefore the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitating matter, doth not eaſily ſtrike the little Bodies of the thing ſoluted: in the mean time, by reaſon of the more looſe frame of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> ſome parts of the ſoluted Body ſink down; others of their own accord evaporate, from whence that Liquor doth not long keep the Virtues or Tincture, with which they are impregnated by another. As ſome more thick parts and Terreſtrial may be thruſt down to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, or otherways ſeparated, we put in the Juice of Limons, or ſome acid thing, or boil in it the whites of Eggs, to wit, that whatſoever is thick might cleave to their viſcous ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>Spirituous and Sulphureous <hi>Menſtrua,</hi> being impregnated with the Sulphureous Particles of the thing ſoluted, eaſily lay by their burthen; for they are Precipitated by common, or any Diſtilled water; as is ſeen in Sulphureous and Reſinous Tinctures of Sulphur, Scammony, Benzoin, Frankincenſe, and others of that kind prepared by the Spirit of Wine, or Oyl of Turpentine, which preſently grow Milky, by Water or Phlegm being infuſed. For in theſe ſort of ſolutions, the pores are wholly poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that they admit nothing beſides the thing ſoluted, and beſides, both the Liquor, and ſoluted Matter are ſo thin, that they eaſily give place to any thing elſe being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Menſtruas</hi> of this kind are filled with Saline Particles, as we may obſerve in the Tinctures of the Salt of Corrals, of Tartar and ſuch like, Precipitation does not preſently ſucceed from common water, but from an Acid Liquor, as the Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Saline <hi>Menſtruas</hi> impregnated by the ſolutions of Stones or Metals, are moſt eaſily Precipitated by Saline Particles, and ſcarce by others. The chief Precipitatory Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, is the Salt of Tartar, or of Herbs burnt to Aſhes, deliquated or melted; for this ſtrikes back the Particles of every ſoluted thing whatſoever, and ſends them head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the bottom; to wit, foraſmuch, as it paſſes through every where, the little ſpaces of the ſolvent, and ſticking to the Contents, increaſes them in bulk, that they more eaſily fall out of the pores of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> bound alſo together with their own weight.</p>
                     <p>What fluid Salt (as Vinegar, Stygian waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) diſſolves, the ſame a fixed Salt precipitates; and on the contrary: becauſe Salt of Tartar being melted, moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently penetrates common Sulphur, and receives the Tincture; which then is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated by a fluid Salt, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Spirit of Vitriol, and the like: which indeed does not happen, by reaſon of the diſagreeing Particles of the Salts, and mutually oppoſing one another; but for that the ſame are greatly of kin, and ruſh into mutual Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: for from hence, the little grains of the thing ſoluted, by reaſon of the cohering of both the Salts together, being increaſed in bulk and weight, are more readily thruſt out of the little ſpaces of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and deſcend to the bottom. We will in this place, more ſparingly inſiſt upon inſtances of this nature, becauſe the more full hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them belongs to the Chymical Work.</p>
                     <p>Precipitation is not only obſerved in the ſeparation of a more thick matter, from a ſerous <hi>latex,</hi> and in the ſettling of the diſturbed parts towards the bottom; but ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Particles ſhut up within the pores and paſſages of the Liquor, are ſo ſmall and ſubtil, that being Precipitated, they are not diſcerned by the ſight, neither do they quickly deſcend to the bottom; but from their ſituation and poſition, being va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly changed, the colour, and conſiſtency of the Liquor, are diverſly altered. I was wont in times paſt, to ſport with the ſolutions of Vegetables and Minerals, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made by themſelves, were clear like Spring water, and appeared bright, being commixed, ſhewed now a Black colour, now a Milky, Red, Green, Blue, or ſome other kind. The ſolution of Saturn, (or Lead) being made with diſtilled Vinegar, appears bright like common water, if you add to this Oil of Tartar, like clear water, the mixture ſtraight grows White like Milk. If Antimony calcined with Nitre, be boiled in Spring water, the ſtraining ſeems clear, and almoſt without ſmell, which yet being daſhed by any Acid thing, preſently acquires a deep yellow colour, with a moſt wicked ſtink. Common water being imbued by an infuſion of Mercury Sublimate, is preſently tinged with yellowneſs, by Oyl of Tartar dropped into it. Quickſilver and Sal Armoniack, being beaten together, and Sublimated in a Matrace by the heat of Sand, go into a white powder, this being ſoluted by melting ſhows like to clear Spring
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:152521:32"/>
water, which yet being ſmeared upon Braſs or Copper, appears like Silver; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lightly rubbed on braſen Veſſels, renders them as if they were perfectly ſilvered. A ſolution of Calcined Tin, being put to melted Salt of Tartar becomes bluiſh. A clear infuſion of Galls, being mixt with a ſolution of Vitriol, makes Ink; if you add to this Spirit of Vitriol, or Stygian water, the black Liquor is by and by made clear like Spring water; and this Oil of Tartar reduces again to Ink. And what is more wonderful, if you write on Paper with the clear infuſion of Vitriol, and frame any Letters; what you ſo write preſently vaniſhes, nor is there any marks of the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters left: but if you ſmear over the Paper with an infuſion of Galls, preſently the Letters may be read, as if wrote with Ink; which yet, with a Pen run over, dipt in Spirit of Vitriol, you may put quite out at once wetting, and then again render them, with wetting them with another Liquor of Tartar. The Sky-colour Tincture of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, being daſhed with Oil of Vitriol, becomes of a Purple colour: to which, if you add ſome drops of the Spirit of Harts Horn, that Purple colour is changed into Green. Braſil Wood, being infuſed in common water, leaves a very pleaſant Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, like to Claret Wine; if you pour to this a little diſtilled Vinegar, the Liquor appears clear like White Wine: a few drops of Oil of Tartar reduces it to a deep Purple colour: then if the Spirit of Vitriol be poured in, it becomes of a pale yellow, like to Sack; if you add the Salt of Lead, being ſoluted by deliquation, the mixture grows preſently Milky: by this means you may imitate that famous Water-drinker, who having ſwallowed down a great deal of Spring water, was wont to vomit forth into Glaſſes placed before him, diverſly coloured Liquors, reſembling the ideas of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds of Wines: for Glaſſes being medicated with the aforeſaid Tinctures, (ſo lightly that they may not be perceived by the ſtanders by) will not only cauſe the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter poured into them, to imitate every Wine, but will exhibit the very Proteus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Poets, changed into waters, and from thence putting on all colours, and infinite forms.</p>
                     <p>If a Reaſon of theſe kind of appearances be asked, it ought to be fought in the minute Particles, contained within the pores of every Liquor; which as to their ſite and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being diverſly altered, by another Liquor infuſed, tranſmit variouſly the Rays of Light, many ways break or reflect them, and ſo make divers appearances of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. For when the Rays of Light paſs through almoſt in right Lines, they make a clear colour like Spring water; but it in their paſſage, they be a little broken, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor grows yellowiſh; but being more refracted, they cauſe a red colour; if they are bowed back, ſo as to be drained, or that they cannot ſhew themſelves, a dark or black colour ariſes; but if they are again reflected, to the outmoſt Superficies of the Liquor, they create the image of Whiteneſs: after this manner we might variouſly Philoſophiſe about other colours, and their appearances, the diverſity of which, and ſudden alterations in Liquids, depend chiefly on Precipitation: becauſe, as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles conteined in the Liquor, are driven ſomtimes more near by another infuſion that they claſp themſelves together; ſomtimes are ordered into other ſeries of poſitions, the diverſe repreſentation of colours is made. For Liquor being impregnated with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bodies or Atoms, or this Nature, moſt minutely broken, ſeems as an Army of Soldiers placed in their Ranks, who now draw into cloſe Order, now open their Files and Ranks, now turn to the left, now to the right hand, as is diverſly ſhown in the exerciſing of Tacticks, or the Art Military. When two clear Liquors being mixed together ſhall make Ink, it is becauſe the Particles conteined in either, approach near one another, and as it were placed in their cloſe Orders hinder the paſſage of the beams of light: when afterwards, this Ink is made clear by another Liquor poured in, it is becauſe the new Bodies of the thing put in, diſperſe abroad the former cloſe joyned Particles, and drive them as it were into their open Orders.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of the motion of Fermentation, as it is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Coagulation, and the Congelation of Bodies.</head>
                     <p>COagulation and Congelation of Natural Bodies, no leſs than their Solution, depend only on theſe our Principles. The improportionate mixture of theſe, and the exaltation, and powerfulneſs of ſome above others, are the cauſe of either. Spirit and Sulphur being looſned from the bond, do not only pull aſſunder the proper Subjects, but they ſet upon whatever is next them; and where they are mighty in number and ſtrength, they affect nothing more than divorces and ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the reſt of the Principles, and ſuffer no delay: but on the contrary, Salts love to be united to the reſt, and to be made into hard and ſolid ſubſtances; and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of the Company of the reſt, preſently to enter into new Friendſhips, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire only not to be joyned to any oppoſite. If at any time they are more impetuouſly moved, either by their own diſpoſition, or being ſoluted, they deſtroy the ſubſtance of others, this thing ſeems to be done for this end, deſtinated as it were by Nature, that they might find out Subjects agreeable to themſelves, and having through War ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Peace, they might at length be more ſtrictly united to them: wherefore when Saline <hi>Menſtruums</hi> corrode Stones or Metals, they are Coagulated with their Particles, and grow together into diverſly figured Cryſtals.</p>
                     <p>When we here treat of Coagulation, we do not take this word after the uſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: to wit, as it is wont to be vulgarly uſurped, when Milk is become congealed, that is, departs from its ſimple and equal Liquor into Heterogeneous ſubſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> Cheeſe, or Curds and Whey, or thick and thin; in like manner, when blood or other humors go into parts after that manner, they are ſaid to be coagulated: alſo, we have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where given this ſenſe, to this word, tho to ſpeak properly, theſe ſort of motions ought rather to be referred to Precipitation than to Coagulation. But here we would have to be underſtood, by the term Coagulation, an alteration in Bodies of the ſame kind, as when things at firſt tender and ſoft, grow hard, into a ſtiff, and as it were ſtony matter: or any thing is ſaid to coagulate, when Saline little Bodies being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed abroad in any Subject, begin to be congregated and joyned together, and from thence united, either among themſelves or with Earth, produce out of a ſoft and fluid ſubſtance, a hard and compacted. This may be perceived in the ſhells clearly ſtony, of Fruits and Seed; in Bones and Horns of living Creatures, in Shells and Shelly ſcurffs of Fiſhes; all which indeed very much abound with an Alcali Salt, or the ſame Volatilized. Among Handicrafts, or preparations from human Induſtry, the Cryſtaliſation, Vitrification of Salts, or making of Glaſs, alſo the baking of Pots and Earthen ware, ought to be referred to Coagulation.</p>
                     <p>But it is properly called Congelation, when the Saline Particles, coming from elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, ſtrictkly bind together the Subjects on which they fall, fix the Particles variouſly moved within the ſubſtance of the mixture, and gather them together, that by that means the whole becomes ſtiff, and as it were ſtony. We may behold theſe kind of effects in Ice and Froſt, by which ſoft Mud, or fluid Springs of waters grow ſtiff, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a very Marble ſubſtance. Alſo the ſame is manifeſtly beheld, among the Operations of Art, in the confuſions of ſome Salts, and mutual Concretion in Sublimating; by which means, they go into a ſubſtance, now like to Ice, now to Snow. To which may be added the Artificial turning of water to Ice, which is performed by the mixture of Salt and Snow; but the inſtances which we have remarked in either of theſe, about the Works of Art, we will in this place briefly run through, and a little conſider the reaſons of them, and the ways of being done.</p>
                     <p>The Cryſtaliſation of Salts, is procured after this manner; Salts of every kind are throughly diſſolved in common water, and their Particles being diſperſed through the whole maſs of the Liquor, wholly diſappear; afterwards, if this liquor be ſomwhat
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:152521:33"/>
evaporated, that its paſſages and pores be ſomthing bound together, the little Bodies of the Salt cloſe one with another, and mutually take hold of themſelves, and joyn together, the outward cold binding them, and are figured in the midſt of the water, into Cryſtals proper to their Nature. By this means <hi>Sal</hi> Nitre into Pyramids, Sea Salt into Cubes, Alum into eight cornered Figures, <hi>Sal</hi> Armoniack into ſix cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nered, and other Salts are formed into other Figures of their own accord, after a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant manner.</p>
                     <p>If the Reaſon of this be ſought after, we ſay that theſe kind of Salts are not ſimple Elements, but Bodies made up of abundance of Salt, with the other Elements mixed with them in ſmall quantity; which even as other Natural Concretes, are allotted by the firſt Creator, peculiar manners of figurations, according to the ſurpaſſing ſtrength of Salt and Spirit, and commixion with the reſt. For in determining the Figures of Natural Bodies, Spirit and Salt are as the Rule and Compaſs in deſcribing Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Figures: Spirit, as the moveable Foot of the Compaſs, or as a Penſil in the hand of an Artiſt, variouſly excurs and draws here and there diverſe faſhioned lineaments. But ſalt (as the applyed Rule) moderates the excurſions of the other, and determinates them, and reſtrains them within the confines deſigned by Nature: when the Spirit is more powerful than the Salt, there happens a greater variety in the Figuration of things, as in Vegetables and Animals; becauſe the Spirit running forth more largely, forms very many Marks of its Pourtracture, and deſcribes Bodies not in right Lines, but intorted, and very much variegated. Where the Salt Lords it over the Spirit, as in Mineral Concretes, and chiefly Saline; Bodies grow together in leſs adorned Figures, and are accounted the firſt and more ſimple, and of that ſort, as the Mathematical deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in right Lines or Circles. For thoſe Salts, are as it were ſecond Elements; and from the implanting of them in Bodies, the proper and native Figures of things, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much depend; and therefore they themſelves are primitively imbued by Nature with a certain Elementary Configuration, (ſo that according to <hi>Plato,</hi> God in truth exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes Geometry) and the firſt regular Figures are formed in the more ſimple, that things compounded of them, might ariſe furniſhed with all manner of variety of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</p>
                     <p>The fixed Salts of Herbs being prepared by Calcination, becauſe they are almoſt deſtitute of the Fellowſhip of Spirits, do ſcarce go at all into Cryſtals, nor are they coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, but by a long evaporation. Sea Salt containing a very little Spirit, with great Labour goes into Cubes. Next to this Alum, guifted with a little more Spirit, is more eaſily coagulated, and grows into more elaborate Figures, <hi>viz.</hi> eight cornered. <hi>Sal</hi> Nitre, ſwelling with ſpirit, is moſt eaſily coagulated, and is framed into a more perfect Figure, <hi>viz.</hi> Pyramidical; which conſiſts of both Spherical, and Right Lines. But Volatile Salt, (ſuch as is diſtilled out of Urine, Blood, and the Horns of living Creatures) being aſſociated with a plentiful Spirit, is drawn into Concretes, very much varying, which imitate now the Horns of Staggs, now the Figures of Plants. Out of Mercury, with Salt, or the Calx of Silver, by an Amalgama, in the midſt of the waters a Silver Tree is formed, with Stock, Trunk and Branches, painted to the Life. It is a uſual thing in the Winter time, for the Air, impregnated with Saline Vapors, and fallen on the Glaſs Windows, to be condenſed into moſt fair Figures of Trees and Woods. So much for the Cryſtalliſation of Salts: The other Species of Coagulation, is Vitrification, of which we will ſpeak next.</p>
                     <p>Vitrification (which is alſo ſaid to be the laſt mutation of Bodies, of which Nature is capable, and from which there is no going back) depends upon a fuſed Salt, and united to an Earthy matter, even to its ſmalleſt Particle: for when either matter is fuſed, by a moſt vehement fire, and divided in its ſmalleſt parts, the Bodies of either, being put into a Flux, are by ſo ſtrict a marriage joyned together, that afterwards they are never to be pulled aſſunder.</p>
                     <p>There are many ways, and diverſe proviſions of Vitrification, to wit, of <hi>Sal Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cali,</hi> with Sand or a ſandy matter fuſed together by a violent fire, common Glaſs is made; which is tranſparent, both by reaſon of the abundance of Salt, and of the clearneſs of the Sand; for if you behold the little Sands of which Glaſs is made, with a Microſcope, each of their little Globes appear, (as they were Glaſſie Gems) clear and ſhining. Wherefore Salt promotes the fuſion of that clear matter by fire, and then is admitted into its moſt ſtrict embraces being fuſed.</p>
                     <p>Beſides Glaſſes of diverſe Colours and Conſiſtences are made of Minium, the Calx of Tinn, Antimony, and ſome other Minerals, (when the Sulphureous part doth firſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:152521:33"/>
fly away) fuſed, now by themſelves, now with Flint or Sandy matter. The reaſon of all which conſiſts in this; that Salt and Earth, being moſt ſmally broken by a violent fuſion of fire, and being divided as to their leaſt Particles, catch hold of one another, and ſo are bound together, by the moſt ſtrict bond of the mixture. The Coalition or Coupling of theſe, is never to be diſſolved, becauſe there is wanting within in the mixture, other Principles, which might unlock the frame of the Subject: yea Salt and Earth, being joyned by the mediating fire, do ſo intimately cohere, that they affect not divorces of themſelves, nor ſuffer them from another.</p>
                     <p>The baking of Earthen Pots and Bricks, is of kin to Vitrification (or making of Glaſs) whereby moiſt and ſoft Clay is ſtifned into a very ſtony hardneſs: But in theſe, there is greater plenty of Earth, and leſs of Salt; wherefore they are leſs brittle, and not tranſparent. Concerning theſe we ſay, that by the fire mediating, and as it were handying the ſmalleſt, broken, and divided Particles of Salt, are married to every Particle of the Earthy matter, and with them grow hard, into as it were a ſtony ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and that not eaſily to be reſolved. Alſo in theſe kind of matters, prepared by human Induſtry, we imitate indeed, with an excellent Artifice, the Concretions of Bones and Stones, made by Nature in divers Families of Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals.</p>
                     <p>As to what reſpects Congelation; Salts of a diverſe kind, do often meet together, and grow ſtiff, into as it were a new ſubſtance: But this happens many ways. Of theſe, ſome Salts being mixed together, preſently grow together into Cryſtals: for the Acid Spirits of Minerals being added to the Salts of Tartar, or thoſe made of the inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Vegetables turn into a white Coagulum like Snow, and with a ſpumeous or frothy Heat: The reaſon of which is, that the Particles of the Salt, having gotten a Flux, take hold of other Salts in the Spirit, Alcaliſate by melting; but by reaſon of the firſt Particles of either, being made unlike, there ariſes a ſtrife; then from the ſame conſociated in one, that white ſettlement is made.</p>
                     <p>Not unlike the ſame manner, theſe Acetous Spirits, to wit, of Vitriol, Nitre, Salt, and others being mixed with Metals, while they corrode them, are Cryſtalliſed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Saline Particles: ſo the Spirits of Vitriol, Nitre, alſo Stygian waters, (which are only Salts having gotten a Flux) are formed into moſt elegant Cryſtals, in the diſſolving of Silver, Iron, Copper, and other things. For Salts, even as Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, being looſned from the mixture, diſſolve other mixtures, and greedily deſire to be united with the Homogeneous Particles of the ſame Subject.</p>
                     <p>There is another manner of Congelation, when Salts being mixed with ſome other matter, are elevated by Sublimation out of their Subjects, and then congeal the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of that new matter, which they carry away with them, and grow together with them (like a Meteor) on high: after this manner the Salts of Vitriol, Nitre and Sea-Salt, being ſublimated with Mercury, are congealed as it were into a ſnowy ſubſtance: The ſame being ſublimed with Antimony, go into a matter like Ice. After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Natural Congelations, by which ſome Minerals, and chiefly Vitriols and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs, are begot in the Bowels of the Earth, may be imitated. For of Iron and Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per are prepared factitious Vitriols, which are very like the Natural: Of Antimony Sulphur is made, which anſwers to an hair our common Sulphur in taking fire, colour and ſmell: for example pour Oyl of Vitriol, to the height of a fingers breadth, upon pulveriſed Antimony; and let it be diſtilled in a Retort in a Sand Furnace, a yellow Sulphur will be ſublimed in the Neck of the Retort, that cannot be diſcerned from the common Sulphur: which is a ſign that the Concretion of Sulphur is made in the Earth, when ſome Sulphureous Mineral is corroded by the Salt of Vitriol, whoſe Sulphureous parts are congealed by the ſame Salt. This alſo is an Argument, that Oyl of Sulphur, which is ſeparated, by inkindling under a Bell from the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous matter, is nothing elſe but Vitriolic Salt, nor doth any thing differ from Oyl of Vitriol.</p>
                     <p>Artificial Congelation concludes inſtances and examples of Congelations: to wit, whereby common water, or any Liquors being put over the fire, or in an Hot Houſe, are ſuddenly congealed into Ice: 'tis a common way, and vulgarly known, Salt being mixed with Snow and Ice, and agitated or ſhaken in a Veſſel put into water, ſuddenly the water about the ſides of the Veſſel will be frozen. This will be done if you make tryal of it, either with common Salt, or Sea-Salt, Nitre, or alſo with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, Alum, <hi>Sal</hi> Armoniac, or Mercury Sublimate: For Salt of every kind, being put to Snow or Ice, looſens their mixtures, and ſends away the Nitrous and Conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152521:34"/>
Particles from the Subjects; which preſently being immerſed in the neighbouring water, Congeal it, as if they were freſhly blown from the North.</p>
                     <p>What is more admirable; let a diſh with Snow be placed over hot Coals, and in the middle of the Snow put a Glaſs full of water: as the Snow is melted by degrees by the fire, the water ſhall be frozen: for the Nitrous Particles, being driven away by the heat, by their departure, they are daſhed againſt the neighbouring water and congeal it.</p>
                     <p>And thus much for FERMENTATION in general, and briefly of its various parts; it had been almoſt an infinite Labour, and from our purpoſe, to heap up inſtances in ſo diffuſe a thing. Thoſe hitherto brought, however choſen out of Natural Philoſophy, were fit to wait upon the following Medical diſſertation, that we may more happily know the Original, Progreſs, and State, as alſo the Remedies and Cure of Motions, and Mutations, in Cauſes, which variouſly happen to all kind of Bodies, and ſomwhat reſpecting the Tumults, which from thence are begot in the human Body, from the blood being irritated, and the reſt of the humors; to which exerciſe, God willing, we will now proceed.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O Inſtitute in this Age a new Doctrine of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, may perhaps ſeem the ſame thing, as if any one ſhould go about to deſcribe the midſt of our Country, for a Land before unknown. For what reſpect the <hi>Diagnoſis</hi> of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, ſeem to be firmly Eſtabliſhed already, by the Precepts and Practice of the Antients and Moderns; yea by long Experience, they are ſo generally in the mouth, and known of all men, that nothing can be more. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I deſerve pardon, if I a little receed from the Vulgar Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning Feavers, as a way mightily worn out; and go in a leſs trodden Path; becauſe I am not the firſt, or only man that directs his courſe againſt the received Opinion, as againſt a Stream. For in truth, in the Medical Art, (and that deſervedly) thoſe things have not pleaſed the men of our Age, which did thoſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: becauſe the Antients relying on a falſe Poſition concerning the motion of the Blood, proceeding as it were through ſlippery and moiſt places, often fell foully and dangerouſly: wherefore it is no wonder, if thoſe who come after ſhould take care for the thorough inſtauration of Phyſick, and for the Re-Edifying the Building, (as they ſay) even from the ground, the Antient Props being fallen down, on that which our moſt Famous <hi>Harvy</hi> hath laid, the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, as a new Foundation in Medicine. But in this Work, Learned men of other Countrys, but chiefly of our own, have happily laboured, not only in removing the Rubbiſh of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Building, but for the ſupplying this plentifully with Stone, Planks, and other matter. In times paſt, among the Antients, as the diſtribution and Natural motion, of the Nutritious humor, of the Blood and Nervous juice; ſo the Feaveriſh heats, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural motions of them, were wholly hidden and lay in the dark: but now new Lights have ſhined forth, and it is granted us to know the Cauſes of things before hidden, it doth not become pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent men, and profeſsing Philoſophy, even to ſhut their Eyes and remain blind in the Light it ſelf; but eſpecially about a Diſeaſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:152521:35"/>
by which the third part of Mortals have ſtill fallen to this day, to be rather willing to Err with the Antients, than to underſtand the Truth with the Moderns, or to believe what is more likely, argues a mind guilty of notable ſtubbornneſs. When therefore the Puretology or Feaver Tracts of former Medicine, had no firm and ſtable Baſis, and that it is eaſie to ſhew that it was built upon very many, and plainly falſe Errors, what ſhould hinder, but that we having gotten more certain Principles, ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to erect a better Science concerning Feavers? Truly I think it would hardly be, altho the pleas of the Antients, ſhould be yet openly maintained in the Schools, but that many Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who have a mind to look within the Bark, would frame new Hypotheſes to themſelves from their own Ratiocination, by which they might more exactly quadrate the Phaenomena of Feavers, than by that of the Antients. But it may be objected, that Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have been happily cured by the ſame Remedies, and the like method of Curing, from the times of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> even to our days; and therefore it may ſeem a raſh Work and little ſafe, that we ſhould endeavour new things, after having had the Experience of ſo many Ages, eſpecially ſince it is about the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Body. To this it will be eaſie to anſwer, that Medicine was at firſt Empirical, and Remedies were not invented by general Precepts, or by Rule, but by the frequent trial of ſeveral things: And if led by the Example of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> his Followers had only poliſhed his Obſervations and Experiments, without doubt the Medicinal Art had grown up better, more handſomly, and with greater benefit to the Sick. But that the Light, clearly inkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Antients, did ſo ſuddenly ſhut up, and darkned the Eyes of Poſterity, it was, the prepoſterous ſtudy of thoſe, who too baſtily framed, almoſt out of their own Brain, Phyſick into a general Method, after the manner of ſome Speculative Science: for by this means, before they had laid a firm Foundation, a ſufficiently ſpecious, and deceitful Pile of unſtable Doctrine, was erected. That therefore in the Cure of Feavers, ſome Indications being more antiently received, remain yet confirmed, and are to be perpetually obſerved, is to be aſcribed wholly to Experience, the firſt Miſtreſs of this Art, and not to the Precepts of Scholars. And from hence, I hope for my ſelf, to have gotten a defence ſufficient enough; for if the Opinions wholly erronious of the Antients, had not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, but that the practice of Medicine, at firſt inſtituted by a certain induction of obſervations; had proceeded commodiouſly enough; the Theory being joyned with Truth, would have brought much leſs hurt to the Sick; or have leſs carried away thoſe exerciſing Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:152521:35"/>
quite contrary from that Path, which Antiquity had left com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us. In the mean time, 'tis not to be diſſembled, that naked Experience, without the helps of Method and Reaſon avails little, yea very often doth much hurt; for neither are the ſame Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, every where to be driven away by the ſame Remedies. But he ſeems to have hit the mark, who joyns both together, that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may not pervert Experiments, and Nature it ſelf, not that this may remove Reaſon from its place. Altho that I know well enough, I have not obtained it, yet I will freely profeſs, that I have aimed at this Mark; and perhaps I may have deſerved ſome praiſe, even in failing in theſe ſort of Adventures; for after I had not found in Books, what might ſatisfie a mind deſirous of Truth, I reſolved with my ſelf, to ſearch into living and breathing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: and therefore ſitting oftentimes by the Sick, I was wont carefully to ſearch out their Caſes, to weigh all the ſymptoms, and to put them, with exact Diaries of the Diſeaſes, into writing; then diligently to meditate on theſe, and to compare ſome with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and then began to adapt general Notions from particular Events: and when by this means, for a long time, obſerving the Accidents and Courſes of Feavers, I had buſied my ſelf, for the finding out forms of Reaſons for their Cure, at length a new Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thology of this Diſeaſe was conceived in my mind; which afterwards, by the frequent increaſing Concourſe of Obſervations, as it were the Juice and Blood, was formed by degrees into a Child, ſuch as it now appears. But the Infant, which I had ordered to be kept cloſely, in our private houſe, being remarkable for Paradoxes, as it were a monſtrous ſhape, the importune diligence of Friends has taken care to bring abroad being gotten forth of my hands, and to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly beheld. What therefore is there ſaid concerning Feavers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the common manner, I would not have any one eſteem it brought forth by me, as from a Doctor in the Chair: doubting, I bring theſe thoughts into Public, and ſubmit them to the Examination and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the more Learned. That others before me have not ſpoken all things truly concerning this thing, ſhall be an Argument that I may Err, yea (if you pleaſe) that I have Erred: however, if I ſhould have rightly traced forth any marks, in this, at leaſt new ſearch of Truth; and ſhall have incited others (who are far better able) by this occaſion, to the full finiſhing of it; it will not repent me altogether of this, tho raſh beginning.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Doctrine of Fermentation being explicated, it remains that we handle the chief Inſtance or Example of it, to wit <hi>Feavers.</hi> For it ſeems that a Feaver is only a Fermentation, or immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Heat, brought into the blood and humors. Its name is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Februo</hi> (or <hi>Purgament,</hi> which alſo is derived from <hi>Ferveo</hi> to be Hot) which word indeed is commodiouſly put to every Feaver, for that the blood in this Diſeaſe grows hot, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, by its fervor, as working muſt, it is Purged from its fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſes. But that this Fermentation or Feaveriſh efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, may be rightly explicated, theſe three things are to be conſidered. Firſt, What the Fermenting Liquor is; whether only blood, or any humors beſides. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, In what Principles in the mixture, and in what proportion of them, this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor conſiſts. Thirdly and laſtly, By what motion and turgeſcency of thoſe parts, or Particles, of which the blood is made, the Feaveriſh efferveſcency is ſtirred up. Theſe being thus premiſed, the Doctrin of Feavers ſhall be delivered, not from the Opinions of others, but acccording to the compariſons of Reaſons, picked (tho from ours, yet) from diligent and frequent obſervation, and confirmed by certain Experiments; all which however, I willingly ſubmit to the judgment of the more skilful.</p>
                     <p>It plainly appears, even to the ſenſe, that the Blood doth hugely boil up and rage in a Feaver, for every one (tho rude and unskilful) being in a Feaver, complains of the blood being diſtempered, and of the ſame growing hot in the Veſſels, and as it were put into a fury. Alſo, beſides the blood raging in the Veins and Arteries, it may be lawfully ſuſpected, that that juice with which the Brain and Nervous parts are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, is wont oftentimes to be in fault; for when this Liquor is ſeen to be carried back from the blood, into the Nervous ſtock by a conſtant motion, and certain Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and from thence through the Lymphatick Veſſels, into the Boſom of the blood, it is probable, if by reaſon of a taint contracted from the blood, that humor be depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in its diſpoſition, or is perverted from its equal motion, that from thence, the Rigor, and Pain, Convulſion, Delirium, Phrenſie, and many more ſymptoms of the Nervous kind, uſual in Feavers, do ariſe.</p>
                     <p>After the Blood and Nervous Liquor, two other humors, for that being apt to grow hot, fall into our conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> The Chyme or nouriſhing Juice, continually coming to the Maſs of Blood, and the ſerous Latex, perpetually departing from the ſame, which tho they be the firſt and laſt Liquors ſeparated from the Blood, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from it, yet being confuſed with it, they ought to be eſteemed as its aſſociate parts, or complements: For the nouriſhable Juice being freſh brought, is accounted the crude part of the blood, and to be aſſimilated; and the <hi>Serum,</hi> its ſtale part, and to be carried away. And after this manner, ſo long as either are Circulated with the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:152521:37"/>
blood it ſelf, in the Veſſels they participate of the heats of the firſt begotten blood, and oftentimes occaſionally begin them, or increaſe them being begun: but by what means theſe things come to be done, is declared hereafter in their proper places. As to the reſt of humors, which are only the recrements of the Nutritious juice, or the blood, when they are included, either in their proper Receptacles, or conſtrained in the narrow ſpaces, in the Viſcera, neither waſh the ſeveral parts of the Body with a continual luſtration, as the blood or Nervous Liquor, or the other humors but now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, are to be exempted from this rank; ſomtimes perhaps they may be the occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſe that the blood doth conceive an undue Efferveſcency, or that it perſiſts in it longer; but it is only the blood, (with the Nervous Liquor, the alible juice, and <hi>Serum</hi> aſſociates) which boiling up above meaſure, with its heat, and ſtirred up with a rage through the Veſſels, diffuſes the preternatural heat, and induces the formal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Feaver: but how this comes to be done, is not to be known plainly, but by a more near beholding the Nature of Blood, and as it were an Anatomy made of its Liquor.</p>
                     <p>There are in the Blood (as in all Fermentative Liquors) Heterogeneous Particles which as they are of a diverſe Figure and Energy, remain a long while in the mixture, by their mutual oppoſing one another and ſubaction, the motion of Fermentation is continually conſerved; as is perceived in Wine, Beer, and other Liquors: then, if the mixtion of the Liquor be ſomwhat unlocked by the adding of Ferments, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Particles being freed from their bonds, do yet more ſwell up and induce Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, with a more rapid motion and heat: which is ſeen in a familiar Experiment of the Chymiſts, <hi>viz.</hi> when fluid Salts are mixed with Saline Liquors of another kind; from thence a great heat and ebullition are ſtirred up. Wherefore we ought to inquire concerning the Blood, of what Particles it conſiſts, that it ſhould be fit to Ferment, (as Wine, Beer, and other Liquors) of its own Nature: then by the help of what kind of Ferments, both its Natural and Feaveriſh heats are performed, with warmth, and a more quick motion.</p>
                     <p>The Maſs of the Blood by the opinion of the Antients, was thought to conſiſt of four humors, to wit, Blood, Phlegm, Choler and Melancholy: and it was affirmed, that according to the eminency of this, or that humor, diverſe temperaments are formed; and that by reaſon of their fervors or exorbitances, almoſt all Diſeaſes do ariſe. This Opinion, tho it flouriſhed from the time of <hi>Galen,</hi> in the Schools of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, yet in our Age, in which the Circular motion of the Blood, and other affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it were made known, before not underſtood, it began to be a little ſuſpected; nor to be ſo generally made uſe of, for the ſolving the Phaenomenas of Diſeaſes: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe ſort of humors do not conſtitute the blood, but what are ſo called (except the Blood) are only the recrements of the blood, which ought continually to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it: For in truth the Blood is an only humor; not one thing about the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera, and another in the habit of the Body; nor is it moved at one time by Phlegm, and another time with Choler, or Melancholy, (as is commonly aſſerted) but the Liquor growing hot in the Veſſels, is only Blood, and whereſoever it is carried through all the parts of the Body, it is ſtill the ſame, and like it ſelf. But becauſe by reaſon of the abundance of the implanted heat in ſome, and becauſe of the ſmalneſs of it in others, the Coction of the Aliment is now quicker, now ſlower performed in the Bowels, and in the Veſſels; therefore the temper of the Blood (tho but one, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame Liquor) becomes diverſe: and according to the various diſpoſition of this, it may be ſaid that men are Choleric, Melancholic, or of another temperament. Beſides, becauſe whilſt the Blood is made in its Circulation in the Veſſels, ſome parts continually grow Old, and others are ſupplied anew, hence from Crudity, or too much Coction, there is a neceſſity that what is excrementitious ſhould be heaped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which notwithſtanding by its efferveſcency, (as by the working or depuration of Wines it comes to paſs) it is ſeparated from its Maſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the watry humor, fixed in the Bowels, or ſolid parts, is it which is called Phlegm: ſome Reliques of aduſt Salt and Sulphur, being ſeparated in the Liver, and received by the Choleduct Veſſels are called Choler; the Earthy feculences being laid up in the Spleen, are termed Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. In the mean time, the Blood if rightly purified ought to want Choler, Phlegm and Melancholy: even as when ſome Wines, or Beer are purified, the more light Particles are carried upwards, which conſtitute its Flowers or Head; and the dregs are preſt down to the bottom, which grow together into Feces or Tartar: yet none can truly ſay it, Wine or Beer is compoſed of Froth, Tartar, and a Vinous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:152521:37"/>
But as theſe humors, commonly ſo called, are made out of the other Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>viz.</hi> Choler out of Salt and Sulphur, with an admixtion of Spirit and Water; and Melancholy, out of the ſame, with an addition of Earth; and as the blood is immediately forged out of theſe kind of Principles, and is wont to be reſolved ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly into the ſame, I thought beſt, the common acception of humors being laid aſide, to bring into uſe theſe celebrated Principles of the Chymiſts, for the unfolding the Nature of the Blood and its affections. There are therefore in the blood as in all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, apt to be Fermented, very much of Water and Spirit, a mean of Salt and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and a little of Earth. The blood being looſned by putrefaction, exhibits the ſame ſeparated and diſtinct. Alſo in the blood contained in the Veſſels, or being freſh let out from them, we may diſcover their energies and effects: beſides when in the Food, whereby we are fed, by the juice of which the Liquor of the blood is made, theſe ſame are implanted, no man will go about to deny that the blood alſo is made from them: wherefore I will briefly run through theſe, and endeavour to ſhew by what means the Conſiſtency, the Properties, and the Affections of the Blood are made by them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Spirits (which readily obtain the chief place) are a ſubtil, and greatly vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile portion of the blood. Their Particles, always expanſed, and endeavouring to fly away do move about the more thick little Bodies of the reſt, wherewith they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, and continually detein them in the motion of Fermentation. The Liquor of the blood, continually boils up with their efferveſcency or growing hot and equal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion in the Veſſels, and the reſt of the Principles are contained in an orderly moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and within the bond of the exact mixture; if any Heterogeneous thing, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreable to the mixture, be poured into the bloody Maſs, preſently the Spirits being diſturbed in their motion rage, ſhake the blood, and force it to grow hugely hot, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til what is extraneous, and not miſſible, is either ſubdued, and reduced, or caſt out of doors. By the irradiation, or rather the irrigation or watering of theſe, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Nerves are inflated, the Functions of the Viſcera, and alſo the Offices of motion, and ſenſation are performed: from the want of Spirits alſo from their motion being depraved or hindred, ariſe great vices of the Natural oeconomy or Government. The more quick motion and efferveſcency of theſe in the blood, (above what is in Wine) chiefly depends upon the Ferment of the Heart; becauſe, whilſt the blood paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes through the Boſom of the Heart, its mixture is very much looſned, ſo that the Spirits, together with the Sulphureous Particles, being ſomwhat looſned, and as it were inkindled into a flame, leap forth, and are much expanded, and from thence they impart by their deflagration, a heat to the whole. By reaſon of this kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion and ſuffuſion of heat, there is made a continual expence of Spirits, which being rarified, as it were inkindled, continually fly away, and are evaporated forth a doors: and as long as we live there is made a continual reparation of theſe by ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, chiefly the moſt delicate; which contain in themſelves very much of Spirit and ſwelling matter: from which juice being drawn by digeſtion, and collated to the blood, is aſſimilated to it and fills up its defects. When the Blood of Animals is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled, the Spirits (like <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi>) aſcend of a limpid colour, they are made very ſharp and pricking by the adheſion of the Salt; yet they are not ſo eaſily drawn off as the Spirits of Wine, but that there is need of a more intenſe fire to force them, becauſe they are hardly driven from the fellowſhip of the thicker parts, with which they are involved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That there is plenty of Sulphur in the blood, it is plainly ſeen, becauſe we are chiefly fed with Fat and Sulphureous Aliments, alſo the Nutriment from the blood, carried to the ſolid parts, goes into Sulphur and Fatneſs. It is moſt likely, from the diſſolution of this, that the red Tincture of the Blood doth ariſe: for Sulphureous Bodies; before any others, impart to the ſolvent <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> a colour highly full of redneſs; and when by reaſon of too great Crudity, the Sulphur is leſs diſſolved, the blood becomes watery and pale, that it will ſcarce dye a Linnen ragg red. The Maſs of blood being impregnated with Sulphur, and together with Spirits, it becomes very Fermentable: which however, whilſt it enters the Ventricles of the Heart, there ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers a greater efferveſcency, or rather accenſion; and on the Particles chiefly Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, being inflamed; and thence diffuſed through the whole, the lively and vital heat in us depends. When the Sulphureous part is carried forth, and doth too much lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriate
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:152521:38"/>
in the blood, it perverts its diſpoſition from its due ſtate, that therefore the blood being either depraved, or made more bilous or Cholerick, doth not rightly Cook the nouriſhing juice; or being inkindled throughout, it conceives heats and ardours ſuch as ariſe in a continual Feaver. For the Sulphur being too much exalted; and ſwelling more than it ought, ſtirs up great heats in the blood: and they whoſe blood is more plentifully impregnated with Sulphur, are moſt obnoxious to Feavers. By reaſon of the Particles of this being incocted with the Nutritious juice, and from thence car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the ſolid parts, fatneſs, ſoftneſs and tenderneſs, come to our Body. From the Fleſh or Blood putrefying, by reaſon of the abundance of evaporated Sulphur, a moſt evil ſtink breaths forth: In the diſtillation of Blood, Sulphur aſcends under the form of a blackiſh Oyl, which alſo by reaſon of the Empyreuma, ſtinks moſt wickedly.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That Salt is in the blood, is evinced by the Salt; which, tho fixed, is drawn forth, by being eaten, from Vegetables, and from other eatable things, at firſt leſs volatile, afterwards by the moſt excellent digeſtion of Nature, and Circulation, is highly volatiliſed; that it paſſes through, not only without a remaining <hi>Caput Mortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> all the members and parts of our Body, but alſo the blood being expoſed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation, aſcends the Alembic, and leaves the dead Head as inſipid earth: If at any time the Saline Particles are not rightly exalted in the Blood, by reaſon of ill digeſtion, but remain crude, and for the moſt part fixed, from thence the blood becomes thick and unfit for Circulation, ſo that obſtructions are begot in the bowels and ſolid parts, and ſerous Crudities are every where heaped together: But if the Salt be too much carried forth, and ſuffers a Flux, the Spirit being depreſſed, or deficient, a ſour and bitter diſpoſition is given to the blood, ſuch as is obſerved in Scorbutical people, and thoſe ſick of a Quartan Feaver. Alſo from the Salt, for this reaſon being vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly coagulated, the Stone, Kings-Evil, Gout, Leproſie, and very many other Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Diſeaſes ariſe. But when Coction being rightly performed in the bowels and Veſſels, the Salt is duly exalted, and being aſſociated with the Spirit, is volatiliſed, then by reaſon of its mixture, the Liquor of the blood more equally ferments; alſo is defended from Putrefaction, Stagnation and Coagulation: Alſo the Saline Particles, bridle the fierceneſſes of the Spirits, and eſpecially of Sulphur; wherefore, thoſe who have their blood well filled with a Volatile Salt, are leſs obnoxious to Feavers: alſo hence thoſe who often are let blood, are more apt to Feavers.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Beſides, There are in the blood (as it is a thick humour, and hath a groſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence) many Earthy Particles: from hence alſo, its too great Volatiliſation is as it were ſupported, and its too haſty accenſion hindered: even as Charcoal-duſt, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded oftentimes to Gun-Powder in a greater proportion, that all its parts may not take fire at once, and too ſoon. Further, from the Terreſtrial Particles of the blood, and Nutritious Juice, the bulk and increaſe of the Body proceeds. Laſtly from the diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, a light and friable <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> is left in great plenty.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Upon the watery part of the blood depends its fluidneſs; for from hence its ſtagnation is hindered, and the blood is circulated in the Veſſels, without growing thick or ſtiff: alſo its too great conflagration, and aduſtion is reſtrained, and its heat attempered. When blood is diſtilled a clear and inſipid water is drawn off, at leaſt in a double proportion to the reſt; for from hence the matter of Urine, Sweat, and every humid Excrement, for the moſt part proceeds.</p>
                     <p>What things were but now aſſerted, concerning the Principles of the blood, and the affections to be deduced thence, will better appear, if we conſider conſider a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the blood according to its ſenſible parts, and ſhall compare it with other Liquors which are in dayly uſe among us. Thoſe ſort of Liquors, which have a very great Analogy with the blood, are <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>z.</hi> Rich Wine and Milk. As to the reaſons of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and growing Hot, it is moſt fitly compared to Wine; as to its conſiſtency, coagulation, and departure of the parts one from another, it is likened to Milk.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place therefore, it is obſerved of Wine, that ſo long as it is ſhut up in the Veſſel or Pipe, its ſubtil and ſpirituous Particles, do perpetually agitate, or very much ſhake others more thick, break them, and render them fit for an exact mixtion; what is heterogeneous, and unfit for ſubaction or mingling, is ſeparated by its grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot: In the mean time the purified Liquor greatly fermenting is in perpetual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:152521:38"/>
whereby all the parts (as Atoms variouſly moved up and down, in a beam or ſtreak of light) do ſtretch themſelves forth on every ſide, and contend with a conſtant rowling about, from top to bottom, and from thence to the top again. By the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and refraction of the Particles very many <hi>Effluvia</hi> of Atoms, go away from the Liquor, which if the Veſſel being cloſely ſhut, they are kept within; the Liquor grows too exceſſively hot, and oftentimes cauſes the containing Veſſel to burſt in pieces. Blood, much after the ſame manner being ſhut up within the Veins and the Arteries, is urged with a conſtant Circulation: The Vital Spirit makes ſubtil, breaks, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly molds the more thick Particles; what is heterogeneous, and not mixable, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels forth of doors; in the mean time by the refraction and kneading of the parts, <hi>Effluvia</hi> of heat do conſtantly ſtream forth, and evaporate through the pores; which being ſhut in, if tranſpiration be hindred, preſently by reaſon of the too great boyling of the blood a Feaver is inkindled.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we will obſerve concerning Wines, that they grow turgid, or ſwell up, if any extraneous thing, and of a Fermentative Nature, be poured to them; yea ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that they are moved more than ordinary of their own accord. For, when by a long digeſtion, the Sulphureous part of the Wine is too much exalted, it conceives a greater heat than it ought, and (unleſs preſently appeaſed) perverts the diſpoſition of the whole Liquor, with its ſwelling up. It ſeems to be for the very like reaſon, that the Feaveriſh heat which is wont to be introduced by reaſon of the ſame Cauſes, is ſtirred up in the blood, as ſhall be ſhown in the next Chapter, where we treat of the Motion and Heat of the blood.</p>
                     <p>The third Obſervation, or comparing of the Blood with Wine, ſhall be of this ſort: Wines (as alſo many other Liquors, as for example, Beer, or Sider) have their times of crudity, maturation, and defection. For when they are firſt made, the Spirituous parts are ſo obvolved by the others more thick, that they ſhew themſelves but little, and put forth almoſt nothing of ſtrength or virtue: and as the other Particles, are not yet ſubtiliſed, nor truly concocted, the whole Liquor remains crude, and of an ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful taſt; and if put to diſtillation, not any Spirit aſcends. From this ſtate it comes by degrees to perfection, and when the Spirits being extricated from their intangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, obtain their own right, and have ſubtilized and exalted the more thick Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the reſt, the whole maſs of the Liquor becomes Clear, Spirituous, Sweet and Balſamick. Laſtly, when by a long Fermentation, the Spirits are conſumed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at length to fail, the ſtate of defection is induced, whereby Wines, and other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, either paſs into a taſtleſneſs, or at laſt the Salt and the Sulphur being too much exalted, are made ſowr or unſavory. In like manner the blood alſo, while it is Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the Veſſels, may be conſidered according to this kind of threefold diſpoſition: Firſt, in the making or crudity, which has relation to the Chyme new made in the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and freſhly poured to the blood; the Particles of which, like to unripe Fruit, are crude and undigeſted. Secondly, In the perfect ſtate or maturation, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the blood being ſufficiently wrought, and made Volatile, according to all its Particles after it is inſpired by Ferments, and its inkindling in the heart exalted. Thirdly, in its defection, which reſpects the blood; after it hath burned forth, and its Spirituous parts are very much flown away, and the reſt growing old and poor, have need to be removed; and ſo they are either the Reliques of Salt, which are with the <hi>Serum</hi> ſtrained forth continually by the Urine; or they are Particles of Salt and Sulphur, boyled and baked together, which are ſtrained forth by the virtue of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into the choleduct Veſſels: or laſtly, they are dregs and earthy recrements of the blood it ſelf, which are carried into the Spleen, and there (as it were a <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> exalted by a new digeſtion) go into a Ferment, at length to be tranſmitted to the blood. Whilſt after this manner, the generation of the blood, and its due maturation are truly diſpatched, it is pleaſingly circulated within the Veſſels, neither wanting in motion or heat, nor inordinately troubled with them. But if either the ſupplement of the nouriſhing Juice, be not made agreeable with the reſt of the blood, nor aſſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, but that either by reaſon of the defect of Concoction, it is waſhed into a very crude humor, or becauſe of its exceſs, it is roſted into a burnt matter; or if the blood growing old, does not lay aſide what it caſts off, and give way to a new Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious humor; I ſay, by reaſon of theſe kind of Vices, concerning Sanguification, or the making of blood, the blood is variouſly perverted from its due temper and equal motion, and now becomes Watery and Cold; now Sharp or Salt; now Acid, Auſtere, or by ſome other way degenerate, and ſomtimes obnoxious to ſtagnations, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes alſo to immoderate heats.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:152521:39"/>We may obſerve theſe kind of degrees of crudity, coction, and defection, in the blood, both of the ſound and of the ſick: in healthful perſons after a more plentiful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, Surfeit, or hard drinking, when too much of <hi>Serum</hi> or of Juice, is poured to the blood, its whole maſs being too much diluted with a crude humor, becomes more watery and leſs ſpirituous; wherefore men are rendered ſluggiſh, and unfit for moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or exerciſe. In ſick perſons the Phlegmatic Conſtitution of the Body, induces ſuch a crudity of the bloody maſs, as is diſcerned in the White Dropſie, the Dropſie, <hi>Pica</hi> or longing Diſeaſe, and the <hi>Chloroſis</hi> or Green-ſickneſs. Alſo the ſtate of this kind of crudity, comes in an intermitting Feaver, and in truth is the cauſe of the Feaveriſh acceſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> by reaſon of the dyſcraſie of the blood; the nouriſhing Juice being heaped up, is not aſſimilated to it, but for the moſt part goes into a crude, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe degenerate matter; with which, when the maſs of the blood is filled to a pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſwelling up it brings on the fit.</p>
                     <p>The ſtate of Maturation, Concoction being finiſhed, happens in healthful perſons, ſome hours after Eating, eſpecially in the morning, to wit, when the ſupplement of the Chyme, is ſpiritualiſed, and as it were enkindled in the whole, by reiterated Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations: for then men are made more nimble and lively, and more ready for ſtudies, or any buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>The ſtate of Defection, is in the blood of ſound men after faſting long, hard labor, and want of Food, for then the Vital Spirit being very much evaporated, the maſs of the blood begins to become as it were lifeleſs, wherefore they preſently languiſh, and are made weak. Moreover, the blood by a too long Coction is burned, and grows bilous, from whence thoſe accuſtomed to want Food, or faſting, for the moſt part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſad and melancholic. Some Diſeaſes habitually induce ſuch a diſpoſition of the blood; ſuch are the Scurvy, the Yellow Jaundies, the Cachexia (or evil ſtate of the Body when the nouriſhing Juice turns to ill humours) long Feavers, and moſt Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Diſeaſes, in which, the whole maſs of blood, paſſes from from a Spirituous, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to either a ſowr, ſharp, or auſtere Nature.</p>
                     <p>So much for the comparing of Blood with rich Wine; what follows, being a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of it with Milk, conſiſts in the diverſity of the parts, and their ſetling apart, which is chiefly ſeen in its being let forth from the Veins, and grown cold in the diſh. For when the heat and vital Spirit, which conſerve all things in the mixture, are flown away, the remaining parts, depart from one another of themſelves, and a ſeparation of the thin from the thick, and of the <hi>Serum</hi> from the Fibrous blood is made. This ſort of ſeparation of the parts, ſucceeds almoſt after the ſame manner, as in the coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of Milk. There are in Milk, Buttery, Cheeſie parts, and Whey. The like is in Blood, ſo long as it doth not much recede from its Natural temper: for it is good, when, being let forth of the Veins, it grows cold in the Porringer, its parts do ſettle after the ſame manner; to wit, the more pure portion, and Sulphureous (like Cream) comes together on the Superficies, which in healthful people, looks brightly red, and this anſwers to the flowring, or head of the Milk: under this lies a Purple thick ſubſtance, which coſiſts of little Thrids and Fibres joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and as it were concreted into a clotty ſubſtance or parenchyma, ſuch as the Liver: For the heat being conſumed, and the bond of the mixture loſened, the Fibrous parts lay hold on one another, and by their weight, ſettle into a more thick Coagulum, which anſwers to the Cheeſie part of the Milk: In the mean time, the Serous or Wheyey parts, being thruſt forth from the reſt, get their own Nature, and conſtitute a clear Liquor, like water; which as it is thinner, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends to the top, and ſwims upon the reſt. Further, as the Whey of Milk is wont to be further coagulated, and doth yet contain in it ſelf ſome parts both Buttery and Cheeſie, ſo this Liquor ſwiming on the blood, if it be expoſed either to the fire, grows thick, like the White of an Egg a little roſted, or if an Acid Liquor be poured to it, will be precipitated into a white Coagulum. This being ſeen, ſome have thought this watery Latex, to be the nouriſhing juice, which imparts nouriſhment to the whole Body, from the maſs of the blood, in the time of its Circulation, and that the reſt of the blood, is only the Vehicle of Heat and Spirits, and ſerves for no other uſe. But to me it ſeems more likely, that in this watery Liquor is contained the nouriſhing juice, which is imployed on the Nerves, and the commonly termed Spermatic parts, for nouriſhment is ſupplyed to the Muſculous ſtock, from the Fibrous blood of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchyma, or the Liver, Lights, and Milt. After this manner, blood being not much vitiated, goes into parts like Milk; but if it be exceedingly depraved, when it ſettles,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:152521:39"/>
it ſhews a far different diſpoſition, and as to its ſingle Contents, is allotted into various appearances; for the Cream growing together on the top, is ſeen to be ſomtimes white, ſomtimes green, now yellow, or of livid or lead colour: alſo it becomes not tender, but very viſcous or clammy, that like a Membrane, it can ſcarce be pulled in pieces. When the blood long growing hot with a Feaveriſh diſtemper, is let forth from the cut Vein, in its Superficies, inſtead of a Scarlet Cream, there grows together often a white skin, or of ſome other colour: the reaſon of which is, becauſe the blood is throughly roſted, by too great Ebullition, and its more pure portion, as it were by a certain elixation, is boiled forth from a red and tender ſubſtance, to a white and tough; but if in the mean time the bloody maſs be not ſufficiently purged from the aduſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of Salt and Sulphur, the colour of this little skin becomes yellow or livid, and therefore the water ſwimming over it, is often tinged by the ſame means. Further, the Purple Craſſament or thick ſubſtance, is alſo various: <hi>viz.</hi> ſomtimes it is of a blackiſh colour, when the blood is ſcorched too much, by a long efferveſency. When the Fibres are vitiated, as in the Liver, they grow not together, but the Liquor like Beaſting Milk, remains ſomwhat thick, and yet fluid; which indeed argues a great corruption of the blood; as uſes to happen, in a putrid Feaver, a very great Cachexy, ſomtimes the watery Latex is wanting, as in Hectical people, and in too great a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreſis. Somtimes it ſuperabounds, as in Dropical people, neither will the whole go into a white Coagulum, by heat: In ſome Cachectical people, the blood being made more watery, appears like watered fleſh. I knew one, indued with a vicious habit of body, that was wont to have blood of a whitiſh colour, and like to Milk when it was let forth, and afterwards, when he grew better by Chalybiat Medicines, his blood was moderately red: but concerning the ſetling of the blood and its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, there is enough. But as blood being emitted from the Veſſels by its coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and departure of the parts one from another, imitates the various ſubſtances of congealed Milk, ſo ſomtimes being ſhut within the Veins and Arteries, like ſame fuſed by a Coagulum, enters altogether into the like mutation from Morbific cauſes; by reaſon of which change, being hindred in its Circulation, or ſomwhere congealed and fixed according to its portions, it produces many diſtempers: for it ſeems, that from hence the Pleuriſie, the Squinancy, the Inflammation of the Lungs, the Dyſentery, take their Original, and to this Cauſe the Peſtilent diſeaſes, ow chiefly their deadlineſs, as ſhall be ſaid hereafter in its place.</p>
                     <p>It is ſufficient that we have hitherto drawn a parallel of the blood, from which compariſon with Wine and Milk, may be gathered what ſort of Particles and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, it comprehends in it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> Spirituous, and very agil or nimble, (ſuch as generous or rich Wine has) for the heat and motion; and beſides ſoft and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (ſuch as are in Milk) for the nouriſhment of the Body. Yea alſo, this Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of it with Wine and Milk, is yet further confirmed by the uſe of them in our diet, out of which the blood is generated; foraſmuch as Milk is the beſt and moſt ſimple Aliment, and with it Infants, and Children, who have need of a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful proviſion of blood are nouriſhed chiefly: But Wine copiouſly begets vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits before all other things, and being weak and fallen, excellently reſtores them, wherefore it is wont to be eſteemed inſtead of Nectar for old men, or thoſe of ripe years.</p>
                     <p>The Nature and Analyſis of the blood flowing within the Veſſels, being opened af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, the Nutritious Juice deſerves yet our conſideration, being ſupplyed from the blood, and ſeparated out of the maſs of blood, for the nouriſhment of the ſolid parts, and cleaving to them (whereby it may be the better aſſimilated) like Dew. For the Nerves, Tendons, and the reſt of the ſolid parts of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, are waſhed with a certain alible juice. The Vital Spirits, having obtained the Nervous Bodies for a Vehicle of this, blow them forth at length, and expeditiouſly execute the actions of Senſe: alſo that humor coming upon the ſolid parts, and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated with them, inlarges their bulk and growth. This is not a place to inquire after the Origine, Birth, and manner of the diſpenſation of this: It ſhall ſuffice on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we have noted, that it is ſupplyed from the maſs of blood, and (as it is rendered highly probable by the moſt Learned Doctor <hi>Gliſſon,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Wharton</hi>) after it hath paſt through the Nervous part by a certain Circulation, what remains, being now made as it were poor, and lifeleſs, is ſent back by the Lymphatic Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, to the blood. Whilſt this Juice, being little cocted, or purged from dregs, is ſent from the depraved blood, to the Nervous parts, tis wont variouſly to irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate

                     <p>SO much for the Anatomy of the Blood, as to its primary Elements and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive parts, into which it is ſenſibly wont to be reſolved; alſo as to its Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which appear clearly, by the comparing it with Wine and Milk: it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for us next to enquire concerning the motion of the Blood, both Natural, (<hi>viz.</hi> by the help of what Ferment, and by what ſwelling up of parts, it is Circulated in a perpetual motion through the Veſſels) and preternatural, <hi>viz.</hi> for what Cauſes, and what fury of parts, when it boils up above meaſure in the Veſſels, and conceives Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh Efferveſcences. Theſe being rightly unfolded and premiſed, we will enter upon the Doctrine of Feavers.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Natural Motion of the Blood, we ſhall not here enquire of its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, <hi>viz,</hi> by what Structure of the Heart and Veſſels, it is wheeled about after a conſtant manner, as it were in a water Engine; but of its Fermentation, <hi>viz.</hi> by what mixtion of parts, and mutual action of them together among themſelves (like Wine fermenting in the Ton) it continually boils up. And this kind of motion, (as it were truly an inteſtine war of the blood) depends both on the Heterogeneity of the parts of the blood it ſelf, and on the various Ferments, which are breathed into the maſs of the blood from the Bowels.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt: thoſe things which have altogether like Particles do not ferment, wherefore, neither diſtilled waters, Chymical Oils, Spirits of Wine, or other ſimple Liquors are moved, as hath been already obſerved: but I have ſaid, that Blood, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nature things quickly irritable, doth conſiſt of a proportionate mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Elements; in which Spirits, for that they are very nimble, continually ſtrive to expand themſelves and to fly away: but being intangled by the more thick Particles of the reſt, they are detained in their flight. And being detained after this manner, they toſs about, break to pieces, and very much ſubtiliſe the more thick lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bodies, by which they are hindered; they volatiliſe the Salt, otherwiſe fixed; by a moſt minute kneading, and by the adheſion of it, they perfectly diſſolve the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, compacted in it ſelf, and not miſcible with the reſt, and boil it in the <hi>Serum.</hi> They break the Earth, even to its ſmalleſt parts, and mingle it with the reſt. But in the mean time, by the ſtriking and molding the Salt and the Sulphur, <hi>Effluvia's</hi> of heat plentifully proceed, which being mixed with the reſt, and on every ſide diffuſed, increaſe the motion of the Fermentation. And after this manner all being moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely broken and diluted with watery Particles, they conſtitute the Liquor of the Blood: which, whilſt in the Veſſels, as Wine ſhut up in a Pipe, continually ferments, and, according to all its Particles is in perpetual motion.</p>
                     <p>But the Fermentation of Wine, and of Blood, differs in this: that in Wine there is no waſting of the old parts, and a coming again of new; but the Liquor being ſhut up in the Veſſel, remains ſtill the ſame: but 'tis otherwiſe in Blood, in which ſome parts are continually deſtroyed, and in their place others are always generated anew. In Wine, the times of crudity, maturation, and defection, are diſtinct, and are ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively performed in the whole; In Blood, that threefold ſtate is celebrated at the ſame time and by parts: Fermentation being once begun in Wine, is continued even to the end; but in Blood, becauſe it is waſhed ſtill with crude Juices, it ought ſtill to be renewed; by which means, the Nutritious Particles, not of kin, are aſſimilated to the reſt of the Latex; wherefore, for this work, beſides the Fermentation once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the blood, there is need of ſome Ferments, which may continue the ſame, otherwiſe about to leave off.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:152521:40"/>That Ferments are required for the making of Blood, this is an Argument; that when they are wanting by Nature, they are with good ſucceſs ſupplyed by the work of Art: for fixed Salts, <hi>Alcaly</hi> Salt, Extracts, Digeſtives, Openers, and eſpecially Chalybeate Remedies, help for this reaſon, that, as it were by a certain Ferment, they reſtore anew, the weak, or almoſt extinct Ebullition or Boiling of the Blood.</p>
                     <p>As to what reſpects the Natural Ferments, very many may certainly be formed, and in divers parts, or hid in the Bowels: for any humor, in which the Particles of Salt, Sulphur or Spirit, being much exalted, are contained, puts on the Nature of a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: after this manner, the flowring or dregs of Beer or new Wine, being kneaded with Meal, and the maſs kept to a ſowrneſs, come under this rank, by which new Beer, and the like Liquors, as alſo the maſs of Bread, are moſt excellently Fermented. In like manner in the Ventricle, a ſowriſh humour participating of exalted Salt, there helps concoction: and in the Spleen, the feculencies of the Blood from Salt and Earth being exalted, go into a Ferment.</p>
                     <p>How much vigor comes to the Blood from the Womb and Genital parts appears from hence, becauſe by the privation, or evil diſpoſition of them, follow, in Maids the Green ſickneſs, in men, barrenneſs or loſs of virility, want of Beard, and a ſhrill voice. But the chief Ferment, that ſerves for ſanguification, is eſtabliſhed in the Heart; for this is the chief fire-place, in which the cruder Particles of the Chyme, are as it were inkindled, and acquire a volatileneſs: which thing may be confirmed by many reaſons, but eſpecially by its effects, which we ſuffer in the precordia, as often as the Blood ferments more or leſs than it ought to do: for when it is too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled in the Heart, it is agitated impetuouſly, as it were by fires put under it; the ſigns of whoſe immoderate Ebullition are, a deep pulſe and vehement, then almoſt an intolerable heat in the Precordia, with a vehement thirſt; on the other ſide, when the Fermentation of the blood is leſſened in the Heart, we are affected with an anhelous, and difficult reſpiration upon any motion; as may be perceived in the Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Cachexia, and Yellow Jaundice: the reaſon of which is, not becauſe the Lungs are ſtuffed, or filled full of a tough or clammy matter; but becauſe the blood doth not rightly ferment, in that Repoſitory of Fermentation; wherefore, being fallen into its Boſom, it is not preſently Rarified; nor doth it ſoon leap forth into the Lungs, but being apt to ſtagnate, and remain there, cauſes an oppreſſion of the Heart it ſelf; for the helping of which, frequent breathing is made, that the blood being let forth into the Lungs, ſuccour might be brought to it: but if by motion or exerciſe, the blood be more provoked into its Ventricle, than can be derived by reſpiration, or the pulſe, into the Pneumonic Veſſels, there is danger of choaking. The like happens in thoſe that are dying: when the pulſe is very ſmall, and the blood being heaped up in the Heart for want of Fermentation, begins to ſtagnate and to clodder, we then breath deeply, with a noiſe and elevation of the breaſt; to wit, the blood with the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate endeavour of Nature, and the whole force of the Lungs, as long as it is able to be done, is emptied forth into the Lungs, leſt reſiding in the Heart, it ſhould wholly choak it.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, Motion and Heat, in the Blood, depend chiefly on two things, <hi>viz.</hi> partly on its own proper diſpoſition and conſtitution, by which, it being forged very greatly with active Principles of Spirits, Salt, and Sulphur, of its own accord ſwells up, or grows turgid in the Veſſels, even as Wine in the Ton: and partly on the Ferment implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Heart, which very much rarifies the Liquor paſſing through its Boſom, and makes it to leap forth with a frothy heat: that the blood, which is quietly inſtilled to the Heart through the Veins, running gently like a River, from thence leaping forth through the Arteries, (like a Torrent) with noiſe and rage, might be carried forward, to all the parts of the whole Body. By what means this is done, though it is not eaſie to explicate Mechanically, yet the manner, and ſome not improbable reaſons of this thing, are delivered by moſt Learned men, <hi>Ent, Cartes,</hi> and others. They ſuppoſe indeed, as it were a fire to be ſet in the Chimny of the Heart, which preſently inkindles the blood infuſed through the Veins, (even as a flame put to Wine burns it) which being ſo inkindled, by its deflagration (like lightning) paſſes moſt ſwiftly through the Arteries: ſo that heat, a moſt rapid motion, and <hi>Effluvia</hi> ſent by Perſpiration, are wont to proceed from the accenſion of the blood in the Heart only. <hi>Hogelandus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that there is a Ferment hid in the Boſom of the Heart, that compels the Liquor of the blood to boil up, and to grow hot, with heat, and a plentiful emiſſion of Soot, juſt like Spirit of Nitre, when it is poured on the Butter of Antimony: ſo that the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:152521:41"/>
blood flowing in gently through the Veins, being forthwith Rarified into ſpume and vapour by the ferment of the Heart, runs very impetuouſly through the paſſages of the Arteries. Tis almoſt the ſame thing, whether it be ſaid to be done, either by this, or by that way: for the alteration which the blood receives in the Heart, may be equally deduced from a flame, or a Nitrous Sulphureous ferment, there ſuppoſed to be placed. Becauſe, whilſt the blood ſlides into the Ventricles of the Heart, preſently the frame of the Liquor is looſned, and the active Particles, eſpecially the Spirituous and Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the bond of the mixture being broke, do leap forth from the reſt, and ſtrive to expand themſelves on every ſide; but being kept in by the Veſſels, and being forced together with the remaining Liquor, through the open paſſages of the Arteries, they ruſh with violence, and ſwelling up by the way they can find, and by that means, diffuſe <hi>Effluvia</hi> of heat, through the whole body: there is little difference, whether this expanſion of the Particles of the blood, and exertion into the liberty of motion, be ſaid to be done by Accenſion, or by Fermentation, foraſmuch as by either way, the frame of the blood may be ſo unlocked, that from thence the Particles of Spirit, Salt, and eſpecially of Sulphur, being incited into motion, (as it were by an inkindled fire) may impart heat to the whole Body.</p>
                     <p>But this Rarefaction, or Accenſion of the blood in the Heart, very much depends upon the diſpoſition and conſtitution of the blood it ſelf: for if its Liquor be rightly cocted, being made volatile, and (like rich Wine) brought to maturity, it then Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there after its due manner, whereby the ſoluted Particles of the Spirits and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, diffuſe an equal, and moderate heat to all parts. But if the blood, by reaſon of an ill manner of feeding, and want of Concoction, be crude and watry, then it is leſs inkindled in the Heart; and from thence follow a frigid intemperance of the whole, difficult breathing and wheeſing, with a weak pulſe, and languiſhing; as in Cache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical people, thoſe diſtempered with the Green Sickneſs, and ſuch as are about to die, may be perceived: but if the blood becomes too luxuriant, and apt to grow tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid, by reaſon of plenty of Sulphur being carried forth, or of its <hi>Effluvia</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, or of eating hot things; either its Accenſion or Fermentation in the Heart, is very much increaſed, ſo that from thence a Feaveriſh heat, and greater efferveſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies than uſual, are ſtirred up in the whole. This various Fermentation of the blood in the Heart, according to the various temper of the ſame, may be illuſtrated by the example of Wine: freſh Muſt, that is yet crude, though it be boiled, or put on the fire, will not burn; but this being purified and brought to maturity, is eaſily inkindled, but ſends forth a ſmall flame, and quickly out. The ſame at firſt growing hot, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe warmed, if inkindled, is greatly inflamed, and for the moſt part is conſumed by its burning.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the Blood, after this manner being rarified, or inkindled in the Heart, and from thence growing hot, through the paſſages of the Veſſels, is reſolved into minute parts, ſome little bodies depart from its looſned frame, which refuſe at laſt to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and fitted with the reſt of the Liquor: but theſe are of a twofold Nature; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thin, which like ſmoke from the burning fire, or <hi>Effluvia</hi> from a Fermenting Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, do evaporate from the Liquor of the Blood, by a conſtant Diaphoreſis, through the breathing holes of the Body; or more thick, which like aſhes left after burning or the ſettling dregs after Fermentation, ought to be ſoon ſtrained from the maſs of Blood, and to be carried forth of doors: for otherwiſe, by their confuſion, they produce notable perturbations in the Blood. Whereby the Blood growing more hot, is diſſolved in the Heart, therefore theſe recrements, both Fuliginous and Earthy, are more plentifully heaped together; and when by reaſon of too great congeſtion, they cannot be preſently ſubdued and ſecluded from the maſs of Blood, they bring forth a ſwelling up of the Blood and Feaveriſh Heats.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Motion, Heat, and Natural Fermentation of the Blood, in the equal tenor of which, the means of our Health conſiſts, what hath hitherto been ſpoken, ſhall ſuffice. We will treat a little more largely of the preternatural, or too great efferveſcency, on which the types, and Paroxyſms of Feavers depend: I call that too much, or Preternatural Fermentation, when the Blood, (like a Pot boiling over the fire) grows hot above meaſure, and being rarified with a ſwelling ſpume, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtends the Veſſels, excites a more quick pulſe, and like a Sulphureous Liquor having taken fire, diffuſes a burning heat on every ſide.</p>
                     <p>This kind of motion or Fermentation of the Blood, will be beſt of all illuſtrated by an example of Wines growing hot. For Wines, beſides the gentle and equal Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:152521:41"/>
by which they are at firſt purified, at ſome times do ſo remarkably grow hot, and boil up, that they fly out of the mouth of the Veſſel, and if they are cloſely ſtopped up, cauſe it to burſt in pieces. After this manner, as if ſtruck with fury, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are immediately drawn away from the Tartar; or their Lees into another Veſſel, they will not ceaſe from growing hot, until the Spirit being very much looſned, and the Sulphur or Salt too much exalted, they are either made unſavory, or degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into a ſowrneſs.</p>
                     <p>Such an Efferveſcency in wont to be ſtirred up for two cauſes chiefly: Firſt, When any extraneous thing, and not miſcible, is poured into the Ton, (ſo ſome drops of Tallow, or Fat, being dropped into the Cask; will produce this motion) or ſecondly, when Wines being enriched with too rich a Lee or Tartar (by reaſon of the Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts being above meaſure exalted) conceive heats of their own accord, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly boil up. For in whatſoever ſubſtance Sulphur abounds, and its Particles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing looſned from the mixture, conſociate together, and are bound cloſe in one, there ſuch immoderate heats are procured.</p>
                     <p>After a like (tho not wholly the ſame) manner, whereby Wines grow hot, the boiling up of the Blood is induced, to wit, either what is forein, and not akin to the Blood, is mixed with it, that when it is not aſſimilated, is wont to cauſe a Perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and growing hot, until that Heterogeneous thing, is either ſubdued or caſt forth of doors; and the Particles of the Blood being confuſed and troubled, are at laſt ſhaken forth, and that they get again their former place and poſition in the mixture. Or, Secondly, the Blood grows hot above meaſure, becauſe ſome Principle, or its conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive Element, (<hi>viz.</hi> Spirit or Sulphur) is carried forth beyond its Natural temper, and becomes enraged; whereby indeed the Particles of this or that, being not agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the reſt, are looſned from the mixture; being looſned, they become more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than they ought, ſhake much the Liquor of the Blood, and bring forth a heat, which is not allayed, till the Blood being as it were inflamed, burns forth with the long fire of a Feaver. By either way, whether the Blood grows hot in the Veſſels, by reaſon of the pouring in of a thing not miſcible, or by reaſon of the rage of the Spirit, or Sulphur being carried forth, becauſe from thence its frame is more looſned, therefore it is more inkindled in the Heart; and the active Particles firſt looſned from the Ferment there implanted, do grow exceeding hot, leap forth from the mixture, and diſperſe on every ſide by their motion, a ſtrong heat, and as it were fiery: but yet with this difference, that the Effervency, which depends upon the mingling of ſome extraneous thing with the Blood, is for the moſt part ſhort, or renewed, which, when what was Heterogeneous is ſeparated or ſubdued, is quieted of its own accord, and the ſhaken parts of the Blood, and put out of order, eaſily return to their Natural ſite and diſpoſition. But the Ebullition which ariſes from the inordination of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or Sulphur being enraged, is continual; to wit, here the whole maſs of the Blood is ſo looſned, and diſſolved from the ſtrict bond of the mixture, that as an Oily Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor having taken fire, it ceaſes not to grow hot, or to be inflamed, till the Particles of Spirit, or Sulphur, or the Combuſtible matter, be for the moſt part burnt out.</p>
                     <p>There remains yet a third manner of Preternatural Fervency, whereby the Blood is ſubject to alteration, which happens not to Wine, but moſt often to Milk; <hi>viz.</hi> when at any time, from a Morbific cauſe, a coagulation of its Liquor is induced, ſo that its ſubſtance is poured forth, and goes into parts, and there is a ſeparation made of the thick and earthy from the thin; by which means the Blood is not fitly circulated in the Veſſels, but that its congealed portions, being apt to be fixed in the extream parts, or to ſtand ſtill in the Heart, do interrupt the equal motion, or grievouſly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it: For the ſake of the reſtoring of which Effervency, greater are wont to be ſtirred up in the Blood, to wit, ſuch as happen ordinarily in a Pluriſie, the Plague, Small-pox, or the Venereal Diſeaſe.</p>

                     <p>BY the Premiſes which we have ſpoken of already, concerning the Anatomy, Motion, and Heats of the Blood, there now lies open an eaſie paſſage to the handling of Feavers. The Notions which are commonly ſet forth, concerning a Feaver, out of the force and Etymology of the word, I here purpoſely omit: It may be deſcribed after this manner, that it is, An inordinate motion of the Blood, and a too great Heat of it, with burning and thirſt, and other Symptoms beſides, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Natural oeconomy or Government, is variouſly diſturbed. As we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked already, concerning the growing hot of the Blood, ſo now we do of a Feaver, that indeed, its acceſſion is either ſhort, and by fits, which is therefore termed Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting; or elſe great, and long protracted, which is called a continual Feaver. We will firſt ſpeak of the Intermitting Feaver.</p>
                     <p>Tho an Intermitting Feaver, in our Popular Idiom, is known by a proper Name, and is diſtinguiſhed contrary to a Feaver commonly taken, yet becauſe it hath too great Effervency of the Blood joyned to it, it is to be called a Feaver. It is peculiar to this, from a continual Feaver, that it hath certain remiſſions, or times of intermiſſion, that every fit begins with cold or ſhaking, for the moſt part, and ends in Sweat; that the acceſſions or coming of the fits, return at ſet Periods, and certain intervals of times, that a Clock is not more exact. Wherefore, we will firſt diſcourſe concerning this Feaver in general, what ſort of heat of the Blood it is which continues its fit, and from whence it is raiſed up. Secondly, Wherefore the fit appears equally with cold and ſhaking, as with ſweat following. Thirdly, What may be the cauſe of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as alſo of its certain ſet Periods. Fourthly and Laſtly, Are added ſome irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities of Intermitting Feavers, as when now cold, now heat or ſweat is wanting; or when the Periods are wandring and uncertain, when the Remiſſion or ſpace of Intermiſſion, is not equal, but now comes ſooner, now later, and ſomtimes redoubled: and I will endeavor to ſhow the reaſons of theſe: and of other Phenomena or appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, which variouſly happen in this Diſtemper. Theſe being laid open, we will go on to unfold in the next Chapter, the diviſion of an Intermitting Feaver, and the kinds of it.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt: The Effervency of the Blood in an Intermitting Feaver, (or Ague) for the time of the fit, is as violent and ſtrong as in a continual Feaver: wherefore, it is concluded, that the parts of the Blood, among themſelves, or ſome Heterogeneous thing being mixed with it, do ſtrive together, and Ferment above meaſure. But there is required, that they may Ferment, or too greatly boil up among themſelves, that ſome Principle, as chiefly Spirit or Sulphur, being too much exalted and enraged, do appear above the reſt; which, when it cannot be yoaked with them, brings in a continual ſtrife and heat: but from this cauſe, a continual Feaver draws its riſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch an Ebullition of the Blood, being once begun, is not ſuddenly allayed, and when it is appeaſed, it does not afterwards preſently return. Wherefore for an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Feaver, 'tis to be ſuppoſed, that ſome Heterogeneous thing is mingled with the Blood, whoſe Particles, when they are not aſſimilated, make ſo long an Ebulliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſame, till either being kneaded, they are rendered miſcible, or being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliſed, are ſhut forth of doors. Wherefore, ſuch a matter being brought under, or ſhut forth of doors, the fit ceaſes, and when this matter ſprings again, it ſtirs up a new Ebullition, and ſo a new fit is brought on.</p>
                     <p>Concerning this Matter, which being mixed with the Blood, induces the periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Heats, and the other Symptoms of an Intermitting Feaver, 'tis very ambiguouſly, and diverſly diſputed among Phyſicians, where it is generated, in what ſeat or place it lodges, and by what means it ſo exactly obſerves, the times of its Motion, and Ebullition. But it would be a work of too much labour and tediouſneſs, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count here all the Arguments, of the Ancients, and Moderns, to reduce them into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and to weigh their reaſons; Wherefore, doubting, I propoſe what has come into
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:152521:42"/>
my mind, when I thought deeply of the matter, and ſubmit to the judgment of others.</p>
                     <p>Of neceſſity there is ſomthing, which brings in the Heat of the Blood exactly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodical, that is generated in our Body at the ſeveral periods, or acceſſions of the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, always in a ſet meaſure, and equal proportion, and is communicated to the maſs of Blood; with which when the Blood is filled to a plenitude, it forthwith grows tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid, and conceives an heat: But this is ſuppoſed to be either an Excrementitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, ſliding down into ſome Mines, which by degrees, and at a ſet time, being brought to an increaſe, and moved, Ferments with the Blood: or it is the nutritious Juice, ſupplyed from the matter of Food, and delated in weight and meaſure, which, when it is not aſſimilated, by reaſon of a defect in ſanguification, being heaped up to a fulneſs, for its own expulſion, induces a turgency in the Blood. The reaſon of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting Feavers, is commonly explicated by the former way, and the cauſes of the Intermiſſion, and ſet times of approach, are fetcht from the nature of the Humor, and the ſeat, or place where it is cheriſhed. The Neſt, or Mine of this Diſeaſe, almoſt by an unanimous conſent, is fixed on the firſt ſhop of the Body, and from hence the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Intermiſſion is fetched, and the continual difference of an Intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: but they affirm the matter to be Choler, Phlegm, and Melancholy; and as theſe humors are ſaid to putrifie flower, or ſooner, ſo the Feaveriſh courſes, are ſaid to be abſolved, in the ſpace of one or more days. But this Opinion, after the Circulation of the Blood hath been made plainly known to all, is deſervedly rejected. For when the Blood never ſtagnates in the Veſſels, but waſhes every place with a perpetual moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and continually carries away their filth, it is impoſſible that the Mine of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe ſhould ſubſiſt in the Meſaraick Veins, where it is commonly aſſerted to be: as to what belongs to the cavities or dens, for the heaping up of the humors in the Viſcera, it neither appears, by what means ſuch ſhould be formed without a Tumor or Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hume; nor by what inſtinct, ſuch humors, ſhut up in their Neſt, do increaſe, are conſumed, and laſtly ſpring forth again, at ſo exact intervals of times. Beſides, what is affirmed concerning Bile, Phlegm, and Melancholy, and of their periodical moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we hold wholly ſuſpected; becauſe theſe ſort of humors, are not afforded ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, ſuch as are deſcribed in the Schools: but the Blood, having gotten a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſition, now being hotter, now colder, its nature imitates the qualities of ſuch humors; or in its Circulating, it lays aſide its Recrements, which being depoſited in little Cheſts or Veſſels, are falſely believed to be Morbific, and Preternatural humors. Wherefore, as the nutritious Juice, is the only humor wherewith the maſs of Blood is dayly refreſhed, and its ſupplements are made ſtill in meaſure, and proportion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, the periodical heats of the Blood, are to be drawn from the acceſſion and commixtion of this.</p>
                     <p>I have already remarked concerning the Particles of the Blood, a triple ſtate of crudity, maturation, and defection: to wit, the nouriſhing Juice, ſupplyed from the dayly Food, comes crude, is mixed with the Blood, and being for ſome time Circulated, is aſſimilated to it, and is ripened into a perfect humor: afterwards growing ſtale, it goes into parts and is laid aſide. Whilſt after this equal manner, the Blood is continually reſtored, and its loſſes repaired, it very quietly Ferments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trouble, or immoderate heat, and is Circulated within the Veſſels; but if the ſupplement of the nouriſhing Juice, is not (as before) ripened, nor goes into Blood, by a perfect digeſtion, its Particles being confuſed with the Blood, remain as it were ſome Heterogeneous thing, and not exactly akin, in the maſs of Blood; with which, when it is filled to a plenitude, the Blood forthwith grows troubled, and conceives a Feaveriſh heat, whereby the freſh ſupply of this depraved Juice, is either overcome or caſt forth of doors. I ſay therefore, from the firſt inſtant, in which the nouriſhing Juice is not aſſimilated with the Blood, its Particles, tho mixed with it, are as yet Circulated with it, without any great tumult or perturbation, and ſo afterwards till the maſs of the Blood is filled with them to a turgency: but then it quickly boils up, and conceives a heat: almoſt after the ſame manner, as new Beer put into Bottles, which, if they are cloſely ſtopped, that nothing may evaporate, is at firſt contained in thoſe Veſſels, without heat or force; afterwards when the <hi>Effluvia</hi> being ſtill reſtrained, the maſs of the Liquor ſwells up, notably Ferments, and by reaſon of the force of Fermentation, oftentimes makes the Bottles fly in pieces: alſo this happens at a ſet time, and in the ſpace of ſo mnay hours, as in an Intermitting Feaver, the Liquor ariſes to its height of turgeſcency.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:152521:43"/>There yet remains a difficulty, for what cauſe the nutritious Juice, being confuſed with the Blood, is not aſſimilated, but degenerates into an Heterogeneous, and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative matter: I ſuppoſe this to be done, for the moſt part, not by the default of the Aliments, nor yet of the Bowels, but by the vice of the Blood it ſelf. For the Blood, even as Wine, ſomtimes paſſes from its native and genuine diſpoſition, into an acid, ſowr, or auſtere diſpoſition; and becauſe the Blood makes Blood, it comes to paſs, that when it is departed from its due temper, it eaſily perverts the proviſion of the nutritious Juice, by which it ſhould be repaired. What that diſpoſition of the Blood is, and by what means contracted, ſhall be told hereafter, when we ſpeak of the kinds of Intermitting Feavers, and of their evident, and Procatarctick cauſes. The Heat, or Efferveſcency therefore of the Blood, which conſtitutes the fit of an Intermitting Feaver, depends only upon the aſſimilation of the nouriſhing Juice being hindered; the Particles of this being commixed with the Blood, are not (as before) ripened, nor are made into perfect Blood; but by the mixture of theſe, the maſs of Blood (as it were new drink) is imbued with little Bodies greatly Fermentative; when the which are more thickly heaped together, and the Blood is filled with them to a ſwelling up, it preſently grows hot, and a mighty agitation, and ſtrife of the Particles is made, by which, they break, and ſubtiliſe one another, till at length the vital Spirit getting the dominion, and the reſt being brought under, what is extraneous is thruſt forth of doors, from the company of which, the Blood being freed, the remiſſion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion of the aguiſh fit follows; but afterwards from a new ſupply of this Juice, a new fit is brought on.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As to the ſhaking, or cold preceding the heat, in this Diſtemper, I ſay, when the Particles of the nouriſhing Juice, do proceed from a ſtate of crudity, towards maturity, but do not attain it, they contract a notable ſowriſhneſs, with which they greatly prick, and haule the nervous parts, and cauſe the ſenſe of cold: even as new Beer, which being ſtopped cloſe in Bottles, paſſes from a ſweet into an acid and nitrous taſt, that for the cuttingneſs and cold, can ſcarce be ſwallowed. When therefore, the Particles of this ſort of crude Juice, being indued with a Nitrous ſowrneſs, do fill the maſs of the Blood to a fulneſs, or to a ſwelling up, and when they being more thickly heaped together, begin to enter into a Flux, they firſt of all ſtrike down the Vital Spirits, with their ſharpneſs, and ſomwhat overthrow their heat; wherefore the Blood becomes colder, and is more ſlowly circulated: yea, and by reaſon of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of heat, the ſenſe of cold is perceived in the whole Body, and a pulſe very rare exiſts. Moreover, when the nervous and ſolid parts, are watered with this ſort of acetous Juice, for their laſt nouriſhment, by the Flux of this, which happens to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the turgeſcency of the Blood, theſe ſenſible parts are pulled, and irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Tremblings and Convulſions. And this without doubt is the true and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine cauſe of the cold and ſhaking, which are excited in a fit of the intermitting Feauer; to wit, the Flux, and ſwelling up of the nouriſhing Juice, degenerated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Nitrous matter, with which the Spirits and Heat being ſuffuſed, are blunted, and the Nervous Bodies being provoked, are moved into tremblings. But afterwards, when theſe Nitrous Particles being thruſt forth, from ſome part, into the Superficies of the Body, the Blood is ſomwhat freed from their weight and oppreſſion, the Vital Spirits recollect themſelves, and begin to ſhine forth; but from thence a moſt intenſe heat ſucceeds, becauſe, both the maſs of Blood, by reaſon of the growing hot with the Feaveriſh matter, being looſened, and alſo its mixture being laxed, the Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Particles are more plentifully inkindled in the Heart; and becauſe (the pores of the skin, being poſſeſſed by the ſame matter, thruſt forth towards the circumference of the Body) the vaporous <hi>Effluvia</hi> are reſtrained within, which do more ſhake, and make hot the Blood; that heat perſiſts ſtill in the Blood, until that Fermentative matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly burnt out, and together with the aduſt recrements, remaining after the burning, being fully brought under, and ſubtiliſed, and involved with the <hi>Serum,</hi> inſenſibly evaporates by ſweat, or tranſpiration.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Theſe things being premiſed, it will not be hard to ſhew the reaſons and cauſes of the intermiſſion, as alſo of the ſet periods, <hi>viz.</hi> the intermiſſion follows, becauſe all the Morbific matter is diſperſed in one fit, and ſo till new be ſubſtituted, there is a neceſſity that a remiſſion follow. But new matter begins to be begot, of which the laſt fit failed, to wit, the maſs of Blood being but now emptied, receives the nouriſhing Juice, and perverts it (as before) by reaſon of its defect of due making of Blood, and of Concoction, into a Fermentative matter; but its little plenty, ſtirs up little or no
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:152521:43"/>
trouble, or Fermentation; but when the Blood is filled to a ſwelling up, it preſently ferments, and is in Flux, even as when new Beer, or new Wine, ſhut up a long while in a Veſſel, at length, at a certain time, boils up, and leapes forth at the mouth of the Veſſel.</p>
                     <p>But that the Fits, or Acceſſions, do for the moſt part come again, at ſet intervals of times, and that ſo certainly, that a Clock is not more exact; the reaſon is, becauſe the nouriſhable Juice, is for the moſt part ſupplyed from the Viſcera, to the Blood flowing in the Veſſels, in an equal meaſure and manner; for tho we do not dayly take exactly, ſo much meat and drink in weight and dimenſion, yet, becauſe we for the moſt part eat at ſet hours, for the ſatisfying the Appetite, from the things eaten, and the maſs of the Chyme heaped up in the Bowels, an equal portion of the nutritious Juice is conveyed to the Blood through the Milky Veſſels: wherefore, if at ſuch hours, ſo much of the nutritious humor is poured into the Blood, which increaſing to a fulneſs, and ſwelling up, it brings on the fit that day: certainly, this being finiſhed; in the ſpace of the ſame time, ſufficient matter is laid up, for the following fit: But if errors in feeding be committed, and that the ſick indulging their Appetite, eat more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully or inordinately, the approach of the fit anticipates the wonted hour, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Bloods being filled ſooner with the Feaveriſh matter; if that the ſick are abſtemious, and more ſparingly take their Food, the intermiſſion is drawn out longer.</p>
                     <p>If it be yet asked, wherefore the periods of intermitting Feavers, be not of one kind, and of the ſame diſtance, but that ſome repeat or come again dayly, others on the third or fourth day? The cauſe is the diverſe conſtitution of the Blood, to wit, whereby it is perverted from its due temper, now into a ſouriſh, now into an acid or ſharp, or into an auſtere or harſh diſpoſition. By reaſon of the diverſe evil conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, the alible Juice, being freſh carried, departs more or leſs from maturati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is perverted into matter, apt ſooner or later to ferment. When the Blood has acquired a ſour, hot, and bilous diſpoſition, I ſuppoſe that ſome part of the nouriſhing Juice is ripened into perfect humor, and is aſſimilated with the Blood, and ſo goes into Food, to be carried to the ſolid parts, and is affixed to them; but the other part of it, from the Blood being too much cocted, and depraved, is changed into a Feaveriſh matter, and ſuppoſing, that half of the nutritious Juice is after this manner perverted; in double the time, in which it is ſaid to have a full Concoction in our Body, (that is, after eight and forty hours) this kind of Fermentative mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, riſes to a plenitude, and turgeſcency, and then induces the fit of a Tertian Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. If that, by reaſon of the auſtere, and pontic nature of the degenerated Blood, (in which a fixed Salt, with an Earthy <hi>Faeces</hi> is exalted too much) and therefore apt to ferment more ſlowly, only a third part of the nutritious Juice is corrupted, then in three times the ſpace of the aforeſaid time, the fit is induced; that is, after ſeventy two hours, in which, the period of a Quartan, is wont to be concluded. But, if by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a greater infection of the Blood, almoſt the whole ſupplement of the nutritious Juice is perverted into a Feaveriſh matter; then in the ſpace of that time, in which the plenary coction ought to be abſolved in the Veſſels and habit of the Body, (that is after twenty four hours) this matter ariſes up to the motion of turgeſcency, and brings on the Quotidian fit. And hence it comes to paſs, that in a Quartan Feaver, ſtrength and courage do not preſently fail, whilſt in a Tertian, the ſick are wont to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more weak; but in a Quotidian Feaver, they are ſooner brought into languiſhing, and greateſt weakneſs: to wit, in each, as more or leſs of the nutritious Juice goes into the Food of the Diſeaſe, ſo much alſo is drawn away, from the ſtrength and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Body. But more fully of theſe, when we treat of the ſeveral kinds of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting Feavers, and the Cauſes of them.</p>
                     <p>Againſt the equal Circuits of theſe Feavers, it is argued: that for the moſt part, the fits do anticipate the ſet time of the day, by the ſpace of ſome hours, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo come after it. But in truth, this objection is taken away, if the times of intermiſſion be computed, not by days, but by hours; for ſo the intervals which but now ſeemed to be now ſooner, now longer protracted, will appear for the moſt part equal, by this Rule; foraſmuch as in reſpect of the day, it is ſaid a Tertian Feaver, ſomtimes prevents the wonted time of its acceſſion, two, three, or more hours, or comes after it; in the mean time, every circuit exactly repeats or comes again, every time, after ſo many hours. Wherefore the chief differences of Intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, conſiſt in this only, that the time of the acceſſion in one Feaver, comes more
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:152521:44"/>
ſwiftly, and in another more ſlowly, <hi>viz.</hi> now at twenty four hours diſtance, now at thirty four, now at ſeventy or the like.</p>
                     <p>From what hath been ſaid, (unleſs I am deceived) it clearly appears, what the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcency of the Blood is, which conſtitutes the fit of an Intermitting Feaver, from whence the fore-runners of cold and ſhaking, and laſtly, what may be the reaſon of the intermiſſion, and of the ſet periods. But that theſe, and many other appearances of this diſtemper, depend upon the evil diſpoſition of the Blood, and becauſe of the depravation of the nutritious Juice, and not from humor, lurking in ſome mine, will yet more manifeſtly appear, from the collation of the ſigns and ſymptoms, which are to be met with, worthy of note, in this diſtemper: then ſecondly, from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catartic, or more remote cauſes being truly weighed, which are wont to induce this diſtemper: and thirdly, and laſtly, from the ways of the Criſis, and Cures, by which this Diſeaſe, either ceaſes of its own accord, or is driven away, by the help of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Among the Signs, the Pulſe and Urine, deſerve the chief conſideration: The Pulſe, the cold fit coming on, is very rare, and low, which clearly argues, the Heat, and Vital Spirits in the Blood, to be as it were overwhelmed, by ſome crude matter, not eaſily combuſtible; juſt as a fire inkindled on the Hearth, and then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with green wood, glows very ſlowly, and flames forth little, which afterwards, the crude humor being blown away, breaks forth into an open and very ſtrong flame: ſo alſo, the Blood, the crude matter, which is in Flux, being ſomthing overcome, or diſperſed, is very much inkindled; and what remains in the Blood is burnt up, when fermenting with the Particles of it, and induces a moſt violent heat, with thirſt; wherefore the Blood growing impetuouſly hot, is urged with a vehement, and moſt ſwift Pulſe: otherwiſe, it being too much heaped together in the Heart might cauſe the danger of choaking.</p>
                     <p>As to the Urine; that is imbued (eſpecially in a Tertian Feaver) with a deep colour, and as it were inflamed, alſo when the Contents are wanting; which ſeems to denote a ſcorching of the Blood, and too aduſt temper: moreover, in this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, different from others, the Urine, for the moſt part is ill, when the Patient is pretty well, and on the contrary; foraſmuch as all the time of the intermiſſion, it is at a great diſtance from its natural ſtate, it becomes filled with a red colour, and thick, being expoſed to the cold, and lays down a plentiful ſediment, like to Bole-Armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack; which is of neceſſity to be ſo done, becauſe in the whole interval of the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Feaveriſh matter is circulated with the Blood, and there riſes to maturity, with a ſecret increaſe. But in the middle of the fit, when the heat, and burning are at the greateſt, the Urine is laudable, and comes more near to the natural, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fermentative matter, being ſent to the Circumference of the Body.</p>
                     <p>The ſymptoms preceding the fit, confirm the ſame thing; for many hours before the fit begins, a perturbation of the humors, and blood, is perceived; an Headach, Vertigo, ſparkling of the Eyes, unquiet Sleep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which plainly ſhew, the Blood firſt infected with the Fermenting matter, and the aſſault of the fit to be only ſo long deferred, until the maſs of the Blood is filled to a ſwelling up, with the ſame kind of matter: The fore-runners of the approach of the fit are, now a paleneſs at the ends of the Fingers, or Toes, or in the Nails, ſomtimes a Convulſion, or numneſs; now a coldneſs, and pain in the Loins and Thighs, and ſomtimes a ſhivering and trembling invade the whole Body, which clearly ſhew, the Blood in the Arteries and Veins, and alſo the thin Liquor in the Nervous parts, firſt to conceive the motion of Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this Efferveſcency, not to be excited from any other fire-place, or mine. If it be objected, that the ſick are moſt often infeſted with Vomiting, about the time of the fit; from whence it may ſeem to be concluded, that the chiefeſt hurtful matter is eſtabliſhed in the Ventricle, and in the firſt paſſages, eſpecially, when this diſtemper is chiefly cured, by the timely taking of a Vomit; I confeſs, very great Vomitings are ſomtimes ſtirred up, in the fit of an intermitting Feaver; but this more often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, becauſe in the Feaveriſh ſhivering, the membranes of the whole Body are pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; wherefore the Ventricle alſo, as it is a very Nervous part, is diſtempered with a Convulſion, and having from thence contracted a Spaſm, caſts forth upwards what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever lurks in its boſom. Beſides, if that the Choler-bearing Veſſels, ſwell up with Bile or Choler, by the ſame Convulſion alſo of the Viſcera, the Bile is preſſed forth into the Duodenum by the Galiſh paſſage, and is emptied into the Ventricle, and there, by its fierceneſs, provokes yet to more cruel Vomiting, wherefore for the moſt part,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:152521:44"/>
the vomiting which is excited for this reaſon, follows the ſhaking only. But that the Choler was not in the Stomach before the fit troubled it, but only preſſed forth from the Choleduct paſſage, by the Spaſm and Convulſive motions of the Viſcera, and poured forth into the Ventricle, appears from hence, becauſe if a Vomit be given in the midſt of the interval, between the two fits, little or nothing of bilous matter will be drawn forth; beſides, this bitter humor is of that fierceneſs, that it cannot be long contained in the Ventricle, but preſently it will procure the pain of the Heart, and Vomiting. Beſides this ſort of Vomiting, excited in the ſhaking fit, ſomtimes a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting is provoked in the midſt of the burning fit, or in the ſweat, the cauſe of which is, the redundancy of the biliſh humor in the Blood; of which if there be greater plenty, than what diluted with <hi>Serum</hi> may be ſent forth by Sweat, a great part of it, whilſt the Blood is circulated about the creviſes of the Liver, is laid aſide in the Chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct Veſſels; which, when being filled to a diſtention, exonerate themſelves, and ſend away the Choler to the Inteſtines and Ventricle, and there a Convulſion being preſently ſtirred up, ſomtimes Vomiting is provoked, and ſomtimes the Belly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes looſe, and the Stools liquid. In this Year 1657. I obſerved very many affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted after this manner, for when after an hot and dry Summer, about the middle of Autumn, an Intermitting Feaver generally raged, the ſick were wont ſuddenly to grow very ill, in the middle of their hot fit, and ſomtimes alſo in their ſweating, and the Sweat being ſtruck in, to be taken with Swooning; but ſhortly after, when a Choleric Vomiting followed, they were eaſed.</p>
                     <p>Not only the ſigns and ſymptoms, but the Procatartic or more remote Cauſes of this Diſeaſe, clearly indicate, that it takes its riſe from the temper of the Blood being changed: becauſe Intermitting Feavers, are moſt frequent in the ſeaſon, and places, in which the Blood receives the greateſt alteration from the Air, <hi>viz.</hi> either in the Spring, when the vernal heat ſhutting out the Winters cold, cauſes the Blood, before benumed, and apt to be more ſlowly moved, to begin to flouriſh, and luxuriate in the Veſſels, and from thence, to get a bilous and hot temper: or in the Autumn, when the Blood being torrified, or roaſted by the Summers heat, and therefore its Spirits very much depreſſed, and Salt and Sulphur exalted, acquires now a ſharp and Choleric, now a binding and auſtere diſpoſition: wherefore, at this ſeaſon, Feavers, now Tertian, now Quartan, are frequent; beſides, in ſome places, there is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Heaven, that on all men whatſoever, there comes either a Tertian or (more frequently) a Quartan Feaver; although in the firſt offices, where the Mine of the Diſeaſe is commonly believed to be lodged, there be no congeſtion of humors, by reaſon of an ill manner of living, or ſickly diſpoſition. Yea, they moſt eaſily fall into this Diſeaſe, who have their inwards firm and ſtrong, and who abound with a lively heat: on the contrary, thoſe who by reaſon of a weak Concoction, heap up Crudities in the firſt paſſages continually, that they are prone to the Dropſie, or Cachexia, remain free, for the moſt part, from this Diſtemper; to wit, the Blood being made more watery, (like Wine degenerated into a taſtleſs ſubſtance) is altogether unapt to be fermented.</p>
                     <p>No leſs, doth the Cure of Intermitting Feavers ſeem to prove this our Aſſertion, whether it be Natural and Critical, or Artificial, and performed by the help of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. As to the firſt, Intermitting Feavers are wont to be terminated, after a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold manner. The firſt is, when from the fits themſelves, the temper of the Blood is altered, and oft times is reduced into its Natural diſpoſition. For when in every coming of the fit, very much of Sulphur, and aduſt Salt is burnt out, and exhaled by Sweat, the Liquor of the Blood, by that means, becomes more temperate, and leſs torrid: wherefore, oftentimes this Diſeaſe is cured, at ſix or ſeven periods, and of its own accord ceaſes: but if it be longer protracted, and that the Blood being ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what changed, from the ſharp and bilous temper, or diſpoſition, is not reſtored to its Natural temper, ſomtimes it degenerates into an Acid, Watery, and alſo Pontic or ſaltiſh temper, from whence a long Tertian Feaver paſſes into a Quotidian, or a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; alſo oftentimes, becauſe the Blood is greatly depraved, by the long continuance of this Feaver, the Jaundies, or the Scurvy, or the Cachexia follow. The other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whereby this Diſeaſe is terminated, is, when the change of the Air, or the Country, brings a notable alteration of the Blood: for ſo Feavers begun at the times of the Equinoxes, are ended about the time of the Solſtices; alſo the ſick, traveling into another Region, often grow well.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:152521:45"/>As to the cure of it, by the Inſtitutions of the Medicines, it uſes to be done two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> Empirically, and Dogmatically; and in this Diſeaſe, Empirical remedies, ſought from Quack-ſalvers, and old Women, are more eſteemed, and oftentimes do more than the preſcriptions of Phyſicians, adminiſtred after the exact method of cureing.</p>
                     <p>Empirical Remedies, which are ſaid to cure Intermitting Feavers or Agues, are of that ſort, which drive away the approaching Fit, without any Evacuation: and are either taken inwardly, or are outwardly applyed, where the Pulſes chiefly beat, <hi>viz.</hi> For the moſt part, they are bound either to the region of the heart, or to the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wriſts, or to the ſoles of the feet; theſe ſometimes are ſo commonly known to help, that ſome have warranted the ſudden cure of this Diſeaſe, by theſe Remedies, under the pain of ſome Forfeiture: Wherefore it is worth our inquiry, how theſe operate, and by what way or means they ſtop the Feaveriſh acceſſions. It is clear, Firſt, that thoſe which are outwardly applyed, do immediatly impart force, and action to the Blood, and Spirits; and when they drive away the Fit, by preventing without the Evacuation of humor, or any matter of neceſſity, the reaſon of this effect conſiſts only in this, that by the uſe of theſe ſort of Medicines, the turgeſcency or ſwelling up of the Blood, with the Feaveriſh matter, and Fermentation are ſtop'd, to wit from the Medicine tyed about the Body, certain little Bodys, or Effluvia are communicated to the Blood, which do very much fix, and bind together the particles of it, or alſo, as it were precipitate them, by fuſing and ſhaking them; and by either way, the ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous growing hot of the Blood, is hindred: as when cold water is put into a boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Pot, or as when Vinegar, or Alum is flung into new and working Beer, preſently Fermentation ceaſes, and the Liquor acquires a new taſt, and conſiſtency, whereby it becomes fit to be drunk, as if it had been kept to ripen a long time. But that theſe Ague-ſtoppers do work after this manner, it is plainly ſeen, becauſe thoſe which are of principal note, do excell in a Styptic, and binding force, or elſe with a precipitating virtue; hence Sea-ſalt, Nitre, Sal-gemmae, the Juice of Plantan, Shepherds-burſe, any binding Herbs pounded with Vinegar, and the like, bound to the wriſts; the root of Yarrow, Tormentile, alſo Campher hung about the neck, are ſaid to take away this Diſeaſe: yea, thoſe alſo which are taken inwardly, are of the ſame rank; The Juice of Plantan, Red-roſe water, Alum, for that they fix, and conſtrain the Blood, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Piper, Sal Armoniac, or of Wormwood, Spirit of Vitrial, alſo a ſudden paſſion of anger, or fear, forasmuch as they precipitate the Blood, by fuſing and ſhaking it, do oftentimes hinder the Agues approach: even as the Concuſſion, and ſhaking much, any Liquour, or the infuſion of aſtringent things into it, hinder its ſpontaneous Efferveſcency and rage. It is uſual with ſome Empiricks, for the cure of Agues, to tye a little knot in a Linnen rag, or a piece of Paper roled up, ſo ſtrickly to the wriſts, preſſing hard upon the beating of the Pulſe, that the circulation of the Blood is ſomewhat hindred, and by this means, the Aguiſh fit coming on, is driven away. Very many by this way, I have none to be moſt certainly cured of a tedious ſickneſs; the reaſon of which ſeems to be, that whilſt the Blood is hindred from its motion in any part, it grows more tumultuous in the other parts; and ſo, by this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation, ſtirred up in the whole Blood, the ſpontaneous Efferveſcency of the Liquor, being about to follow, is hindred. But that the Fit, by this, or ony other means, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once hindred, does not afterwards eaſily return, the reaſon is; Becauſe, if this Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh, and depraved matter, be contained longer in the Blood, it is afterwards cocted, and in ſome meaſure ripened: and therefore the Blood does not (as before) altogether pervert, either this, or the proviſion coming to it anew, but begins to digeſt and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milate it: beſides, when the Fit is once ſtop'd, its cuſtom is broke, by the inſtinct of which alone, Nature oftentimes repeats thoſe her Errors: for, as, when it has once made a fault, it is wont more readily to do ill after the ſame way; ſo when it once omits its fault, it more eaſily accuſtoms it ſelf to do better.</p>
                     <p>The dogmatical cure, is inſtituted for the moſt part, by Vomitory and Purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, alſo with the letting of Blood; with which the ſick are miſerably tormented, and the Diſeaſe ſeldom profligated or driven away; that deſervedly, this Diſtemper is called the ſhame of Phyſicians; but Tertian Feavers are ſometimes carried away by a Vomit given juſt before the coming of the Fit, which indeed happens (as I think) for the reaſon before mentioned. For I have ſaid, That the cauſe of a Tertian Feaver, is an evil diſpoſition of the Blood, whereby it paſſes into a four and bilous Nature; and therefore it doth not rightly aſſimilate the nutritious Juice brought to it, but changes
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:152521:45"/>
it into a Fermentative matter; wherefore, if the Bile or Choler be copiouſly drawn forth of the Blood, that Cholerick and hot intemperance is very much taken away, and that Fermentative power ceaſes of it ſelf, But Emetick Medicines do chiefly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this, for if they operate-ſtrongly, a Convulſion is not only brought to the bottom of the Ventricle, but alſo the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> with an inverſe motion, is drawn together to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Pylorus, and the Choler by a continual thruſting forward, being ſquees'd forth from the Choleduct paſſage, is poured into the Ventricle, which is preſently caſt out by Vomit; which being copiouſly performed, the galiſh bladder is almoſt empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and after that, it becomes a receptacle, that draws forth, and ſeparates the bilous humor, or the particles of aduſt Sulphur and Salt plentifully poured into the Blood; the next Fit ſometimes is by this means prevented, not becauſe the mine of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is extirpated by Vomit, but becauſe an Evacuation and motion is excited, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Feaveriſh motion, and for that reaſon, the ſpontaneous Efferveſcency of the Blood is prevented. Alſo by this means, ſometimes the Diſeaſe is taken away af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fit, becauſe this way, the Blood is fully cleared from the bilous humor. It is worthy obſervation, that in a Quartan Feaver, Vomits profit nothing, and ſeldom in a Tertian, unleſs adminiſtred preſently at the beginning, whilſt the Feaveriſh diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is yet light, and not fully confirmed.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Intermitting Feavers in general, there yet remain ſome Irregulars of them, to be explicated, which vary from the wonted manner: for unleſs theſe unuſual appearances be ſolved, this our Hypotheſis will ſeem to be defective, and to halt in one part. Firſt therefore, they are wont ſomtimes to lack the cold or ſhaking fit. This Intermitting Feaver is frequent in Autumn, whoſe fits are wont to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the ſick, only with heat, and that moſt Violent, and in many they come with great Vomiting, but no Sweat or Cold; then after four or five periods, upon the coming on of the fit, the ſick are wont to be chil, and preſently after to quake, and in the declination to ſweat: The reaſon of this was, becauſe, from the very hot Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the Conſtitution of the Blood was become ſharp, and very much burnt: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Particles of the crude Juice, being commixed with it, were preſently terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or made hot, and ſcorched; that they did not at firſt, (like new Beer) grow hot with an Acrimony, and then afterwards blaze forth; but a turgeſcency being ſtirred up, (like dry wood laid upon a fire) preſently the whole took fire, and broke forth into flames; but afterwards, the Liquor of the Blood being fired by ſeveral fits, became leſs torrid, that the depraved Alible Juice was not preſently torrified, but paſſed into a Nitrous matter, and fermenting with a ſharpneſs, which at firſt ſwelling up, induced the ſenſe of cold to the whole Body. When the cold fit was begun, for the moſt part Sweat concluded it: which indeed hapned, becauſe the Blood being made more watery, is more eaſily reſolved into vapour, with the Feaveriſh matter, even as a watery Liquor is more eaſily drawn forth by diſtillation, than what is Oily, or of a more thick conſiſtency.</p>
                     <p>It often happens, in the declination of this Diſeaſe, when the fits begin to leſſen, that the ſenſe of cold and ſhaking, by little and little are diminiſhed, and at length vaniſh, and the fit only troubles the ſick, with a light burning: The reaſon of which is, becauſe at this time, the Blood being ſomwhat reſtored, towards its natural ſtate, begins to concoct and ripen the crude juice; ſo that a great part of it is aſſimilated: but ſome Excrements, being heaped together in the Blood, bring forth as yet a light burning: but when the Feaveriſh Particles, do not participate of the Nitrous Acrimony, the Fermentation of the Blood is induced without any ſhivering, by which, what was extraneous burns forth, is either ſubdued, or carried forth of doors. Somtimes alſo, in the declination of this Diſeaſe, the fits appear without any burning, only with a light cold: The reaſon of which is, becauſe the Morbific matter, being rather Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, than Sulphureous, when it is in Flux, does ſomwhat blunt the Natural Heat; and by that means is diſſipated, and vaniſhes, without any great deflagration.</p>
                     <p>There is yet a great doubt concerning the intervals of the periods, which ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeem to be double in the ſame Feaver, that the firſt Acceſſion anſwers to the third, and either perhaps comes in the morning; and again the ſecond to the fourth, and both happen in the Evening; and ſo forward: wherefore, the Feaver bearing this figure, is wont to be named a double Tertian, or Quartan, of which it doth not eaſily appear, how they ſhould be done, if the fits depend upon the evil diſpoſition of the Blood, and from thence on a Congeſtion to a Turgeſcency of the depraved Nouriſhing Juice: for which cauſe, they commonly affirm, that this double figure is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:152521:46"/>
ſtirred up, or draws its original from a double Neſt, or Mine; but to me it ſeems moſt likely, that in this caſe, ſomtimes it happens for the Feaver to be ſimple, and of one kind, alſo its types or figures to be alike, and all congruous one to another, but the error to ariſe, becauſe the interſtitia of the periods, are not computed by hours, but days: For when as, the beginnings of the fits are diſtant one from another, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly twenty four hours, but either ſixteen, or thirty hours, in a Quotidian; and in a Tertian, not forty eight, but forty, or fifty ſix, more or leſs, or thereabouts; it comes to paſs, that every other fits, happen before, and the others after Noon. To which alſo may be added, that the different manner of eating, which the ſick uſe, very often produces great inequalities of figures: that ſomtimes the fit is redoubled twice in a day, as I have often obſerved in Cachectical men, or full of ill humors, and living diſorderly: but it doth not ſeldom happen, that Intermitting Feavers, repeat fits, which do neither obſerve the ſame diſtance, nor bear altogether the figure of the ſame mode. I have many times obſerved in a Quartan Feaver, that beſides the ſet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or Acceſſions, returning on the fourth day, about the ſame hour; ſome wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and uncertain fits, did infeſt the ſick; that ſomtimes on the day preceeding, the wonted fit, ſomtimes on that following it, another fit (tho lighter) was excited anew, with ſhivering, Heat, and Sweat, exactly like the figure of an Intermitting Feaver; and nevertheleſs, the primary Acceſſion returned at its accuſtomed time. This for the moſt part, is wont to happen, either from diet evilly inſtituted, chiefly from ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, and drinking of Wine; or elſe from Medicines wrongfully adminiſtred: The reaſon of which (unleſs I am deceived) conſiſts in this. The maſs of Blood, being wont to be filled to a ſwelling up, with the Fermentative matter, at a ſet time, often, by reaſon of ſome errors in eating and drinking, heaps up more matter, than can be eaſily diſſipated in one fit; and when it unequally Cooks the ſame Fermentative mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it often happens, that it firſt ſhakes off its ſuperfluous, or more thin part, as it were by a certain skirmiſh, in a more light fit, but diſpels the more thick, (after the primary Acceſſion) as yet remaining in the Blood, by a Feaveriſh Fermentation ariſing anew. And when the fits, in an Intermitting Feaver, redouble after this manner, either become more remiſs, for that the ſame matter in either, is only divided; and eventilated by two acceſſions. Beſides, when this Fermentative matter, or Nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Juice, depraved in its circulation, is continued, partly in the Arteries and Veins, with the Blood, and partly in the Nervous ſtock, and ſolid parts, it may happen, that both humors do not ferment at once, but a great part of one may be diſperſed in one fit, and then a great part of the other, in another fit.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the kinds of Intermitting Feavers, and firſt of a Tertian.</head>
                     <p>WE ſhall eaſily accommodate to our Hypotheſis, delivered in the former Chapter, concerning the nature and beginning of Intermitting Feavers, all the Phaenomena which belong to it, and the reaſons of them. But as thoſe which are of this ſort, do not obſerve the ſame ſpace of Intermiſſion, or of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and their figures, as to the appearances of their ſigns and ſymptoms, do not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether happen after the ſame manner; therefore according to the diverſities of theſe, and eſpecially from the diſtance of the fits, the various ſpecies and differences of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting Feavers, are aſſigned. The chiefeſt diviſion of them is, into Tertian, Quotidian, and Quartan: We ſhall here remark the chief things worthy of note concerning each of them.</p>
                     <p>It is called a Tertian Feaver, not which is accompliſhed at the diſtance of three days; but incluſively from the day in which one Fit begins, from thence the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns on the third. In the mean time, if the Fits be ſometimes longer, <hi>viz.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted almoſt to twenty four hours, and the Remiſſions anticipated alſo by their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, or comings of the Fits, the ſpace is oftentimes leſs by a night and a day. This Diſeaſe is commonly diſtinguiſhed into exquiſite and ſpurious; The exquiſite or exact Tertian Feaver is, which begins with a vehement ſhaking, to which ſucceeds a ſharp and biting heat, which goes off in ſweat, and its Fit is finiſhed in twelve hours, and that the perfect intermiſſion follows; In the ſpurious or baſtard Tertian, the cold and heat are more remiſs, but the Fit is often extended beyond twelve hours, yea often to eighteen or twenty. Theſe differ as to the various diſpoſition of the Blood, which is in the former more torrid and ſharp; therefore perverts the alible Juice from Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, towards an aduſtion, wherefore a more vehement Efferveſcency is ſtirred up; but as the matter more equally burns forth, it is ſooner finiſhed. In the latter, beſides the aduſtion, the Blood abounds with too much ſerous humidity, wherefore, the nouriſhing Juice degenerates into a Crude matter, and therefore leſs apt to be overcome, and to burn forth; wherefore, its Fit is gentler, and more unequal, but is not finiſhed but in a longer ſpace.</p>
                     <p>The Eſſence therefore of a Tertian Feaver conſiſts in this; That the Blood (like Beer brew'd with too high dry'd Mault) being too ſharp, and torrid, does not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubdue, and ripen the alible Juice, which is taken in from crude things eaten, but very much perverts it into a nitrous-ſulphurous matter; with which, when the maſs of Blood is filled to a ſwelling up, like new Beer ſtop'd up in Bottles, it conceives an heat: From the flux of this nitrous matter, which blunts the heat, and vital ſpirits, and pulls the nervous parts, firſt the cold, with ſhaking is excited; then the vital ſpirit geting ſtrength again, this matter growing hot in the Blood, begins to be ſubdued, and inkindled in the heart; from whoſe deflagration, an intenſe heat is diffuſed thorough the whole body; then its reliques being ſeparated, and involved with <hi>ſerum,</hi> are ſent away by ſweat.</p>
                     <p>This torrid Conſtitution of the Blood, conſiſts in this, That 'tis impregnated more than it ought, with particles of Sulphur and Salt; wherefore, the Procatartick cauſes, which diſpoſe to this Diſeaſe, are an hot and bilous temperament, a youthful age, hot dyet, as an immoderate uſe of Wine and ſpiced Meats, but eſpecially in the Spring, and autumnal feafons of the year, when the Blood (as all vegetables) is apt to flower, and to ferment of its own accord. By reaſon of theſe occaſions, the liquor of the Blood, is want to be thorowly roaſted, and to be changed into a cholerick temper: and when it departs from its natural Diſpoſition, ſo much, that it perverts the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Juice, into a matter plainly Fermentative, the beginning of this Feaver is indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; which ſometimes happens from this intemperance, being leaſurely increaſed and brought to the height; but more frequently, an evident cauſe raiſes up this diſpoſition
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:152521:47"/>
into act, and we aſcribe the origine of this Diſeaſe to ſome notable Accident. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, lying on the Ground, or taking cold after ſweating, or tranſpiration being any ways hindred; alſo a Surfit, or a perturbation of the Stomach, from any thing inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately eaten; and laſtly, What things ſoever ſtir up an immoderate heat in the Blood, bring the lurking diſpoſition of this Diſeaſe into act: for that, from every ſuch occaſion, the nutritious Juice, being heaped in the Blood, and ſomewhat depraved, conceives a Flux, and departing from the reſt of the Blood, ferments with a nitrous ſharpneſs, then being inkindled and ſhaken by the Spirit, and vital heat, it induces the Fit, with a very ſtrong burning.</p>
                     <p>A Tertian Feaver, is wont to be more frequent in the Spring, at which time, the Blood is livelier and richer, and therefore more fitted for this kind of Feaveriſh diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. If this Feaver being taken, be ended within a moderate time, tis commonly ſaid to be a Medicine, rather than a Diſeaſe; which is partly true, becauſe, by this means, the impurities of the Blood burn out, the obſtructions of the Viſcera are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and in truth the whole body is ventilated, ſo that 'tis wholly freed from every Excrementitious matter, and the ſeminary of growing Diſeaſes. But if this Diſeaſe be long protracted, it becomes the cauſe of many Sickneſſes, and of a long want of Health. For from hence the maſs of the Blood is very much deprived of the vital Spirit, and (like Wine too much fermented) in a manner grows lifeleſs: wherefore the Jaundice, Scurvy, or Cachexia, follow this Feaver, being long er'e it be cured For by its frequent Fits, the vital Spirit very much evaporates, and becauſe it is but little reſtored by things eaten, the Blood therefore becomes weaker, and almoſt without life: In the mean time, the particles of Salt, and Sulphur, are carried forth more, and exalted; from whence, the Blood is made ſharp, and ſalt, and ſo more unfit for Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Tranſpiration.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, This Diſeaſe being long protracted, oftentimes changes its Figure, and from a Tertian Feaver, becomes either a Quotidian, or ſometimes a Quartan: then ſometimes from either, it returns into a Tertian. The reaſon of this is, the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Blood being variouſly changed: which at firſt being ſharp, and bilous, had perverted the nutritious Juice, by that means, that it ariſe to a fulneſs of ſwelling up on the third day; afterwards, by the frequent Deflagration, becoming leſs ſharp, or in truth more wateriſh, it grows far weaker as to its Conſtitution, ſo that it doth very little, or not at all aſſimulate the nouriſhable humor, and ripen it, and by that means, the increaſe of the Fermentative matter is made ſooner, and the Fits return daily: or elſe, the Blood from a ſharp and bilous intemperance, (the conſtitution of the Heaven, or the year, bringing on this alteration) is changed into an auſtere, or ſaltiſh, and therefore more ſlowly perverts the nouriſhing Juice, and the increaſe of the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh matter, gathering together more ſlowly, it doth not conceive the Fits till on the fourth day: but if either, by the means of Phyſick or Dyet, the temper of the Blood is reduced from either Dyſcraſie, towards a bilous, the periods alſo are altered, and they reſume the figure of a Tertian.</p>
                     <p>Certain ſymptoms are wont to come upon a Tertian Feaver, which are commonly eſteemed for the Criſes of this Diſeaſe; and in truth ſometimes, theſe appearing, the Diſtemper either clearly ceaſes, or begins to abate of its wonted fierceneſs. But theſe kind of ſigns, are chiefly theſe three, <hi>viz.</hi> The Eryſipelas, or an Eruption of pimples in the Lips, the yellow Jaundice, and an Inflamation, or ſwelling ſuddenly excited, in this or that part of the body: very often there happens after three or four Fits to the Sick, little ulcers, with a cruſty ſcab, to break forth about the Lips, and altho there be no coming away of any matter, in all the body beſide, yet from hence they preſage, that the Feaver is about to depart, which ſometimes the event proves true. But indeed ſometimes, I have obſerved, that the hoped for effect has not ſucceeded, but that the Feaver pertinaciouſly, and for a long while hath afflicted them, when their Lips have been broken out. But as to what reſpects this Symptom, it ſeems to ariſe, for that the Blood having got a more free Diaphoreſis, it not only thruſts forth adoors, the more thin, and ſmokie recrements, but alſo the more thick; and when the ſame, in other parts more eaſily exhale thorow the more open Pores, they ſtick in their paſſage about the Lips, by reaſon of the skin being more ſtrictly bound together; and becauſe the vaporous matter, abounds in particles of aduſt Salt, and Sulphur, being fixed in the skin, it there hinders Circulation, and therefore induces Puſtles, and little Ulcers; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the more hot breath, which is breathed forth from the mouth, and noſtrils, may contribute ſomething to this Diſtemper, foraſmuch as it ſcorches, and burns the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:152521:47"/>
Blood, and Juices flowing thither: wherefore, it may be ſaid, That this eruption of Puſtles, denotes only a more full Diaphoreſis in the whole, by which, the more thick, as well as the thin recrements of the aduſt Blood, evaporate forth of doors. For I have known in ſome, from a Tertian Feaver, little welks like the ſmall Pox to break out in their whole body, that if by this more plentiful Ventilation, as it were a purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Blood be ſo freed, that it recovers its priſtine diſpoſition, the Feaver is cured: But if (as ſometimes it happens) ſome recrements, tho more thick, break forth, yet others ſtay within, and ſtill cheriſh the Feaveriſh diſpoſition, thoſe little Ulcers, argue only a greater taint of the Blood, and pertinacy of the Diſeaſe, therefore it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, when that ſcabs break out in the lips, if the Feaver does not preſently abate, that it will be more grievous, and tedious for the future.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the yellow Jaundice comes upon a Tertian Feaver, and cures it; (which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> has alſo taken notice of) the reaſon of which is, becauſe, when the Blood has got a ſharp or bilous diſpoſition; that therefore it had perverted the alible Juice, and from thence had heaped together excrementitious matter, it is oftentimes freed by that Dyſcraſie, when by a ſudden Secretion, the recrements of aduſt Salt and Sulphur, are more plentiful purged forth. This the Choleduct veſſels being irritated by Phyſick, or of their own accord, and ſo pouring out plentifully the Bile, from the Blood, do often perform: becauſe Vomiting, Purging, and eſpecially a Diarrhea or Lask, very much conduce to the cure of this Diſeaſe, yea ſometimes, the Blood it ſelf, putting forth of its own accord, thruſts forth the bilous recrements, as its off-ſcourings, and in the circulating puts them forth in the skin, and ſo inducing the yellow Jaundice, cures this Feaver.</p>
                     <p>When an Inflamation, (as ſometimes tis wont) comes upon this Diſtemper, the Ague is commonly ſaid to fall down into the part diſtempered with the Tumor. But that by ſuch a breaking forth, this Diſeaſe is cured, 'tis no wonder; becauſe the Blood by this means continually lays aſide out of his boſom, the proviſion of the degenerate nutritious Juice, and transfers it to the diſtempered part; and therefore, the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and fermentative matter in the maſs of Blood, does not eaſily ariſe to a fulneſs of ſwelling up: wherefore, the Belly being perpetually looſe, hath by degrees helped ſome, for that the Blood by this means, readily caſts forth its burthen, now growing low, and not having a more full increaſe yielded to it: ſometimes alſo, a Deafneſs ſuddenly ariſing, the Tertian Feaver has preſently ceaſed, to wit, by reaſon of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual tranſlation of the Feaveriſh matter, from the boſom of the Blood, into the head.</p>
                     <p>If that the Tertian Feaver, within a ſhort time, neither by the free accord of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, declines by degrees, that it doth clearly ceaſe within ſeven or ten periods, nor is cured by any of the aforeſaid means, nor is removed by the help of Medicine, but that after ten or twelve Fits, the ſick are ſtill grievouſly afflicted, it will be a very hard task to cure it: becauſe the Blood, from the continual heaping of the Feaveriſh mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by the frequent burnings, becomes at length ſo depraved, that it concocts no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing truly for the nouriſhment of the Body, and for the ſuſtaining its ſtrength; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it able to ſhake thorowly out of its boſom, the impurities and excrements, whereby the Diſeaſe may make a Criſis or ſeparation, but in truth, the ſame growing in ſtrength every day, the Blood, beſides its Dyſcraſie or evil diſpoſition, begins to be hurt ſomewhat in its mixture; wherefore, more frequent Fits infeſt them, nor does a perfect Remiſſion come between, but that the ſick being very weak and languiſhing, are almoſt continually Feaveriſh, with thirſt and heat: when it is come to this paſs, unleſs they are ſuccour'd by remedies from Art, or that the change of the Place, and Air, bring timely help, this Diſeaſe often ends in death.</p>
                     <p>As to its cure: the method of healing is commonly directed to this one ſcope, to wit, that the mine of the Diſeaſe may be extirpated, and that the Feaveriſh matter may be eradicated out of our Body, without any cheriſher remaining, or fear of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing; wherefore, Vomits, and Purges are diligently Inſtituted, which when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting nothing to the cure, but that the Patients ſtrength is very much broken, the ſick are left by the Phyſicians, and the buſineſs is wholly committed to Nature. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions (as it ſeems to me) ought to be of this ſort: Firſt, a reſtitution of the Blood, to its natural Temper. Secondly, a prevention of the depravation of the nouriſhing Juice, as much as may be. Thirdly, an Inhibition of the Feaveriſh Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that the Fit may not be excited. And theſe Indications take place, not only in a Tertian Feaver, but in any other intermitting Feaver beſides: which yet are to be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:152521:48"/>
performed, not by the ſame ways and remedies, but by ſeveral, according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Diſeaſe, of the condition of the ſick, and of the ſymptoms chiefly urging. However in the curing of this Diſeaſe, there is more to be attributed to Nature, and to a good order of Dyet, or way of Living, than to Phyſick.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Concerning the firſt Intention, to wit, that the Blood may be reduced to its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Temper, Vomits, letting of Blood, and Purging are of great uſe: eſpecially, if they be celebrated in the beginning of the Diſeaſe. <hi>Vomitories</hi> help, both for that they Purge the Ventricle, that the firſt Concoction may be better performed, and by that means the nouriſhing Chyme may be more purely ſupplyed, for matter of the Blood; but chiefly, for that by plentifully preſſing forth the Bile, from the Choleduct paſſage, they empty the Galiſh bag, as by that means, the Bile is poured forth more full from the maſs of Blood; and ſo the Blood is purified, from the recrements of aduſt Salt and Sulphur. The opening of a Vein cools and ventilates the Blood, as by that means, tis leſs torrified, or ſcorched, and is circulated more freely in the Veſſels, without danger of burning. Alſo Purging, plentifully draws forth, and by provoking expreſſes, or ſqueeſes out, the Bile, from the galiſh Veſſels, and conſequently from the maſs of Blood. For this end, (to wit, the reduction of the Blood) Digeſtives bring help, the more temperate Vinegars, or Acetous things foraſmuch as they fuſe, and alter the Blood, and do attemper its fervor. Somtimes alſo, the change of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he Soil, and Air, notably amends the evil conſtitution of the Blood, before all other Remedies whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Intention, is excellently performed, by Dyet, and an exact manner of living; which in this Diſeaſe ought to be ſlender and ſparing: wherefore it is commonly ſaid, Starving is the beſt Remedy for this Diſeaſe: and it appears by common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that by a more ſpare eating, the coming of the Ague fit, is very often prolonged, beyond its wonted Cuſtom. There are eſpecially two things to be obſerved, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eating and Drinking: The firſt, that the food be ſlender, that nothing Sulphureous or Spirituous be given, for ſo the Conflagration of the Blood will be leſſened; then ſecondly, that the Fit approaching, or urging, nothing of Aliment be taken, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in faſting the Fit is lighter, and ſooner finiſhed.</p>
                     <p>As to the third thing propoſed; the Inhibition of the Feaveriſh Fit, is inſtituted by Remedies, which ſtay the Fermentation of the Blood. But tho this Remedy ſeems Empirical, and unmethodical, and very failable to Phyſicians, yet I have found theſe Feavers to be very often cured by this means, when Medicines have profited nothing: What they are, and by what means, without the ſuſpicion of Witchcraft, they afford help, for the curing this Diſeaſe, is before noted. We ſhall here only advertiſe you, that the uſe of theſe is moſt profitable after Phyſick, and opening a Vein, if there be need of it; and unleſs theſe be rightly performed before-hand, thoſe other rarely ſtop the Fit. But Vomiting, Purging, and breathing a Vein, unleſs they be preſently cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated after the beginning, yield little help, yea, more often are wont to hinder: For whilſt the Blood is ſtrong in vital ſpirit, its evil diſpoſition, may with eaſie labour be corrected, or amended: wherefore, if the Bile, about the beginning, be copiouſly drawn forth, or the Blood eventilated, it is reduced to its natural Complexion; but afterwards, in the progreſs of this Diſeaſe (the Spirit being now very much exhauſted, and the Salt and Sulphur too much exalted) if theſe kind of Evacuations be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, they do more debilitate the diſpoſition of the Blood: and therefore it is clear by obſervation, that the Tertian Feaver, is rarely or never cured, by theſe Remedies late adminiſtred, and often paſſes into a Quotidian. I my ſelf have known ſome, in the Spring time, being ſtrong in very good health, from a more ſtrong Emetick taken for prevention ſake, cauſing a violence by the Evacuation, to have preſently fallen into a Tertian Feaver; and others, for ſome time cured of this Feaver, when they had taken a ſtrong Purge, for the carrying away of the remains of the Feaveriſh matter, upon it to have fallen into a Relapſe. It may be readily ſaid, that the mine of the Diſeaſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before at quiet, was ſtirred up, and brought into Act, after this manner by the Medicine: But if you conſider this thing rightly, it may rather be ſaid, that from the ſtrong Medicine, the diſpoſition of the Blood was very much hurt, and when at firſt it was prone to a bilous Dyſcraſie, that it hardly did aſſimilate the alible Juice, from this evident cauſe, it forthwith degenerated, that it wholy perverted the Nutriment, into a Fermentative matter, and ſo conceived the Feaveriſh diſpoſition. It is a common opinion, that a Tertian Feaver can ſcarce be cured, without a Vomit, wherefore ſome Medicaſters, are wont under the pretext of the neceſſity, to give to all whatſoever,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:152521:48"/>
labouring with this Diſeaſe (tho languiſhing and weak) an Emetick Medicine not without great danger of life: and thoſe whom they judge wholy unfit for ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, they leave as not eaſily cureable to Nature. But (as I have often found the contrary by experience) this ſort of practice is evilly inſtituted; yea, I rather judge, for the cureing of a Tertian Feaver, that Vomits are rarely or never to be required, unleſs in a ſtrong Body, and very eaſily prone to Vomiting, and when the Ventricle happens to be burthened, with excrementitious matter, but inſtead of it, that a gentle Purge, by which the load of the humors may be pleaſantly brought away, may be of better uſe: becauſe, a Purge in this caſe, doth the ſame thing as a Vomit, to wit, it evacuates the choleduct Veſſels, that the Bile, being plentifully exhauſted from the Blood, the Feaveriſh Dyſcraſie is mended. But when the galiſh humor, being empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth into the Ventricle, is caſt out upwards, from thence there is great hurt brought to the ſtomach, and a mighty perturbation excited in the whole Body: But if that humour be inticed downwards by a gentle Purge, it is ſent forth of doors, without any trouble. Then, if to a gentle Purge, once or twice repeated, be added a very ſlender dyet, without fleſh it often anſwers the preſervatory Indication, that there needs no other Remedies, for the taking away the cauſe of this Diſeaſe; but that theſe being rightly performed, ſhall render beneficial thoſe things, which being either inwardly taken, or outwardly applyed, ſtop the Feaveriſh acceſſion. By this ſort of plain and eaſie inſtitution of Medicine, <hi>viz.</hi> A Purge of the infuſion of Senna, and Rhubarb, a ſlender dyet, and a Febrifuge or Ague-reſiſting Topick, laid either to the wriſts, or the breaſt, I have known very often, and in a very ſhort time, Tertian Feavers cured, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uſe of any other deſtroying Phyſick: yea, a thin dyet only, with Amulets timely adminiſtred, hath very happily cured Big-bellied women, and alſo very weak old men, whoſe ſtrength could not bear Purging. I have ſo often made tryal of this method, with good ſucceſs, that I doubt not, but that a Tertian Feaver, may as eaſily be cured, as any other Diſeaſe, if it be at the begining handled after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> before the temper of the Blood be more hurt, by an evil manner of Dyet, or by Medicine untowardly adminiſtred. For the truth of this thing, I will relate this following Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>A certain noble young man, indued with a bilous Temper, had caught an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Tertian Feaver; upon the approach of the Fit, he Vomited forth much yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and greeniſh Choler, then he was troubled moſt grievouſly, for many hours, with a great pain of the Heart, and moſt ſtrong Heat and Thirſt. On the day of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion there was taken from this perſon, with whom I was by chance, by my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, eight ounces of Blood, and in the afternoon was given an Emollient Glyſter, he alſo uſed a moſt ſlender Dyet, (<hi>viz.</hi> only made of Barly) He took every night going to ſleep, this Opiate, <hi>viz.</hi> Conſerve of Roſes vitriolated half a dram, of Diaſcordium a ſcruple, alſo every morning of the Salt of Wormwood a ſcruple, in a ſpoonful of the Juice of Orange: but when theſe did not ſucceed (for the Fit returned ſomwhat more remiſs, but with cruel Vomiting, as at firſt) beſides, for that this ſick perſon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly abhor'd a Vomitory Medicine, (becauſe not long before this, from a very gentle Emetick, he had Vomited almoſt thirty times, until being diſtempered with the Cramp, and Convulſions, he was brought into great weakneſs, with hazard of his life) therefore, the day following the aforeſaid Fit, I gave him a Potion of an infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Senna, Rhubarb, and yellow Sanders, with Salt of Wormwood, in Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, by which he was Purged ten times, with eaſe: In the morning after, and three hours before he expected the Fit, I put to his wriſts an Ague-reſiſting Medicine, and took from him ſix ounces of Blood, by which means, he miſt his Feaveriſh Fit, and then being again Purged after the ſame manner, became perfectly well.</p>
                     <p>If that the Tertian Feaver, by reaſon of the evil Conſtitution of the ſick, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of errors in Dyet, or committed by Phyſick, hath more deeply rooted it ſelf, that after a long ſickneſs, the Fits ſtill grow worſe, and the ſick extreamly languiſh, with want of Strength, Thirſt, and almoſt continual Heat, want of Appetite, wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, weak Pulſe, high colour'd Urine, and very full of Contents, the Curatory method ought to be a little otherways inſtituted; In this caſe, firſt it is to be endeavour'd, that the Dyſcraſie of the Blood, may be taken away; wherefore, the ſick are to be fed, with ſlender Aliments only, as Barly broth, or Grewel, with opening Roots boiled in it, (fleſh-broth being wholly laid aſide) the Belly is to be kept looſe, (if need be) with the uſe of Emollient Clyſters; beſides (Purges being omitted) only digeſtive Medicines, which fuſe the Blood, and bring away gently the ſerous Impurities by
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:152521:49"/>
Urine, alſo comforting Remedies, which corroborate the Viſcera, and cheriſh the Spirits, are chiefly to be inſiſted on. To this end, Apozems are fitly to be prepared, of Herbs, and Roots gently Diuretic, alſo Opiats help very much, of temperate Conſerves, with <hi>Sal</hi> Nitre, or the fixed Salt of Herbs, with ſhelly powders, and the Spirit of Vitriol mixed together. When the diſpoſition of the Blood is ſomwhat mended, that the Urine is clearer, and leſs coloured, alſo ſleep quieter, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of thirſt, and heat following; then may be profitably adminiſtred, Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to ſtop the Feaveriſh fit: wherefore Ague-reſiſting Amulets may be applyed to the Wriſts or to the Soles of the Feet; alſo the powder of Peruvian Bark, or of ſomthing inſtead of it, or alſo of the Barks of the Aſh-Tree, Tamarisk, or Gentian, with Salts mixed with them, and drunk in White-Wine: after the comings of the fits are taken away, and the ſick being to get ſtrength, and deſire Food, and in ſome meaſure to digeſt it, gentle Purges may be of uſe: but let the ſick ſtill abſtain, from a more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Diet, or participating of Fleſh, and they will ſhortly after recover perfect Health, without any violent Purge or Phlebotomy.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Quotidian Intermitting Feaver.</head>
                     <p>BEcauſe of its affinity to the Tertian Feaver, and likeneſs of fits, the Quotidian (or dayly) Feaver comes next, <hi>viz.</hi> whoſe Acceſſion is wont to return every day. It is the opinion of ſome, that this ſort of Feaver, is only a double Tertian, and doth ariſe from a diſperſed matter, having gotten a twofold Neſt; to which I cannot aſſent, and I ſuppoſe its begining is to be attributed, to a peculiar Dyſcraſie of the Blood. In this the ſymptoms of cold and heat, are more remiſs, but its fit is longer continued, and oftentimes it is wont to laſt eighteen or twenty hours: This Feaver for the moſt part follows a Tertian, for when the Vital Spirit is very much flown away, by the frequent deflagration of the Blood, and (the Feaver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh diſpoſition ſtill remaining) the Blood is made weaker, it doth not concoct the nouriſhing Juice, or ripen it, but perverts almoſt the whole into a Fermentative mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; wherefore it comes ſooner to its increaſe, and is gathered together to a plenitude of ſwelling up, within double the time, than at firſt. But becauſe the congeſted mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, participates equally of crudity, and aduſtion, therefore the heat of the burning is leſſer, and more unequal, and (like green wood laid on the fire) ſlowly burns; for which reaſon the fit endures longer.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes it happens, that a Quotidian Feaver, doth ariſe without a Tertian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, <hi>viz.</hi> when a Feaveriſh diſpoſition, falls upon a Cacochymic Body, or full of evil humors, and ſtuffed with depraved Juices; for then the Blood, being poor in Spirits, perverts in a greater meaſure the nutritious Juice, and in a ſhorter time, gathers to a fulneſs of ſwelling up: But that which begins an every days Ague, oftentimes changes its figure, and becomes a Tertian; juſt as a Tertian, often goes into a Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian, becauſe between theſe Feavers, and their cauſes, there is a great vicinity; and the conſtitution of the Blood being a little changed, it makes a tranſition from one to another. A Quotidian Intermitting Feaver, is not ſo eaſily cured as a Tertian: For whether it comes at firſt ſimple, or follows upon another Intermitting Feaver, it is ſtill excited from a ſtronger cauſe, and argues a greater dyſcraſie of the Blood, which will not preſently give way to Remedies. But alſo, if this Feaver be of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, or comes upon another Chronical Diſeaſe, it has moſt often adjoyned to it, beſides the taint of the Blood, the infirmities of the inwards: to wit, the Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoiled, eaſily affixeth its impurities, by degrees heaped up, on the Viſcera, whilſt it paſſes through their Meanders: from hence it is, that in a Quotidian Feaver, the weight of the Ventricle, an extenſion of the Hypochondria, Obſtructions, or Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, now of the Liver, now of the Spleen, or Meſentery, are joyned together; but theſe kind of diſtempers, are not the cauſe of the Feaver, (as is commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved) but only its product. Wherefore, in this Feaver, beſides the ſimple method
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:152521:49"/>
of Cure, which is ſhown in the Tertian, many other intentions or coindications, come under conſideration: to wit, that the Ventricle be cleanſed from its load of humors, the ſtuffings of the Inwards freed, Infirmities corroborated; and that toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with theſe, the Dyſcraſie of the Blood may be mended, and the Acceſſions of the Feaver may be reſtrained, muſt by all means be endeavoured; from whence, by reaſon of theſe kind of various intentions, we come to the Cure by a longer way: In this caſe, Vomits (if ſtrength will bear them) are of benefit before all other Medicines: alſo Purges, whereby the aſſiduous ſupply of Excrementitious matter, may be drawn forth, are often to be repeated: Beſides theſe, digeſtive Remedies, openers of Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſuch as reſtore the Ferment of the Viſcera, and Blood, and correct their evil diſpoſitions, are frequently to be adminiſtred. Wherefore, the fixed Salts of Herbs, and their Extracts, Acid Spirits of Minerals, and ſomtimes preparations of Steel, do very much help: concerning theſe main things, the task will be hard, when by reaſon of the manifold evil, many things are to be done together, yet by reaſon of the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity of the Feaveriſh fit, there is leiſure for the ſick to uſe few only. In Diſtempers ſo complicated, tho the reaſon of the method requires, the impediments to be firſt removed, and then to Cure the Diſeaſe, yet I have known, this kind of Feaver, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with many other diſtempers, in a Body full of humors, often Cured, without method, and by an Empirical way; <hi>viz.</hi> after a light proviſion of the whole, Ague-reſiſting Remedies being outwardly applyed, have at firſt ſtopped the Feaveriſh fit, that then there was time, for the Curing the other diſtempers, and more happy occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of healing were granted. I lately viſited a Noble Lady, who being long indued with a Cachectical habit of Body, a month after her lying in, being weak and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, was taken with a quotidian Intermitting Feaver; after ſix or ſeven fits of it, her ſtrength was ſo much caſt down, that ſhe could ſcarce riſe out of, or ſit up in her Bed; nor able to take never ſo little Food, tho very ſlender, but upon it, moſt grievous moleſtations were raiſed up, in her ſtomach; beſides, the Region of her Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, and left Hypochondrium, was wholly beſet, with a hard ſhining tumor, and cruelly painful: by reaſon of her ſtrength being mightily caſt down, there was no place left for Evacuation, but the uſe of Clyſters; alſo her Stomach, being very weak, loathed all other Remedies, unleſs very grateful, and only in a very ſmall quantity. In this difficult caſe, circumſcribed between narrow limits of Curing, I counſelled theſe few things, to wit, that twice in a day, ſhe ſhould take this mixture, <hi>viz.</hi> The magiſterial water of Earth-worms two Ounces, of Elixer Proprietatis twelve drops. Moreover, I ordered to be applyed to her Ventricle, a Fomentation, of the Leaves of Sea-Wormwood, Centaury, Southernwood, with the Roots of Gentian, boiled in White-Wine, in an open Veſſel: alſo, that after the Fomentation, a Cake of Toſted-Bread, and dipped in the ſame Liquor, ſhould be worn upon her Stomach; beſides, Ague-reſiſting Medicines were ordered for her wriſts; and with theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies only, ſhe miſt her Ague fit, on the third day, and remained free from it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; then, by the uſe of Chalybeat Remedies, ſhe became perfectly well, within a ſhort time.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of a Quartan Feaver.</head>
                     <p>IN a Quartan Feaver, the period is longer than in the reſt; to wit, which is extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the fourth day incluſively; alſo its continuance uſes to be longer, and its cure harder: becauſe this Diſeaſe is protracted for many months, yea, oftentimes for years, and ſeldom, or ſcarce at all, is cured by Medicines.</p>
                     <p>The Fit, for the moſt part, begins with cold, and ſhaking, to which a very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome heat ſucceeds, but more remiſs than in a Tertian: Sweat for the moſt part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the Fit. At the firſt coming of the Diſeaſe, the Fits are more grievous, and very infeſtous, and keep the ſick in their Beds; yea, they make them loſe their ſtrength, and vigour of Body: But afterwards, the trouble is more eaſily born, ſo that the Fits are ſuffer'd out of Bed, and ſomtimes in a Journy, or being about any buſineſs. If it continue long, it induces the Scurvy, or Hypochondriac diſtemper, and involves men in an unhealthful condition.</p>
                     <p>The cauſes which diſpoſe to this Diſeaſe, are firſt, the conſtitution of the Soil and Air, becauſe this Diſtemper is proper to the fall of the Leaf, or Autumn, that you rarely find this Feaver to begin, but about that time: alſo in ſome places, eſpecially about the Sea-coaſts, this uſes to be general, or common to the Region, and to come upon thoſe living there, or Strangers coming thither from elſewhere. A declining age, which is paſt its <hi>acme</hi> or height, alſo a melancholick Temper, and which, by reaſon of an ill manner of living, is obnoxious to the Hypochondriac Diſtemper, cauſe this: beſides, long Feavers of another kind, and Chronical Diſeaſes, often paſs into a Quartan Feaver.</p>
                     <p>According to theſe poſitions, and rightly weighed, it may be ſaid, that a Quartan Feaver, even as the other intermitting Feavers, depends upon a vitious diſpoſition of the Blood; to wit, becauſe the nutritious Juice, being by degrees delated into the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, is perverted into a Fermentative matter; and the efferveſcency of this, heaped up even to a fulneſs of ſwelling over, conſtitutes the Fit of the Quartan Feaver. But as in this Feaver, there are ſome things, which are peculiar from the reſt, we will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what kind of Dyſcraſie of the Blood it is in this Diſeaſe, diſtinct from the others, and by what means it excites, the very remarkable Symptoms.</p>
                     <p>The opinion, which is commonly had concerning this thing, is very far from truth: almoſt by the conſent of all, the Eſſence and beginning of a Quartan Feaver, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to a melancholick humour, heaped up ſomwhere in the firſt paſſages, and there periodically Putrifying. Inſtead of this, we affirm, that in this Diſeaſe, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of the Blood, doth paſs from a ſweet, ſpirituous, and balſamick, into an acid, and ſomwhat auſtere Nature, like Wine growing ſowre: to wit, there is too great a want of Spirits, and the Terreſtrial, or Tartareous part of the Blood, (which conſiſts chiefly of Salt, and Earth) is too much exalted, and being carried forth into a Flux, induces the ſourneſs of the maſs of Blood. Even as Beer, being diſturbed by Thunder, and infected with a troubled lee or dregs, grows ſour. The Blood, after this manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, from its native diſpoſition, doth not rightly dreſs the alible Juice, and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milate it to it ſelf, but perverts it into an extraneous matter; with which, when it is ſatisfied to a fulneſs, in the veſſels, and the nervous parts are watered by the Juice, from thence ariſing, a Flux of this matter, and as it were a ſpontaneous effervency follows, by which indeed, the Feaveriſh Fit is induced, with ſhivering and heat, as is wont to be in a Tertian.</p>
                     <p>In a Quartan Feaver, the periods have longer intervals, becauſe, when the Dyſcraſie of the Blood is become ſouriſh, and therefore leſs violent and hot, it perverts the alible Juice without ſtrife, or tumult: wherefore, it aſſimilates ſome of it, and the deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reſt, does not ſo far recede from its natural ſtate, as in a Tertian, and from hence, its congeſtion to a plenitude, is made longer, and almoſt in another half of that time, in which a Tertian riſes up to a Turgeſcency: And therefore, thoſe taken with this Feaver, are indifferently well, and are ſtrong; which is a ſign, that the nutritious
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:152521:50"/>
Juice is leſs depraved; alſo, the Fits are made without cruel burning, becauſe the nutritious humor, is perverted into a fermentative matter, without great aduſtion.</p>
                     <p>But why this Diſeaſe is ſo hard to be cured, and ſo pertinaciouſly infeſts the ſick, the cauſe is, the melancholic conſtitution of the Blood, which is not eaſily to be taken away, and yields almoſt to no Remedies. The cholerick diſpoſition of the Blood, is mended by the frequent Deflagration, and ceaſes often of its own accord, even as too rich Wines are depreſſed, by their own growing hot, and are wont to be reduced into their due ſtate: but this melancholick Dyſcraſie of the Blood, in which, with a want and defect of Spirits, Salt and Earth are too much exalted, (as when Wines grow ſour) is moſt hard to be reſtored, and is almoſt of the ſame labour and difficulty, as to put again life, and a vinous Spirit, into Vinegar: For that the Blood, depraved after this manner, may be reſtored, it will be needful, that its whole maſs ſhould be volatili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and as it were made Spiritual anew: wherefore, in this caſe, evacuations profit not a jot, yea, by more depauperating the Blood, oftentimes the ſtrength is caſt down, beyond help: but they had need to exalt, and make volatile what is fixed, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a Tranſpiration, or Spiritualiſation, in the whole maſs of Blood: From hence it is, that in this Diſeaſe, the change of the Air and Region, moſt often brings help, before all other Remedies: For the Spring following, oftentimes takes away thoſe Quartan Feavers, that had ariſen the Autumn before: which without doubt happens, becauſe the changed condition of the Air, is wont to alter for the better, the evil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Blood: alſo for the ſame reaſon, the change of the place, moſt often cures this Diſtemper, inexpugnable to all Phyſick.</p>
                     <p>If it be demanded, wherefore this Diſeaſe chiefly begins in the Autumn; and rarely in the Spring, or Summer time; I ſay, the Autumnal time doth moſt fitly produce this kind of Feaveriſh diſpoſition of the Blood, for when very much of the Spirit, and Sulphur, hath flown away by the Summers heat, and that what is left begins to be bound up by the cold; the Liquor of the Blood, (as Wine growing ſour by too much heat) eaſily degenerates into a ſaltiſh, and acidulous or ſharp Nature: This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, the Sea air, by infecting the Blood and Spirits, with ſaline Vapours falling on them, eaſily procures: yea, alſo the affinity of this Diſeaſe, with the Scurvy, and Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driac diſtemper, plainly ſhews, the evil diſpoſition of the Blood to be in fault, whereby it becomes ſalt, and earthy, with the want of Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Quartan Feavers, the laſt year was ſo abundantly fruitful of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that many might collect by ocular Inſpection, whatever belong to this Diſeaſe; for when the moſt hot Summer was paſt, about the end of it, an Epidemical Feaver (of which in another place you ſhall have a deſcription) followed; then the Autumn coming on, when that Diſeaſe had ceaſed, a Quartan Feaver began very much to rage; that in very many places, the fourth part of the people was taken with it: neither did it only infeſt old men, ſplenitick and melancholick men, but of every age and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, alſo Infants, Children, and young men ordinarily: which was clearly a ſign, that this Diſtemper had drawn its riſe, not from a melancholick humour, heaped up, by the default of the Spleen, but from the Dyſcraſie of the Blood, brought in, through the intemperance of the year: for the maſs of the Blood, after too great heats, even as Wines after immoderate efferveſcencies, was made fit to grow ſomwhat ſour, or to get an auſtere diſpoſition, and ſo alſo prone to this ſort of Feaver, as is already ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>If the Remedies, which for the Curing of this, have been made tryal of, both by Phyſicians and Empericks, were collected together, their deſcription would ſwell into a great Volumn; but altho there is inſtituted, a manifold proviſion of Medicine, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this evil, yet very few are cured in the Autumn. In ſome, about the begining of their ſickneſs, before the Diſeaſe has taken too deep root, a Vomit hath brought help; but in moſt, all manner of Cathartics, tho an hundred times repeated, have profited nothing. In whom the evil had deeply implanted it ſelf, the ſick received no help, from the moſt ſtudied Medicines made uſe of all the Autumn. But when at this time, I perceived the ordinary method of Medicine, was adminiſtred in vain, I propoſed to a Noble Virgin, requiring a ſudden Cure, by any means, to be performed, that if ſhe would indure a Flux at the Mouth, for ſome days, from a Mineral Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, by that means, it might be hoped, that the Diſeaſe would be profligated. When ſhe had readily aſſented to this, I gave her a gentle, and very ſafe Medicine, by which a light ſpitting only was provoked, and that finiſhed within twelve days: As ſoon as the Salivation began, ſhe miſt her fits, but at thoſe times they were wont to come, ſhe felt a perturbation in her whole Body, with an oppreſſion of the Heart, and dread
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:152521:51"/>
of ſwooning, but after the ſpitting was finiſhed, ſhe appear'd very well; and when again after two months ſpace, ſhe was troubled with ſome light fits of this Diſeaſe, from an Emetick pouder, twice or thrice taken, ſhe was wholly cured without relaps<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>After the winter Solſtice, this Diſeaſe began to rage leſs, and to ceaſe in ſome of its own accord, and in many others, to be eaſily expung'd by the uſe of Phyſick: becauſe at this time, the Dyſcraſie of the Blood, contracted by the Summers heat, is wont to be blotted out leiſurely, by reaſon of the cold of the Winter, and the maſs of Blood growing old, as it were to put off its old ſpoils, and to be reduced towards its natural State. But thoſe, who were of a melancholick temper, or had their viſcera, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Spleen, evilly affected, or that uſed an ill manner of Dyet, received no change at this Tropick, but to the next period of the year, <hi>viz.</hi> to the vernal Equinox, or the Spring, kept the Diſeaſe; and then in moſt, the Blood being either reſtored of it ſelf, or its intemperance more eaſily mended by the uſe of Remedies, this Diſtemper was ſeen to be overcome: But in the mean time, many old men, and ſuch as were full of evil humours, or otherways unhealthy, ordinarily dyed, in all that ſpace of time, of this Diſeaſe; alſo ſome liv'd, who could not ſhake off its yoak, tho the Summer Solſtice were paſt. But altho very many had labour'd with this Feaver, as it were Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, almoſt thorow the whole year, yet none (that I know) contracted it firſt in the Spring, and very few grew well of it during the Autumn, that in truth, I do not doubt, the Dyſcraſie of the Blood, to be the cauſe of this, and the cure to conſiſt in the change of it.</p>
                     <p>The Remedies, which moſt often brought help, (as appeared at leaſt to our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) were of this ſort, which did reſtrain the Feaveriſh Fit: for the evils of the diſpoſition of the Blood, being ſomwhat mended, by the time of the year, being changed, if now the habitual cuſtom of the Fits were broken off, Nature recollected her ſelf, and eaſily recover'd the priſtine ſtate of health, by her own endeavour. And this kind of intention, (to wit, the inhibition of the Fits) tho ſomtimes performed by Vomits, given a little before the coming of the Fit, (for theſe did not rarely ſtop the Feaveriſh motion of the Blood, by raiſing up another motion contrary to this) yet this Indication is far more certainly, and indeed happily effected, by the uſe of thoſe kind of Medicines, which do not altogether evacuate from the Viſcera, but induce, either a certain fixation to the Blood, or a precipitation of the Feaveriſh matter, for a time. Wherefore, thoſe whom I undertook to cure, in the Spring, and afterwards; I handled (and in moſt with good ſucceſs) with this method; a proviſion being made of the whole, ſomtimes with an Emetic Medicine, ſomtimes with a Solutive; I was wont three hours before the Fit, to lay a peculiar Ague-Medicine to the wriſts, and together, to give them to drink in Sack, an Ague-reſiſting pouder, and to order the ſick to be kept in Bed in a gentle ſweat: It ſeldom hapned, but at the firſt, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, the Feaveriſh Fit, was by this means reſtrained, and then, by the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, ſomtimes reiterated, the Diſeaſe at laſt wholly ceaſed. To this kind of practice, (beſides our experience) the uſe of the pouder, of a certain Bark, brought of late from the Indies, ſeems to give ſome Faith, and approbation; which is ſaid, moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to cure this Diſeaſe; but the vertue, or operation of this, without any evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſiſts in this only, that it hinders the coming of the Feaveriſh Fits.</p>
                     <p>Concerning this Peruvian Bark, becauſe of late it hath begun to be in uſe, there are ſome things to be ſaid, which offer themſelves to common obſervation. The common manner of exhibiting this is, that two drams of it beaten to pouder, be infuſed in Sack, or Whitewine, in an open Glaſs, for two hours, and then upon the coming of the Fit, the Patient being put to Bed, that the liquor and pouder be drunk up. This potion often takes away the approaching Fit, yet oftentimes tho taken after the wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manner, it prevents the next, however, either in the firſt, ſecond, or third period, the Fit is inhibited, and the Diſeaſe ſeems to be cured, it is often wont to return, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in twenty or thirty days; then this pouder being again exhibited, the Diſeaſe is for a time deferred about the ſame ſpace, and by this means, I have known many ſick of a Quartan, to have ſuffered ſome few Fits only, a whole Autumn, and Winter, and ſo to have detained the enemy in his precincts, till the Spring coming on, the diſpoſition of the Blood is altered, for the better, by the help of the time of year, and of other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and ſo this diſtemper vaniſhes by degrees. Thoſe who by this means, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured theſe frequent truces of the Quartan, have liv'd chearful, lively, and ready for any buſineſs, when otherwiſe, being weak, and pale, they were brought into languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:152521:51"/>
and a vitious habit of Body: ſcarce one of an hundred, hath tryed this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine in vain, yea, if but half, or a leſſer quantity, <hi>viz.</hi> the weight of but one dram, taken, it very often takes away the Fits, and ſuſpends the ſame, a ſhorter ſpace only; neither is it any matter, whether it be taken in ſtrong, or ſmall Wine, unleſs with the reſpect, to the diſpoſition of the ſick: becauſe in a more hot temper, it may be profitably taken in diſtilled Water, or Whey; alſo, a clear infuſion of it, the more thick ſubſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt away, produces the like effect, but of ſhorter durance: I have taken care to reduce this powder into Pills, with the mucilage of Tragacanth, with a little coſt to the ſick, to be given to ſome; after what manner ſoever it is taken, unleſs, to thoſe loathing and abhorring every Medicine, it cauſes no manifeſt evacuation, and takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Fit, almoſt from all; neither is it only in a Quartan Feaver, but in the other kinds of intermitting Feavers, to wit, in every one where there is any remiſſion coming between, given with good ſucceſs. It is commonly ordered, that a gentle Purge ſhould be taken before this, but in ſome who are very weak, and keep their Beds, this powder being taken carefully, without any previous Medicine, hath procured laudable effects. In the mean time, I will ingeniouſly confeſs, that I have not ſeen an intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Feaver quite cured, by this Bark, once taken: nay, rather the Fits not only of a Quartan, but of a Tertian, and Quotidian Feaver, wholly overcome eaſily by other Remedies, ſeeming to be driven away by this powder, have conſtantly return'd after a ſhort time. For this Reaſon, they who ſuppreſs intermitting Feavers, otherways eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly curable, no neceſſity urging them, by this Medicine, for a little while, only ſeem to inſtitute a deceitful Medicine, and do no more than thoſe, who skin over a rotten Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, which will ſhortly break out again; in truth, in ſome caſes, the uſe of this will be requiſite, <hi>viz.</hi> when by the too great aſſiduity of the Fits, the ſpirits of the ſick are caſt down, truces are by this means procured, by which Nature may recollect her ſelf, and afterwards may be more able to fight againſt this potent Enemy: alſo, that a Quartan Feaver, during the Autumn and Winter, may paſs over with little trouble, this Bark is profitably adminiſtred: But thoſe, who expect a longer reſting time, from the aſſaults of this Feaver, are bid to take this powder in greater quantity, and more often, to wit, that they ſhould take two drams, three ſeveral times one after another, whether the Fits return or no; by this means, they remain longer free, yet they retain within, the Enemy ſtill, tho aſleep.</p>
                     <p>If it be demanded, concerning the Nature of this Bark, and the virtue in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the fits of Intermitting Feavers, it is not to be diſſembled, that 'tis very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to explicate the cauſes of theſe kind of effects, and the manner of working; becauſe, there is not found as yet in any Subject, beſides, the like efficacy; but from a ſingular experiment, a general Reaſon is not to be rightly fitted: however, from the appearances diligently Collated, we will deduce ſome Theſes in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which may make at leaſt ſome ſteps towards, if not obtain the verity of this thing.</p>
                     <p>It is to be noted therefore, in the firſt place, that this Medicine, being inwardly taken, eſpecially exerciſeth its force and energy on the maſs of Blood; becauſe, it does not at all irritate the Viſcera, neither cauſes in them any excretion, or trouble; beſides, whilſt it communicates its virtue to the Blood, it doth not at all put forth An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifeaveriſh property; wherefore, not always the next following fit, but the ſecond, or the third, is prevented, by the ſame being taken: and for this reaſon, that it may ſooner affect the Blood, it is a uſual thing, to drink the Liquor, very much impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the ſame powder, for ſo its Particles are more eaſily conveyed into the maſs of Blood. Secondly, the virtue of this Bark, being impreſſed on the Blood, ſtays in it for ſome time, and that either ſhorter or longer, according as either a greater or leſſer portion of the Medicine was taken inwardly; for the Particles of this, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed with the Blood, are a long while circulated with it, and by how much the longer they ſtay, by ſo much the more they affect its maſs, and produce a longer effect: for though Aliments, and ſome other things taken in, for that they are preſently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the native heat, put off whatever they have of virtue, within ſome few hours, this being then aſſimilated or ſent forth adoors, they ceaſe to operate: yet ſome Medicines being taken inwardly, becauſe they are not eaſily tamed, nor caſt forth of doors preſently, by an irritation ſtirred up, they remain for many days very active, and hold a long time the Juices, and the Blood, in this or that manner of Fermentation, this may be obſerved of ſome Medicines, alſo of Poyſons, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoyſons, the once or twice taking of which, for ſome days, is wont to affect our
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:152521:52"/>
Bodies for a longer time; for 'tis an uſual thing with Cathartic Medicines, when they work little by Vomit, or Stool, to break forth after many weeks outwardly, in Puſtles and Wealks: yea, if Death be avoided, from the drinking of Poyſon, every body knows, that the virulency will lie hid, a long time in the Blood and Juices. In like manner alſo, this powder, and perhaps very many other things inwardly taken, altho they ſeem aſleep, yet continue to act, on the Spirits and Humors.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, altho this Medicine acts immediately on the Blood and Humors, yet it takes not wholly away, the Feaveriſh Dyſcraſie, implanted in them: for, as ſoon as its force is conſumed, and all its Particles are flown away, from the mixture of the Blood, the Diſtemper being only ſuppreſſed for a time, at length riſes up, and repeats its fits after its wonted manner, but foraſmuch as Nature, by the ſpace of this ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becomes ſtronger, therefore, after the Relaps, the fits (not as before) but on the third or fourth day, according to the firſt figure of the Diſeaſe, are wont to return.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It is remarked, that this Remedy, does not ſtop the Feaveriſh acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the ordinary Ague-reſiſters or Febrifuges, by fixing, or alſo by fuſing the Blood; for then the next fit always, and not the ſecond, or third following after, is prevented.</p>
                     <p>According to which poſitions, that we may inſtead of a Corollary, ſubjoin ſome things concerning the manner it ſelf of working, whereby this Medicine ſeems to act; we ſay, it is moſt likely, that when the Particles, proceeding from the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, are throughly mixed with the Blood, they compel it into a certain new Fermentation, by which, whilſt the Particles of the Blood are continually agitated, they are wholly hindered, that they cannot heap up any Excrementitious matter, or enter into Feaveriſh turgeſcencies; for, as after the biting of a mad dog, or ſtinging of any venemous Creatures, the Blood it ſelf, and nervous Juice, are a long while impoyſoned, yet leſt they ſhould conceive preſently great irregularities, Counter-poyſons being taken, do hinder their Liquors, by retaining them in another Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; the uſe of which, if ſo long continued, whilſt the virulent little Bodies are quite flown away, no horrid ſymptom is to be feared, from that evil being contracted; but if the ſtrength of the Remedy, being too ſparingly given, be firſt conſumed, forthwith the Venom repullulates, and the old Poyſon, thought to have been exploded, is at length brought into act: by the ſame way, when the Blood, having gotten a vitious diſpoſition, perverts the Alible Juice, and whereby it might more rightly expel it, heaped together to a fulneſs, conceives Feaveriſh ſwellings up; this Peruvian Bark be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaten, and adminiſtred, by the Commerce of its Particles, ſo agitates the Blood, tho diſtempered with an evil diſpoſition, with a new excited Fermentation, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it, that it in ſome meaſure concocts the nouriſhable Juice, and continually eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porates its Recrements, that they are not heaped together as before, into the matter of a fit: But, when the Particles of this Remedy, are wholly flown away, from the company of the Blood, and the whole virtue conſumed, the evil diſpoſition of the Blood, before contrancted, at length riſes up, and ſo the Feaveriſh fits return, after their wonted manner. Somtimes perhaps it happens, that whilſt the Feaveriſh fits are ſuppreſſed, by the uſe of this powder, by reaſon of the ſeaſon of the year being changed, or by the help of another Remedy, or by the endeavour of Nature it ſelf, that Dyſcraſie of the Blood may be mended, by degrees, and ſo the Feaver may at length vaniſh, of its own accord. This I have known to happen, but very rarely, becauſe almoſt with the ſame certainty, by which you expect the Feaver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh fits to be ſuppreſſed, by that powder, you may afterwards look for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
                     <p>As to what appertains to the ſenſible qualities, with which this Bark is noted, it appears to abound with bitterneſs, and a certain ſtipticity, that it ſeems to the taſt, to have the likeneſs of Savor, which is in moſt Conterpoyſons, as the Root of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Serpentary, Contrayerva, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for what are bitter in act, are ſtrong in excellent virtue, for the ſuppreſſing the force of preternatural Ferments; yea, the Root of Gentian, which is likeſt to this Bark, was in times paſt of famous uſe, for the Curing of Quartan Feavers. But now, altho this Peruvian powder, be the only Alexiterion or Counter-poyſon, as yet found out againſt a Quartan Feaver, to wit, that inhibits (tho only for a time) its fits, and of other Intermitting Feavers, yet it is not to be doubted; but that there are in the world, other Medicines extant, which are as good Ague-reſiſters; and it is hoped, that led by the example of this new invention, we may be excited, to the finding out the virtues of Herbs, almoſt as yet unknown: ſo,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:152521:52"/>
whilſt we ſhall inſiſt on the trial of ſeveral, and the Empirical be joyned to the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Medicine, without doubt the Cures of the Quartan Ague, and of other invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Diſeaſes, may more happily be accompliſhed: which therefore I promiſe more willingly to this Age, or at leaſt to the next, when being led by the Analogy of this Book, I have found out a Medicine, for the profligating of Feavers, of uſe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, it not being long ſince variouſly tryed, which alſo I am wont to give to the poorer ſort, inſtead of ſomthing elſe, with good ſucceſs.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of continual Feavers.</head>
                     <p>A Continual Feaver is that, whoſe fit is continued for many days, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion: It hath its times of remiſſion, and of more fierceneſs, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of intermiſſion; the burning is now more remiſs, now more intenſe, but ſtill the ſick are in a Feaver, until by the temperament, or inſenſible growing well, the Diſeaſe is wholly Cured. Concerning this, it behoves us to inquire, what Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of the Blood it is, which cauſes a continual Feaver; then, by what ways, and from what cauſes, it is wont to be excited: alſo, how it differs from that, which is in Intermitting Feavers. And theſe being performed, we will deſcend to the Species of Continual Feavers.</p>
                     <p>There are many ways, by which the Blood growing hot, induces a continual Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vear, the chief of which may be reduced to theſe Heads: The firſt way is, when the more ſpirituous, and ſubtil Portion of the Blood, becomes too hot, and is diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, with a certain burning, which therefore agitates the other parts of the Blood, and incites it into a certain rage, ſo that the Sulphur, or the Oily part of the Blood; is more diſſolved, and more inkindled in the Heart, alſo, for that cauſe, there is among all the Particles of the Blood, a certain ſyncriſis, contrariety, or perturbation, by which in truth, being confuſed, and put out of order, they are not able quickly to be extricated, and reduced into their former poſture, wherefore, a heat and burning more than is wont to be, is ſtirred up in the whole Body: but when the Spirits are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in fault, their heat and diſorder, are wont within a ſhort ſpace, to be allaied of their own accord, therefore, this Feaver is often terminated within a day, and is rarely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued beyond three: and therefore, is called an Ephemera, or a Feaver of a day, or Synochus of more dayr,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond manner, or degree of growing hot, is when the Sulphureous or Oily part of the Blood, being too much heated, conceives a Fervor: for then, it both grows immoderately hot in the Veſſels, and being very much inkindled in the Heart, produces by its deflagration, a very ſtrong heat in the whole Body. Indeed the Blood, as to its temper, moſtly depends on the condition of the Sulphur; when by reaſon of crudity, the Sulphur is leſs diſſolved, the Blood is made watery and cold, and is moved ſlowly in the Veſſels: but if the Sulphureous, or Oily part of the Blood, grows hot, beyond its Natural diſpoſition, preſently it becomes fierce, and impropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate with the reſt, ſo that, almoſt the whole being acted, as it were into a flame, by the Ferment of the Heart, compels the maſs of Blood to grow immoderately hot, and to boil up. For as when Wines, indued with a rich Lee, are ſtirred up into an heat, by the too rancid Sulphur; or as Hay, laid up too wet, by reaſon of the want of Ventilation, conceives of its own accord a burning, the Particles of the Sulphur being looſned from the mixture; in like manner, when the Blood is not rightly ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated, but being reſtrained from Evacuation, by reaſon of the admixtion of ſome hot thing, or a more plentiful ſanguification, or for ſome other cauſe, the Particles of the Sulphur begin to be thickly gathered together; preſently, all its Liquor, immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately boils up, by the Sulphurs being looſned, and inflamed in the Heart, and this kind of Feaver is induced, which is called a putrid Synochus; notwithſtanding which appellation, tho of many rejected, for that the Blood ſo long as it is in motion, doth not putrifie; yet foraſmuch, as in this Feaver, the mixture of the Blood, is ſomwhat
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:152521:53"/>
looſned, by the Sulphur being too much exalted, and the maſs of its Liquor being changed, from its Natural diſpoſition, tends toward putrefaction, therefore, the term of a putrid Feaver, as hath been anciently uſed, may be ſtill, with good reaſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third degree of growing hot, (and which conſtitutes a diſtinct kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Feaver) is excited, from a certain malignant, and invenomed Ferment, by which, when the maſs of the Blood is imbued, and the Spirits, and the Sulphureous part together, conceive an heat, and their burning is not ſooner appeaſed, than that either that malignant matter be conſumed, and caſt forth of doors, or elſe a certain coagulation, and as it were putrefaction, of the Blood, from its corruptive venom is induced, by which, both circulation is hindered, and the Vital Spirit extinguiſhed. This malignity is wont to ariſe, either from a certain contagion received from without, or from ſome infection begotten within us; according to theſe ways the malignant Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Small-pox, Meaſels, and alſo the Plague, draw their beginnings, and by their contagion, far and near ſet upon many.</p>
                     <p>There are therefore three degrees, or manners of growing hot, by which, the kinds of continual Feavers are determined. From the ſubtil portion of the Blood made hot, or the Ebullition of the Spirits, the Ephemera ariſes, as alſo the Synochus of one or more days: by the Sulphureous, or Oily part of the Blood, being too hot and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled, the putrid Feaver is ſtirred up, then thirdly, upon an invenomed taint, infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Blood, and congealing its Liquor, malignant Feavers depend. In every one of theſe, by the depravation, or rather corruption of the Alible Juice, freſh car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the Blood, the various fits, inequalities, and critical motions ariſe. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I enter upon the ſeveral kinds of a continued Feaver, it is requiſite for me, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how the growing hot of the Blood, in a continual Feaver, differs from that other, which conſtitutes Intermitting Feavers.</p>
                     <p>I ſay therefore, that the growing hot of the Blood, in an Intermitting Feaver, depends only, upon the commixtion of a certain Fermentative matter, and not rightly miſcible, with the Blood, and on its growing up, to a fulneſs of boiling over. Becauſe of this heat, with the Blood in the Veſſels, and of the deflagration in the Heart, the fit is induced; becauſe of its growing cool, the intermiſſion follows, that in the coming between of the fits, neither the Spirits, nor Sulphur, become outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, but the bond of the mixture being kept whole, the Liquor is circulated in the Veſſels, equally, and without trouble: on the contrary, in a continual Feaver, the diſorders of the Spirits, and of Sulphur, of either, or both together, by their proper Ebullition, alſo without the mixture of any other, ſtir up the Ebullition of the Blood; wherefore, there are required, for an intermiſſion, beſides the difflation or cooling of the Excrementitious matter, a deflagration of the inkindled Blood, and a reduction of it to its due Temper.</p>
                     <p>The Conſtitution of the Blood in a continual Feaver, is of the ſame ſort as of Wines, when they grow hot upon too rich a Lee; to wit, are mighty in Spirit, and grow turgid with exalted Sulphur, and therefore they conceive a Fervor, and greatly boil up, of their own accord, without the mixture of any other thing. In an Intermitting Feaver, the Blood is moved after that manner, as Wines, when they conceive an heat, becauſe of ſomthing poured to them, that is not miſcible with them: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, in this Feaver, the diſpoſition of the Blood is of that ſort, as of Wines, when in their decay and declination, they become ropy, unſavory, or acid, to wit, in which the Spirit is depreſſed, that in the mean time, either Salt, or Sulphur, or both together, appear above the reſt, and infect the whole Liquor with their diſorder. An Intermitting Feaver, for the moſt part, is free from danger, becauſe the conſtitutive parts of the Blood, altho they ſhould ſomwhat change their diſpoſition, however, keep the bond of mixture, and whilſt they are in power, are circulated equally in the Veſſels, yea they pervert the nutritious Juice, into a matter, not altogether beſides Nature, but rather infeſting, with its fulneſs and turgeſcency. In a continual Feaver, beſides the intemperance, the mixture of the Blood, and conſtitution of the Liquor, are ſomwhat looſned, and its corruption eaſily follows; wherefore this Diſeaſe often ends in death: further, the nouriſhing Juice is depraved, into a matter wholly viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and altogether infeſtous to Nature.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the Ephemera or Feaver for a Day.</head>
                     <p>I Have ſaid, the leaſt degree of heat, which induces a continual Feaver, is placed in the ſubtil, and Spirituous part of the Blood, being too much agitated and heated; for this, like the Spirit of Wine, boils up on every light occaſion, and conceives a fervor, by a too great motion of the Body, or perturbation of mind, by the ambient heat as of the Sun or vapours, by hot things taken inwardly, as the drinking of Wine, and the eating of peppered meats, and being irritated by ſuch like. For the Spirits of the Blood, eaſily take fire, and being impetuouſly moved, are not preſently appeaſed, but they move throughly other Particles of the Blood, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly confound, and ſnatch them, into a rapid and diſorderly motion; alſo from this motion of the Spirits, the Sulphur, or Oily part of the Blood, is more boiled forth, ſomwhat more diſſolved, and ſomthing more fully inkindled in the Heart, by which means, an intenſe heat is raiſed up, in the whole Body. But foraſmuch, as Sulphur is inkindled, and inflamed only by ſmall parts, and not in the whole, that fervor of the Spirits is quickly appeaſed, and ceaſes: wherefore, the Feaver which is excited by this means, for the moſt part is terminated, within twenty four hours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is called an Ephemera, or a Feaver of a day. If that by reaſon of a greater heat of the Spirituous Blood, it is prolonged further, it rarely exceeds three days, and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an Ephemera of more days, or a Synochus not putrid: but if it ſhould happen to be lengthned beyond this time, this Feaver eaſily paſſes into a putrid, <hi>viz.</hi> from the dayly Ebullition of the Spirituous Blood, the more thick Particles of the Sulphur, at length begin to take fire, and involve the whole maſs of Blood, in its Efferveſcency: even as the Spirit of Turpentine, being ſhut up in a Cucurbit, and being put into a Sand Furnace, if it be forced with a moderate heat, boils up gently, as the Blood in a Feaver of a day; but if the heat be made more ſtrong; the Liquor grows im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuouſly hot, till it breaks forth into a flame, to which the inflamation of the Blood, in a putrid Feaver, may be very aptly compared.</p>
                     <p>The Days Feaver, and Synochus ſimple, rarely begin without an evident cauſe: Beſides what hath been but now ſaid, immoderate Labour, Watchings, a ſudden paſſion of the mind, a conſtriction of the pores, a Surfeit, alſo a Bubo or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed Sore, a Wound, the coming down of the Milk in Child-bearing Women, are wont to induce them: The procatartic Cauſes, which diſpoſe to this, are an hot temper of Body, an active habit, a ſedentary life, and difuſe of exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>The chief beginnings of this Diſeaſe, depend upon the preſence of the evident cauſe: for either, little Bodies of extraneous heat, being confuſed with the Blood, like water boiling over the fire, make it to boil up; or this Feaver is induced, by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by reaſon of tranſpiration being ſtopped; even as Wines made hot by moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or when too cloſely ſtopped in the Ton, are put into a Fervor: but what way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever an inflamation is firſt excited, preſently the Spirits become enraged, and being moved hither and thither, compel the Blood to boil up, and to be inlarged into a greater ſpace, with a ſpumous rarefaction: wherefore, the Veſſels are diſtended, and the membranous parts hauled, hence follow pain, chiefly in the Head and Loins, a ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous wearineſs, and as it were an inflation of the whole Body. If that, with the Spirit of the Blood, a certain Sulphureous part, be alſo in ſome meaſure inkindled, a ſharp heat is diffuſed through the whole, the Pulſe is vehement and quick, the Urine red, alſo thirſt, watchings, and many other ſymptoms infeſt, the reaſons of which are added hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Solution, or Criſis of the Ephemeran Feaver, and of the not putrid Synochus, three things are chiefly requiſite: <hi>viz.</hi> a removing of the evident cauſe, ſecondly a ſeparation, and a ſcattering of the depraved, or excrementitious matter, from the maſs of Blood: Thirdly, a quieting of the parts of the Blood, and a reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, to their natural and equal motion and ſite. According as theſe ſucceed, now more ſuddenly, now more ſlowly, and difficully, this Diſeaſe is finiſhed in a ſhorter, or longer time.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="92" facs="tcp:152521:54"/>1. The evident cauſe, which for the moſt part is extrinſick, is eaſily removed, and the ſick are wont, preſently to avoid the preſence, or aſſiduity of that thing, and do perceive a ſenſe of any thing that is hurtful; none taking a Feaver from Wine, will ſtill indulge the drinking of it, as ſoon as any one grows more than uſually hot, in a Bath, or the heat of the Sun, 'tis a trouble to them to ſtay longer.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As to the Excrementitious matter, which ought to be ſcattered, and ſeparated from the Blood: this is either brought from without, as when the Blood is infected by ſurfeit, drinking of Wine, ſitting in the Sun, or from a too hot Bath, with <hi>Effluvia,</hi> or little dry, and Fermentative Bodies; or this matter is begotten within, as when its Liquor is ſtuffed with recrements, or aduſt Particles, from the deflagration of the Blood. Either of theſe matters, ought to be ſeparated from the Blood, to be diſperſed, and either by ſweat, or inſenſible breathing forth, to be thruſt out of doors, before the Feaver be appeaſed; wherefore, when as the pores are bound up, and tranſpiration hindred, the Ephemeran Feaver is longer protracted, and ſomtimes paſſes, from a ſimple Synochus, into a putrid.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The evident cauſe being removed, and this degenerate matter diſperſed, there is required for the remiſſion, a quieting, and reducing into order, the parts of the Blood; for diverſe Particles of the Blood, being after this manner confuſed; and by reaſon of the Feaveriſh heat, carried up and down, they do not preſently get again the former order of ſituation and poſition; but it is needful, that they be by degrees extricated, and by little and little reſtored, to a juſt mixture.</p>
                     <p>Although this Diſeaſe, after the removing of the evident cauſe, for the moſt part ceaſes of its own accord, within a while, yet ſome Medicinal Remedies may be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, with good ſucceſs, eſpecially, when there is danger, leſt the Ephemeran Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſhould paſs into a putrid, The chief intentions ſhould be, to ſuppreſs the fervor of the Blood, and to procure a more free tranſpiration; to the which conduce, firſt a breathing of a Vein, a ſlender diet, or rather abſtinency, cooling drinks, and a bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the filth of the Belly, by Clyſters: Sleep, and Reſt, greatly help, above all the reſt; which, if wanting ſhould be procured in time, by Opiats, and Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynes.</p>
                     <p>Verily, altho the Hiſtories, and Obſervations of thoſe, diſtempered with an Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meran Feaver, contain in themſelves nothing very rare; yet I ſhall ſubjoin an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or two, in this place, whereby the delineation or type of this Diſeaſe, may be illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
                     <p>A certain young Gentleman, about twenty years of Age, endued with a ſtrong ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Body, by the immoderate drinking of ſtrong Wine, fell into a Feaveriſh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, with thirſt, heat, and with a great burning of his Precordia; being let Blood, he drank a great quantity of fair water, and upon it preſently a plentiful ſweat following, he grew ſhortly well: In this caſe, the more thin portion of the Blood, being heated by the Spirits of the Wine, fell into a rage, cauſed the whole maſs of Blood to be ſhaken, and its frame to be looſned, more than twas wont; and for that reaſon, that hapned to be more diſſolved, by the Ferment of the Heart, and to be as it were inkindled by the active Particles, looſned from the mixture; until the Veſſels being emptied by Phlebotomy, the raging Blood was cooled, and by the drinking of the water, its fervor was attempered; then the hot <hi>Effluvia,</hi> being involved, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the aduſt matter, with a copious <hi>Serum,</hi> and ſent away by Sweat, the Blood at length recovered its due temper. Moreover, an ingenious young man, of a ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary life, and alſo very much addicted to the Study of Learning, when he had for ſomtime exerciſed himſelf, beyond his ſtrength, in the hot Sunſhine, he began to complain of the pain of his head, a want of Appetite, a heat of his Precordia, and of a Feaveriſh diſtemper all over; to whom, (for that he was wholly averſe to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick) I ordered an abſtinence from all things whatſoever, unleſs from Small-Beer, and Grewel; on the ſecond day, and ſo more on the third, the ſymptoms remitted, by little and little, on the fourth, he went home freed from the Feaver, without any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of a Putrid Feaver.</head>
                     <p>SO much for a Continual Feaver, which is raiſed from the moſt ſimple heating of the Blood, or its loweſt degree of inordinate heat; that which depends on a greater degree of heat follows, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Oily or Sulphureous part of the Blood, being too much heated, ſwells up above meaſure, and as it were forced into a flame; and therefore from the ſimilitude, by which humid things putrifying, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an heat, this kind of Ebullition of the Blood, becauſe it induces an immoderate heat, is called a putrid Feaver: which name ought to be retained without injury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in this Feaver, the Syntheſis of the Blood, (as is wont to happen in putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Liquors) is very much unlocked. When the Spirits only grow inraged, (as in an Ephemera) the frame of the Blood is ſomwhat ſet open, and looſened, that it is more diſſolved, by the Ferment of the Heart, than is wont, and more Particles than na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally uſe to do, leap forth, and diffuſe a more intenſe heat; but yet the mixture of the Liquor, as to its chief parts, is conſerved. But when the Sulphureous matter taking fire, grows hot above meaſure, the bond of the mixture, for the greateſt part, is looſed, that its Principles are almoſt wholly drawn away, by the Ferment of the Heart, and the active Particles, being looſned from the mixture, break forth as it were into a flame. Wherefore, the Liquor of the Blood being after this manner rarified, in the Heart, and as it were inkindled, is from thence carried, through the Veſſels, with a moſt rapid motion, and diſperſes very many <hi>Effluvia</hi> of heat, from its deflagration. Hence, the whole maſs of Blood, (like water put over the fire) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually boiling, diſtends the Veſſels, pulls the Brain and Nervous parts, raiſes up Convulſions, and pains in them, very much deſtroys the Vital Spirits with its heat, waſts the Ferments of the Bowels, hinders the Offices of concoction, and diſpenſation, often depraves the nouriſhing Juice, deſtinated for the Nervous ſtock, that from thence exceeding great diſorders of the Animal Spirits follow; yea almoſt perverts the whole oeconomy of Nature.</p>
                     <p>The courſe of this Diſeaſe ſhews it ſelf after this manner; It rarely begins without a procatartic cauſe, or previous diſpoſition: to wit, the Sulphureous or oily part of the Blood, is firſt too much carried forth, and exalted beyond its due tenor, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, either of its own accord, (like Hay not eventilated) begins to grow hot, or by the coming of an evident cauſe, it is forced into a preternatural heat. But when it grows turgid in the firſt place, by reaſon of the admixtion of a crude Juice with the Blood, now a ſhivering, now heat infeſts, which ſhew themſelves unequally, like fire, which is covered with green wood, ſends forth now ſmoak, now flame: But at length, the fire glowing more largely, as here the victor fire ſpreads it ſelf abroad, ſo there (ſooner than ſaid) the whole maſs of Blood is inflamed, and is urged at once with heat, and a moſt ſwift motion: Nor is this immoderate heat of the Blood appeaſed, before its active particles being looſned from the mixture, and then ſucceſſively in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled in the Heart, are wholly burned out, which doth not happen, but in the ſpace of many days. And then at length this Feaver ceaſes, when the remaining Liquor of the Blood, the Spirit and Sulphur being very much conſumed, being made lifeleſs and poor, is fit only for a weak and ſmall fermentation. From this kind of deflagration of the Blood, and alſo of the alible Juice, (by the ſame fire burnt out) the recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or little Bodies of torrified matter, are heaped up in the Blood; which yet do more promote its fervor, and ebullition, and for a time, increaſe the Feaveriſh diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. After the Blood hath very much burned forth, and theſe kind of little Bodies, are gathered together to a fulneſs of ſwelling up, the vital Spirit endeavors a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and tries to concoct, and to overcome, (what it may) theſe aduſt recrements, and then, having put a great many of them into a ſwelling up, a Flux being riſen, ſtrives to ſhut them wholly out. And indeed, in the ſubaction, and ſecluſion of this matter, chiefly conſiſts the event of this Diſeaſe; for if the vital Spirit being ſtrong, the Bloody humor (when it hath ſufficiently burned forth, and ſhall be freed from
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:152521:55"/>
theſe aduſt particles) ſhould recover its priſtine tenor, whereby it is made fit for moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a due fermentation in the Heart, the ſick tends towards health; but if, by a long deflagration, and an inextricable confuſion of the morbific matter, the liquor of the Blood, being wanting of Spirits, and more pure Sulphur, or thoſe ſame (by the impure mixture growing ill) being as it were put under the yoak; is rendred ſo life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, that it is not any longer rarified, by the ferment of the Heart, or inkindled; by degrees, its heat, and motion, together with Life it ſelf decays.</p>
                     <p>The procatartick cauſes, which diſpoſe to this Diſeaſe, are, an hot and humid Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, an active habit of Body, a youthful Age, the Spring time, or Summer ſeaſon, a high and rich Dyet, beſides the often drinking of rich Wines, a ſedent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ry and idle life, a Body full of groſs humors, and ſtuffed with vitious Juices; but above all the reſt, it appears by obſervation, that the frequent letting of Blood, renders men more apt to Feavers; wherefore it is commonly ſaid, from whom Blood is once drawn, that unleſs they do the ſame every year, they are prone to a Feaver. The reaſon of this is, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I am deceiv'd) by the frequent letting of Blood, the Sulphur is more copiouſly gathered together, in the maſs of Blood; in the mean time, the Salt (which ſhould bridle it, and hinder it from raging) by this means is drawn away; for the Blood, the older it grows, becomes ſo much the more Salt, the Salt of all the Elements not eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating. But by how much the more the Blood abounds in Salt, by ſo much the leſs it abounds in Sulphur; for Salt eats and conſumes the Sulphur, and makes it evaporate: wherefore, they who are lean, and abound with a Salt Blood, are leſs prone to Feavers. But when, by the letting of Blood, the ancient Blood is drawn forth, in its ſtead another more rich, and more impregnated with Sulphur, is ſubſtituted; ſo that it becomes leſs Salt, and more Sulphurous. Hence it is, that thoſe who often let Blood, are not only prone to Feavers, but alſo are wont to grow fat, becauſe of the Bloods being more impregnated with Sulphureous Juice.</p>
                     <p>The evident cauſes, which deduce the latent diſpoſition of this Feaver into act, are of the ſame ſort, which procure an Ephemeran Feaver, and ſimple Synochus; in this rank chiefly come, Tranſpiration being hindred, and Surfeiting. By reaſon of the <hi>effluvia</hi> being reſtrained, the maſs of the Blood being increaſed in bulk grows turgid, and conceives a Fervor, as it were from a certain ferment, inſpired anew, and cruelly boyls up; from thence, preſently the pores are more obſtructed, by the infartion of the <hi>effluvia,</hi> and the frame of the Liquor being looſned, the particles of the Sulphur, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uberating in the Blood, leap forth from the mixture, and are inflamed by the ferment of the heart, as it were by fire put to them, and ſo they enkindle a very intenſe Feaver. But from a Surfeit, both an immoderate fermentation is induced in the Blood, and alſo a nitrous Sulphureous matter, apt for aduſtion, and an inkindling is conveyed, as it were food, to the burning Blood.</p>
                     <p>In this Feaver, four times or ſeaſons are to be obſerved, in which, as it were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poſts, or ſpaces, its courſe is performed: Theſe are then, The Beginning, the Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, the Height, and Declination. Theſe are wont to be finiſhed in ſome ſooner, in others more ſlowly, or in a longer time. The beginning ought to be computed, from the time the Blood begins to be made hot, and its Sulphur to conceive a burning, untill the ardors, and burnings are diffuſed, thorow the whole maſs of Blood. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or Augmentation, is from the time, that the Blood being made hot, and inkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thorow the whole, burns forth for ſome time, and its maſs is aggravated with the Recrements, or burnt Particles, which increaſe the fermentation. The ſtate, or ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Diſeaſe, is when (after the Blood has ſufficiently burned forth, and its burning now remits) the long vexed Blood, like a noble wreſtler, when his adverſary is a little yielding, recollecting all his ſtrength, endeavours a bringing under, and a ſeparation of that aduſt matter, with which it is filled to a plenitude, and alſo, a Criſis or ſeparation being once or oftner attempted, an expulſion of it forth of doors. The Declination ſucceeds after the Criſis or ſecretion, in which the Blood grows leſs hot, with a languiſhing fire, and either, (the vital Spirit being as yet ſtrong) overcomes what is left of that aduſt and extraneous matter, and by degrees puts it forth, until it is reſtored to its former vigour; or, whilſt the ſame Spirit is too much depreſſed, the liquor of the Blood, is ſtill ſtuffed with aduſt recrements, and therefore becomes troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and depauperated, that it neither aſſimilates the nouriſhing Juice, nor is made fit for an accenſion in the heart, for the ſuſtaining the lamp of Life.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When therefore any one is taken with a putrid Feaver, the firſt aſſault is for the moſt part accompanied with a ſhivering or horror: for when the Blood begins to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:152521:55"/>
grow hot, there is a flux made, and a ſwelling up of the crude Juice, freſhly gathered together in the Veſſels, even as in the fit of an intermitting Feaver, heat, and ſomtimes ſweat follow, upon the ſhivering, by which, the matter of that crude Juice is inkindled, and diſperſed: afterwards, a certain remiſſion of the heat follows, but yet from the fire ſtill glowing in the Blood, a laſſitude, and perturbation with thirſt, and waking, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually infeſt: A pain ariſes in the Head, or Loins, partly from the ebullition of the Blood, and partly from the motion of the nervous Juice being hindred; alſo a nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or a vomiting offends the Stomach, becauſe the Bile, flowing out of the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leduct Veſſels, is poured into it, and a Convulſion from Vapors, and from the ſharp Juice brought thorow the Arteries, is excited in the Stomach. In the mean time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho the heat be more increaſed, and inequal, it is not yet ſtrong, becauſe the Blood as yet abounding with crude Juices, is only inkindled by parts: and therefore burns out a little, and then ceaſes, and at laſt returns; like a flame that is made by wet, and moiſt ſtraw. In this condition for ſome days, the Diſeaſe remains, the Urine is more red than uſual, by reaſon of the Salt, and Sulphur being more diſſolved, and infected with the <hi>ſerum;</hi> It ſtill retains its Hypoſtaſis or ſubſtance, becauſe the Coction and aſſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not altogether depraved; it appears greater than ordinary, in its ſediment, which is yet eaſily ſeparated, and falls to the bottom of its own accord. At this time, they may let Blood, and adminiſter Phyſick by Vomit, or Purge, ſo it be done without any great perturbation of the Blood: it often happens, from theſe kinds of evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, timely performed, that a greater increaſe of the Diſeaſe is prevented, and the Feaver as it were killed in the ſhell. The limits of this ſtadium or ſpace, are variouſly determined, according to the temper of the ſick, and other accidents of the Diſeaſe; ſomtimes, the firſt rudiments of this Feaver, are laid in a day or two; ſomtimes the beginning of the Diſeaſe is extended to more; if in a corpulent Body full of Spirit, Juice, and hot Blood, or it happen in a youthful Age, and very hot ſeaſon, if the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to a Feaver be potent, and the evident cauſe coming thereupon be ſtrong, the Feaveriſh heat, being once begun, quickly invades all the Blood, and on the ſecond or third day, having rooted it ſelf, the Diſeaſe ariſes to its increaſe; but if the Feaveriſh indiſpoſition, be begun in a leſs hot Body, a Phlegmatic temper, or a melancholy, and in old age, or a cold ſeaſon, the entrance is longer, and ſcarce exceeds the limits of this firſt ſtadium or ſpace, before the ſixth, or ſeventh day.</p>

The increaſe of this Diſeaſe, is computed from what time, the burning of the Feaver hath poſſeſt the whole maſs of Blood: that is, the Sulphur, or the oily part of the Blood, having been long heated, and growing fervent in parts, at length, like Hay laid up wet, breaks forth, after a long heating, all at once into a flame; the Blood at this time cruelly boils up, and very much inkindled in the Heart, by its deflagration, diffuſes as it were a fiery heat thorow the whole Body, and eſpecially in the precordia; hence the ſick complain of intolerable thirſt, beſides a pain of the head, pertinacious wakings, and oftentimes a delirium, Phrenſie, and Convulſive motions infeſt: all food whatſoever is loathſom, either it is caſt up again by Vomit, or if retained, being baked by too much heat, it goes into a Feaveriſh matter; beſides, there happens a bitterneſs of the mouth, an ingrateful ſavor, a ſcurfineſs of the Tongue, a vehement and quick Pulſe, an Urine highly red, and for the moſt part troubled, full of Contents, without Hypoſtaſis or laudable ſediment; when the Blood is at this time almoſt wholly inkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by its deflagration, it begets great plenty of aduſt matter, (as it were aſhes remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after a Fire) with which the <hi>ſerum</hi> being very much ſtuffed, renders the Urine thick, and big with Contents: Alſo the Blood, being filled with a load of this, to a riſing up, is irritated into Critical motions, by which this Feaveriſh matter, (if it may be done) being brought under, and ſeparated, is ſhut out of doors; and indeed, this ſtate of the Feaver induces that, in which a Judgment is diſcerned, between Nature and the Diſeaſe, the ſtrife being as it were brought to an aequilibrium; and therefore the evacuation, which follows from thence, is called the Criſis.</p>
                     <p>The ſtate therefore, or height of a putrid Feaver, is that time of the Diſeaſe, in which Nature endeavors a Criſis, or an expulſion of the aduſt matter, remaining after the deflagration of the Blood. To this is required, in the firſt place, that the Blood hath now for the moſt part burned forth; becauſe in the midſt of its burning, Nature is not at leiſure for a Criſis, nor is it ever proſperouſly endeavored, nor in truth procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Art with good Succeſs. Secondly, that the ſpirit of the Blood, doth firſt, by ſome means ſubdue this aduſt matter, or <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> ſeparate it from the profitable, and render a period to the expulſion, for otherways, tho a copious evacuation happens,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:152521:56"/>
Nature will never be free from her burthen. Thirdly, that this matter, be gathered together in ſuch a quantity, that by its turgency, it may irritate Nature to a Critical expulſion. If theſe rightly concur, a perfect Criſis of the Diſeaſe, for the moſt part ſucceeds, in which, even as in the Fits of intermitting Feavers, a Flux being ariſen, whatſoever extraneous and heterogeneous thing, is contained in the boſom of the Blood, is exagitated, then being ſeparated, and involved with <hi>ſerum,</hi> it is thruſt forth of doors; when any thing of theſe is wanting, the Criſis, for the moſt part, is in vain, and not to be truſted, and rarely cures the Diſeaſe. For if in the midſt of the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before the Blood hath ſufficiently burned forth, an evacuation happens, by Sweat, a Lask, Bleeding, or any other way, the aduſt matter is not all ſeparated, or elſe, if for the preſent, it be drawn away for the greateſt part, the Blood more largely flaming out, preſently ſubſtitutes new, and will renew the Feaver again, that ſeemed to be vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: If that this matter, not being yet overcome, nor brought to a fulneſs of riſing up, be irritated to an expulſion by Nature, an imperfect, and partial Criſis only follows; and when the firſt indeavor of excretion ſhall be in vain, rarely a perfect, and curatory ſucceeds after that one time.</p>
                     <p>The Criſis in a continual Feaver, is almoſt the ſame thing, as the Fit of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Feavers. For as in this, when the maſs of Blood, is filled to a fulneſs of ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up, with the particles of depraved alible Juice, and fitted for maturation, there are made a Flux, ſecretion, and expulſion out of doors of that matter: ſo in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Feaver, from the deflagration of the Blood, and alible Juice, very many little Bodies of aduſt matter are gathered together, with which, when the Blood is aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and is at leaſure, a little from the burning, it overcomes them, by little and little ſeparates them, and then a Flux being raiſed up, endeavors to caſt them out of doors: wherefore, as the Fits of intermitting Feavers come not but at a ſet time, and after ſo many hours, ſo alſo the Critical motions, happen from the fourth day to the fourth, or perhaps from the ſeventh day to the ſeventh, for in this kind of ſpace, the Blood being inkindled burns forth, and with its burning makes an heap of aduſt matter, as it were aſhes, which being troubleſom to Nature by their irritation, induces Critical mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, what ſome affirm is not true, That the Criſes depend altogether on the influences of the Moon, and Stars, and follow their Aſpects, Quadrations, Oppoſitions, or Conjunctions: becauſe the Critical evacuations are only determined, by the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together, and the ſwelling up, of the aduſt matter. For, as ſoon as the Blood is at leaſure, from the deflagration, and being filled with the particle of that aduſt matter, is able in ſome meaſure to overcome, and ſeparate them, preſently a Flux, or ſwelling up being riſen, it endeavors to thruſt them forth by any way; which, for that they are eaſily to be ſeparated from the Blood, and the breathing places of the skin are ſufficiently open, being involved with <hi>ſerum,</hi> are ſent away with ſweat. And this is the beſt way of the Criſis, which if it rightly ſucceeds, very often, wholly, and at one time, perfectly cures the Diſeaſe without danger of relapſe: To this next, follows the Criſis, which which is endeavored by the Hemorrhage or bleeding at noſe; for this matter, as it were the flowring, being moved with the Blood, (if it be not caſt forth by ſweat, by reaſon of a leſs free tranſpiration) is transferred from the heart, into ſome remote part, and frequently is caſt into the head, by the impetuous rapture of the Blood; where, if a paſſage be open, from the private holes opening into the noſtrils, the morbific matter, leaps forth of doors, with a portion of the Blood. But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways being oftentimes fixed in the Brain, brings a phrenſie, delirium, or other grievous, and tedious Diſeaſes of the head; yea, tis to be obſerved, that almoſt in all continual Feavers whatſoever, when they are hardly or imperfectly cured, ſo that the Blood is infected, for a long time with the Feaveriſh matter or aduſt recrements, that from thence, the nervous Juice (as it ſeems) contracting an infection, pertinacious diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, to wit, watchings, alſo Deliriums, Tremblings, Convulſive motions, and long ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering weakneſs of the nervous parts follow. Alſo, there are other ways of Criſis, by which Nature endeavors, not at once and wholly, but by little and little, and by parts, to expel the Feaveriſh matter; now by Urine, now by Vomit, or Stool, now by breakings forth, and buboes, or biles; by what way ſoever, that it may be done with a good event, it is required, that the deflagration of the Blood be paſt, and that the aduſt matter be concocted, and rendered fit to be ſeparated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:152521:56"/>The ſtate or ſtanding of the Diſeaſe, is therefore not one, and ſimple, nor always happens after the ſame manner, but with a various difference of ſymptoms, and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to far different events. But by a prudent Phyſician, a Prognoſtication is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to be given, in what ſpace of time, the Diſeaſe will come to its height or ſtanding, and what end it will have.</p>
                     <p>If the Feaver be vehement from the beginning, and ſuddenly invades the whole maſs of Blood with a burning; if it urges conſtantly, and equally without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, with a ferocity of ſymptoms; for the moſt part, the Blood will ſo much burn forth, in the ſpace of four days, that the aduſt matter, will ariſe to a fulneſs of ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up, for the making a Criſis. But if its beginnings are more ſlow, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of the Blood often interrupted, the Feaver will come to its <hi>acme</hi> or height, about the ſeventh day. If it ſhould begin yet more remiſs, the ſtanding of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is wont to be drawn out, to the Eleventh or Fourteenth day. In the mean time it is to be noted, that as the Fits of intermitting Feavers return at ſet times, ſo the Critical motions in continual Feavers, (but for the moſt part they obſerve the fourth day:) for altho the Criſis may be perfectly prorogued to the fourteenth, ſeventeenth, or perhaps the twentieth day, becauſe all things, requiſite to the full curing of the Diſeaſe, do not ſooner concur; yet in the time betwixt, more light motions happen, by which the Feaveriſh matter ariſing leiſurely, to an increaſe, is a little emptied, and as it were cut off by parts, until Nature may be able to enter upon its more full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion; but when the great proviſion of the aduſt matter, in the burning Blood, is heaped up in the Veſſels, Nature, unleſs otherways diſturbed, on every fourth day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tyred with the plenty of matter, trys to ſhake off part of its burthen by a certain ſwelling up: wherefore, for the moſt part, the Critical motions happen on the fourth, ſeventh, eleventh, and fourteenth days, not by the direction of the Planets, but by reaſon of the neceſſity of Nature.</p>
                     <p>As to the event, whether the Criſis ſhall be good or not, certain foreknowledges are taken, from the ſtrength of the ſick, the Pulſe, Urine, and other ſigns, and concourſe of ſymptoms: If the ſick appear with ſome ſtrength, the fire of the Feaver urging, hath a ſtrong and equal Pulſe, if the Urine be of a moderate conſiſtency with ſome ſediment, with a ſeparation of the Contents, and eaſily falling to the bottom, if the Diſeaſe ſhall make its progreſs, without great Vomiting, Watchings, Phrenſie, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive motions, and ſuſpition of malignity, the ſtanding will be laudable, and to be expected with a good Criſis: if the contrary to theſe happen, <hi>viz.</hi> that preſently ſtrength is caſt down, and that the ſick is obnoxious to frequent Swoonings, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, a delirium, with a weak intermitting or unequal Pulſe, if pertinacious watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, intollerable thirſt, and Vomiting continually infeſt; if the Urine be thick and troubled, without ſediment, or ſinking down of the parts, if, the burning yet troubling, Nature is provoked to critical evacuations, a very dangerous ſtate of the Diſeaſe is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, nor may there be hoped for any thing of good from the Criſis.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Criſis of a Putrid Feaver, we will here ſubjoyn a particular Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtication, in which, though the things, which from the beginning did appear, might promiſe a moſt deſired event, a very deadly one is imminent; I have often obſerved, in a Putrid Feaver, which begins ſlowly, and with a ſmall burning, if the Urine be red, and when rendred preſently troubled, and thick, which is not precipitated, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the cold, nor of its own accord, puts down a ſediment, and if at the ſame time, the ſick lie for many days without ſleep, tho quiet, and that they toſs not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up and down, their condition is in danger: and the ſuſpition will be more, if in the mean time, they are neither troubled with a ſtrong Feaver, nor infeſted with thirſt, or with a very troubleſom heat; becauſe thoſe diſtempered after this manner, are incident for the moſt part, about the ſtate of the Diſeaſe, to a delirium, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive motions, and oftentimes fall into madneſs, from which they are quickly caſt into death; and when theſe ſymptoms ariſe, the Urine is altered, from a thick and red, into a thin and more pale Urine. It ſeems in this caſe, the maſs of Blood, beink taken with the Feaver, not to grow turgid, ſo with Sulphur exalted to the height, as Wines or Beer are wont in their Efferveſcencies; but (the Salt, and the terreſtrial Lee or Dregs, being ſtirred together with the Sulphur) to be affected after the ſame way, as Wines and Beer, being ſuddenly diſturbed with Thunder, and growing ſour; wherefore, altho the Blood does not preſently conceive an immoderate heat from the Feaver, yet its diſpoſition being changed, it wholly depraves the Juice deſtinated to the Brain, and Nervous parts, and therefore, about the beginning of the Feaver, pertinacious watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:152521:57"/>
happen, then the ſtate growing urgent, the oeconomy of the whole Nervous ſtock is perverted. Melancholic perſons are moſt obnoxious to theſe ſort of Feavers, in whom the unrulineſs of the Sulphur, are a little reſtrained, by the Salt, and Earthy dregs being ſtirred up with it, notwithſtanding which, all being leiſurely carried forth, break forth afterwards, with a greater ſlaughter.</p>
                     <p>When the Diſeaſe ſhall come to the ſtanding, either the buſineſs is done at one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, and from thence with a manifeſt declination, there is made a tranſlation to life, or death, or there are made frequent skirmiſhes, between Nature and the Diſeaſe, and critical motions are often attempted, before the victory is yielded to either party.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, If after the Blood hath ſufficiently burned forth, with a good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion of ſigns and ſymptoms, and its burning hath remitted, the aduſt matter being equally brought under, and ſubtilated, ariſes from a full increaſe, to the motion of boiling up; and Nature being free from any impediment or depreſſion, is ſtrong with able ſtrength enough, for the decertation or ſtrife, the Feaveriſh matter, for the moſt part, is exterminated at one motion of its flowring or putting forth, and the Blood being freed from its fellowſhip and infection, ſoon recovers its former vigour.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But if Nature is ſtirred up, to a critical motion, before the Blood hath perfectly burnt forth, or that aduſt matter is prepared for excretion, altho, as to the reſt, things are in a moderate condition; yet from hence, but an imperfect Criſis follows, by which indeed, ſomthing of the load or burthen, with which the Blood is oppreſſed, is drawn away; notwithſtanding preſently another ſprings up afreſh, in its place, and then at ſet times, (perhaps in four, or ſeven days ſpace) like the fits of intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the critical motions are repeated, the ſecond, and perhaps the third time, before the ſtrife being ended, the matter openly inclines to this, or that party.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But when, with the preceeding evil appearance, of ſigns and ſymptoms, the burning of the Blood yet urging, the critical motion is provoked, without any coction of the Feaveriſh matter, ſomtimes Nature is overthrown at the firſt conflict, nor doth ſhe recollect herſelf, but yielding her powers overcome by the Diſeaſe, is precipitated into death. Nor is the buſineſs much better, when the Criſis is at firſt imperfect, and in vain, celebrated, without any eaſe to the ſick, and from thence, the next to this ſucceeds worſe, and then in another, and perhaps another conflict, the Diſeaſe prevails, until the ſtrength being wholly broken, and caſt down, there is a plain end of life.</p>
                     <p>Thus much concerning the ſtate and Criſis of the Diſeaſe, on whoſe good or improſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſucceſs, the event of the Diſeaſe depends; the declination of the Feaver, takes its period of this, of which we muſt ſpeak next.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Altho the Declining of the Feaver, for the moſt part, is taken in the better part, that it denotes the condition of the ſick growing well of the Diſeaſe, in which the Blood being almoſt freed from its Effervency, recovers leiſurly, ſtrength and ſpirits, that were loſt, and expels what extraneous thing is left remaining in its boſom; yet, in a genuine enough ſignification, it may be uſed for that ſtate, when from an ill Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, or in vain, the Blood being depauperated, and infected with an extraneous and Feaveriſh mixture, ſtill declines for the worſe, until at length (like Wine changed into a lifeleſſneſs) being made wholly unable for circulation, and accenſion in the Heart, it calls on death. Therefore, in this place, the name of declination ſignifies the condition of the ſick, and of the Diſeaſe, which follows the ſtanding, whether it tends to life, or to death; whether the Feaver, or life it ſelf of the ſick, at this time, declines.</p>
                     <p>As to the times of declination, it will be worth our labour to inquire, what the temper of the Blood may be, and what turns of alterations it has undergone, as often as from a good, or bad Criſis, there has been made a progreſs of the Diſeaſe, towards Health, or Death. To wit, firſt, what the diſpoſition, or condition of the Blood and Spirits may be, from a good Criſis, and with what alterations, its ſpoiled Liquor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers its former vigor. Secondly, what their temper is, from an evil Criſis, and by what degrees it ſtill tends to worſe; and laſtly, how they are, when from a doubtful ſtate, and long weakneſs, the ſick hardly get up at length, and recover their health.</p>
                     <p>The vice, or depauperation, which the Blood hath contracted from the Feaveriſh heat, conſiſts in this: The Spirit very much evaporates, and is loſt: the Sulphureous part is too much ſcorched, and is much waſted by the deflagration, and from its bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the aduſt matter (as it were the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi>) is left, with the Particles of which, the maſs of Blood is aggravated, and debilitated; in the mean time, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line and earthy parts, are too much exalted, even as is wont to come to paſs in Wine, or Beer, by the uſe of too much Ferment. The Blood, by theſe ways being ſpoiled,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:152521:57"/>
evilly aſſimilates the proviſion of the Nutritious Juice, yea alſo, by reaſon of the roaſting of the Sulphur in the Heart, or defect of it, not rightly Fermenting, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, it untowardly diſpenſes the Vital Spirit, in the mean time, from the aduſt matter, and Salt too much exalted, it grows more fervent than it ſhould, and more waſts it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From a good Criſis, the Spirit, tho made weaker, yet gets the upper hand, wherefore, what is left of the Feaveriſh matter, it by degrees overcomes, and expels, and concocts, and aſſimilates (ſo what is brought be thin or ſlender) the Nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Juice: from thence, the maſs of Blood is amended anew, with Spirit and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur; and the Blood which now being Salt and ſharp, did continually grow hot, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires at length a Sweet and Balſamic Nature, and being quickned with a lively mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and heat, rightly performs the offices of life and ſenſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From a bad Criſis, the buſineſs is otherways, the Liquor of the Blood (like Wine too much Fermented) degenerates, almoſt into a vappidneſs or lifeleſſneſs; its Spirit is greatly deminiſhed; the Reliques which remain, are intricated, and as it were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, with the Particles of aduſt matter, from whence there is yet a continual growing hot remaining in the Blood, yet without concoction, or aſſimilation, of the Alible Juice, or ſeparation of the profitable, from the unprofitable: The benign Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and the Food of the Vital flame, is much conſumed, ſo that the Blood is leſs inkindled in the Heart, than it ought to be; in the mean time; from the aduſt recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and alſo the Salt, and Earth being too much carried forth, it perpetually burns in the Veſſels, with thirſt and heat. And becauſe it is dayly depauperated, the Spirit and benign Sulphur being waſted, and more infected, with the Salt, and Earthy dregs being too much exalted, its Liquor in a ſhort time becomes taſtleſs, and is made unfit for circulation, and for the inkindling in the Heart, for the ſuſtaining the Vital fire: wherefore there is a neceſſity that life be loſt, even as the flame of a Lamp is extinguiſhed, when inſtead of the waſted Oil, a Salt and Muddy Liquor only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From an imperfect and doubtful Criſis, when the ſick being weakned by a long imbecillity, become not well, but of a long time, the buſineſs is after this manner. The Spirituous and Sulphureous parts of the Blood, are very much conſumed, by the ſlow deflagration; the remaining Liquor, being not Purged from the aduſt recrements and feculencies, is rendred very impure; but when there is yet remaining, ſomthing of Oil for the Vital Lamp, nor Spirits are altogether wanting, for the ſubduing the Feaveriſh matter, the Blood is ſtill circulated, and (tho but ſmally) is inkindled in the Heart: yea, and by little and little the Spirits recollect themſelves, ſet upon the matter remaining of the Feaver, and what they are able, begin to overcome it: then by a pertinacious aſſiduity, of coction, like a flame, wavering and half extinct, among green wood, at length riſe up victorious, and reſtore anew, both with heat and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leiſurely renewed, a quick and lively Fermentation, in the Heart.</p>
                     <p>So much in general of the Feaver called Putrid: it remains, before we deſcend to the kinds, and particular Caſes of it, that I recount the ſymptoms, and ſigns chiefly notable, in the courſe of this Feaver, and ſubjoyn the reaſons, and cauſes of them, and their manner of being done.</p>

                     <p>THE Symptoms, coming upon a Putrid Feaver, altho they argue, the oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of the whole Body, to be for the moſt part depraved, and the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and functions of ſome part, or Member hurt; yet, the accidents, which a Phyſician ought chiefly to conſider, about the Diagnoſis of this Diſeaſe, and its Prognoſis to be rightly inſtituted, may be referred to three caſſes or common places; to wit, they have reſpect to the Viſcera of Concoction, <hi>viz.</hi> the Ventricle, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:152521:58"/>
with their Appendixes: Or ſecondly, to the humours, flowing in the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, <hi>viz.</hi> the Blood in the Arteries and Veins, and the thin Liquor in the Nervous parts, together with the chief ſprings of either, <hi>viz.</hi> the Heart, and Brain; or laſtly, theſe ſymptoms reſpect the habit of the Body, with the various conſtitution of the pores, and the extenſion or emarceration of the ſolid parts. They, who would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly obſerve, the courſe of this Diſeaſe, and would fitly draw out Curatory intentions, may take notice of theſe three heads of ſymptoms, and carefully conſider, what altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may happen in theſe, as it were diſtinct Regions, according to the different times of the Feaver.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Troubles, and diſorders, ſuch as nauſeouſneſs, vomiting, want of Appetite, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtion, a looſeneſs, a ſcurfineſs of the Mouth and Tongue, a bitter favour, are wont to infeſt about the Ventricle, and firſt paſſages, in the whole courſe of this Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Theſe, for the moſt part, are attributed to the humors, firſt heaped together in the Stomach, and there putrifying: But beſides, that the recrements of the Chyle, being throughly roaſted, by too much heat, degenerate into an hurtful matter, very often, theſe kind of accidents happen, for that the Purgings, and the filth of the Blood, and Nervous Juice, whilſt they grow hot, are carried inward, and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in the membranes of the Viſcera, provoke Convulſions, and alſo make a filthy heap of vitious, and very infeſtous humor. I have often obſerved, that about the beginning of the Feaver, the Blood growing hot, laid aſide its recrements even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, with a benefit to the ſick, where, altho great moleſtations did ariſe about the firſt paſſages, yet the burning was therefore more mild, the Pulſe moderate, and the Urine laudable, and theſe being after this manner in a Feaver, quickly grew well, with a ſlender diet, and the uſe of gentle evacuations. But if in this caſe I ſhould admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter a vehement Cathartic, for the extirpating the humours, that Natural Purging of the Blood being hindred, preſently the Feaver became ſtrong, with a red Urine, and troubled, a deep Pulſe, Watchings, and other horrid ſymptoms: alſo, oftentimes after the ſtate of the Diſeaſe, by this kind of interior Luſtration or Purging, the aduſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and excrementitious, is ſeparated from the Blood. Hence, ſomtimes a Lask, ſomtimes a ſcurfie covering of the Mouth and Throat, follow: Wherefore, there is need of caution, about the accidents which happen in the firſt paſſages, leſt that whilſt we oppoſe them, we ſhould pervert the motion of Nature; and leſt whilſt we fortifie theſe parts, againſt the courſe of the Morbific matter, we untowardly keep the ſame ſhut up, in the maſs of Blood.</p>
                     <p>The Symptom chiefly to be conſidered, about the Bloody maſs, are, an heat dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed through the whole, a burning of the Praecordia, thirſt, a diſorder of the Pulſe, a red urine, a ſpontaneous weariſomneſs, a loſs of all ſtrength, out of which rightly conſidered, theſe things following may be known, <hi>viz.</hi> what the manner of the heat is, or with what tenour the burning Blood flames forth; what times of remiſſion, or of increaſe, its Efferveſcency obſerves, in the deflagration; whether it retains its Craſis, or mixture whole; for the burning of it, and circulation of it inkindled, what ſtrength of the Heart will ſuffice, and what ſpace the Veſſels may require; ſo long as the Blood burns, what plenty of aduſt recrements it may heap up, by what means it may overcome, ſeparate, or at leſt endeavour to ſeparate the ſame, and laſtly, what way of a Criſis it endeavours, and with what ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>The accidents, which have a reſpect to the thin Liquor, with the Brain, and Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Appendix, are, diſorders concerning ſleep and waking, a debility of the whole Body, a trembling, ſhivering, pains, Convulſive motions, Cramps of the Viſcera, Stupifaction, Phrenſie; and the obſervation of which ſuggeſts, what the temper, and conſtitution of that thin Liquor may be; by what means it waters, and influtes the Nervous parts, and performs its circutes through them; how the Animal Spirits execute the functions of the Viſcera; what the ſtate of the Brain may be, whether it remain free from the incurſion of the Feaveriſh matter, or whether it be not in danger of being overwhelmed, by reaſon of its critical metaſtaſis or tranſlation.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the habit of the body may be obſerved, what may be the reaſon of ſweating, and the manner of it; whether only by vaporous <hi>Effluvia?</hi> or by ſweats? or alſo by little wealks! whether the fleſh falls away on the ſudden from its wonted bulk? Or whether it retains it ſelf a long while? What the colour of the Face is! And the vigor or habit of the Eyes? from theſe well laid together, the courſe of the Feaver may be beſt of all meaſured; at what time it will come to its hight or ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Whether Nature will prevail over the Diſeaſe or not; with what manner of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:152521:58"/>
and with what ſucceſs ſhe will endeavor the expulſion of the Feaveriſh mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; alſo by theſe ſigns may be learned, by what degrees the Blood growing hot, and often congealed, doth tend towards Putrefaction, or Corruption; whether it does any thing concoct the alible Juice poured to it; or whether or not it preſently caſts forth of doors, all its proviſion by ſweat, as often happens in the declination of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>By theſe ſymptoms and ſigns, a yet more plentiful Indication may be had, if firſt it be known, upon what cauſes the ſeveral ſpecies of them depend; and by what provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they are wont to be raiſed up in our Body: wherefore I have thought it worth our labour to recount particularly the chief of theſe; and to explicate the reaſons of them, and their ways of working. But the ſymptoms, chiefly to be obſerved in a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Synochus, or continual fervor without intermiſſions, are, an heat in the whole Body, a ſpontaneous wearineſs, a burning of the Precordia, intolerable thirſt, an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, and ſcurfineſs of the Tongue, or Jawes, a pain of the head and loins, pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous watchings, Phrenſie, Convulſive motions, a Syncope, Heart-burning, Vomiting, Nauſeouſneſs, want of Appetite, a Looſneſs, a Flux, with which, not all at once, now with theſe, now with thoſe, this Diſeaſe is wont to be beſet.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Heat, which is felt ſharp and biteing, in the whole Body, depends upon the too great effervency of the Blood, and the accenſion of it in the Heart: For the Sulphureous or oily part of the Blood, being exalted, and taking an heat, is inkindled in the heart, in a double proportion, more than it was wont; wherefore, it copiouſly diffuſes, by its deflagration, <hi>effluvia</hi> of heat thorow the whole Body. When the Sulphur is leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and inkindled in the heart, as in the green ſickneſs, or the white dropſical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Heat is wanting in the whole: but in a Feaver, when the Sulphur too much burns forth, Heat ſuperabounds. For heat, depends not only upon the actual infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Sulphur, or the firing of it, but an intenſe heat is excited without fire, in many mixtures, where the particles of Sulphur are diſſolved by corroſion, or are more thickly heaped together for want of ventilation; wherefore, when Iron is corroded by any acid mineral Spirit, or when Spirit of Nitre is poured on the butter of Antimony, a mighty heat with a fume is produced; in like manner when Dung, or Hay laid up wet, are kept from ventilation, grow highly hot: it is the ſame reaſon, why the Blood burns above meaſure in Feavers, to wit, the particles of the Sulphur, being too much exalted and made hot, are more thickly heaped together in the Veſſels, and are more diſſolved, and as it were inkindled by the ferment of the Heart; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they every way diffuſe heat, being looſned in the bond of the mixture, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where ſtretched forth or expanſed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A ſpontaneous wearineſs or laſſitude, is felt in the whole Body: to wit, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Veſſels being diſtented with the boiling Blood, alſo the muſculous fleſh is very much ſtuffed with Blood, and a copious breath, that it is made leſs fit for motion, as they who are ſick of an Anaſarca, have their limbs very unwealdy by reaſon of the aboundance of ſerous humor: beſides, in Feavers, by reaſon of the inflamation of the Blood, the Juice, which is ſent for a ſupply to the nervous ſtock, departs from its due temper, that it becomes little fit, for the actuating the Body.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The burning of the Praecordia is made, by reaſon of the Blood being more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly enkindled in the Chimny of the Heart, which from thence boiles forth into the Lungs, with great ardency; wherefore, by how much the neerer this Region is to that fire place of heat, it is pierced therefore with the greater burning.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. An almoſt unquenchable Thirſt is cauſed, both from the glowing heat in the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia, alſo by reaſon of the ſharp and hot particles of the Feaveriſh matter, affixed to the ventricle, in the circulating of the Blood; which indeed, deſire to be waſhed, even as ſalted and ſpiced meats, being plentifully eaten, or alſo ſtrong, or ſour things, rouled in the mouth, or throat; for this kind of diſtemper, calls for a more free ſwallowing down of Drink, as a member too much heated, the pouring on of cold water.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The ardor, and ſcurfineſs of the Tongue, and Jawes, as alſo oftentimes an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of a certain white, or yellow, or black filth, happen without doubt, becauſe of the heat, and ſoot, exhaled from the Ventricle, and Lungs, burning with heat: but the Tongue grows white, as often as that humidity, (with which it is naturally much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued) is dried up, and parched, and ſo the exterior skin of the Tongue, is as it were roaſted, by the burning heat, from hence alſo it becomes ſcurfie; which is alſo ſeen in healthful people, when it happens, that the Tongue is ſcorched by broth, or any other very hot ſuppings; in like manner, as when the Tongues of Animals are boiled, for the uſe of the Table, their skin becomes white and ſharp or rugged. For whether the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:152521:59"/>
ſpittle is drawn from the maxillary glandulas, (as the doctrine of the moſt ingenious <hi>Wharton</hi> hath firſt made known) or any other humor from the glandulas of the Jawes, or elſewhere; yet becauſe, by the reaſon of the heat, and dryneſs, it grows too thick, and becomes clammy, alſo then the outward skin of the Tongue grows nevertheleſs white; but alſo it is covered with a certain filthy glew, to wit, becauſe that humor, by reaſon of its thickneſs, may ſmear the Tongue, but cannot wet, or moiſten it: but if it happens, that the Tongue is inwardly ſuffuſed, with a bilous humor, or outwardly tinged (as comes to paſs by the uſe of Choler-abounding Vomits) then its hairy nap, being ſpongy, imbibing the yellow poyſon, exhibits alſo the like colour. If that laſtly, the heat be ſo ſtrong, that it burns the Blood, and inkindles a fire, more ardent than uſual, it follows, that from the fire place of the Heart, the breathing places through the Lungs, ſcarcely ſufficing for the ventilating ſo great fire, ſoot or ſmoak is raiſed up, which being ſmitten to the furnace of the Pallat, ſtrikes againſt the Tongue, as it were in a reverberatory, and infects it with blackneſs. But this ſame kind of blackneſs, (and as other filthineſſes of the Tongue) is moſt conſpicuous in its middle parts, becauſe the more exterior compaſs, is cleanſed by its frequent rubbing againſt the gums and palate.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Somtimes it happens in Feavers, and eſpecially about their declinations, that the Tongue, palat, gums, yea the cavity of the whole mouth, and throat, are covered over with a certain viſcous matter, as it were a whitiſh cruſt; which being often wiped off, preſently new ſprings again, and unleſs by rubbing diligently, and waſhing the mouth, this cruſty matter be frequently wiped away, the ſick are in hazard of being choaked. This kind of diſtemper, is moſt often excited in Children newly born; for they are wont, for the moſt part, within fourteen days with an external growing hot, to be ſprinkled thorow the whole skin, with broad and red ſpots; if that this ſuffuſion of redneſs, do not freely break forth, or vaniſhes away ſooner than it ought, for the moſt part, this whitiſh cruſt follows, in the parts of the mouth. This ſymptom, when it troubles Infants, after this manner, is wont to be aſcribed to the fault of the Milk, to wit, that being to ſharp, it induces the ulcerous diſtemper of the mouth. In thoſe ſick with Feavers, it is commonly attributed to thick vapors, and ſoottie, elevated from the ventricle: But to me it ſeems moſt likely, that in either, this diſtemper ariſes, from the impurities of the whole Blood, (and perhaps in ſome meaſure of the nervous Juice) depoſited about theſe parts: for, as often as in the maſs of either humor, any extraneous thing intimately mixed, is contained, that it is not to be diſperſed by ſweat, nor eaſily ſent away by Urine, that, moſt often, is fixed, with the ſerous filth about the mouth; from whence Catarrhs, tumors, and troubleſom ſpittings are cauſed: For when for the chewing of the meats, the ſalival humor in this place ought to be plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſuffuſed; nature very often endeavors to ſend forth of doors, what is ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or otherways troubleſome, by theſe uſual ways of excretion. Hence from <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> being taken, when both the Blood, and nervous Juice, are abundantly ſtuffed, with its moſt ſmally divided particles, and endeavor to thruſt them forth, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved with <hi>ſerum,</hi> becauſe they are not able to exterminate thoſe mercurial little Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, being intimately confuſed, neither by ſweat, urine, or by any other ways, what is remaining, they endeavor to expel thorow the Arteries, and other paſſages, which ſupply the mouth with ſpittle, the ſame being involved with the ſerous Latex. Alſo in like manner, in Feavers, when from a long deflagration of the Blood, the aduſt matter is very much heaped together, of which no ſmall part remaining, after the Criſis, is yet confounded with the Blood, and nervous Juice, being fixed either to the brain, or to ſome other place, from them it is at length ſupped up again, 'tis moſt probable, that this matter, is throughly roaſted, by a long concoction, and ſo becomes almoſt like Glew, thick, wherefore, being not able to be diſperſed, neither by ſpittle, or inſenſible tranſpiration, nor to be ſeparated by the urinarie paſſages, but at length leiſurely runs out, by the little Arteries, and other paſſages of the ſpittle, lying open into the Palat, as the moſt uſual way of excretion, and forthwith by reaſon of its thickneſs grows into that glewineſs. The ſame reaſon holds in Infants, whoſe Blood being made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, by filths contracted in the Womb, preſently it endeavors to purifie it ſelf, by that exterior putting forth, which if it do not rightly ſucceed, by reaſon of the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the matter, immediatly the viſcous impurities, are exterminated by this way, as the more open. I have known ſome, in the declination of a Feaver, to whom, not only this kind of Cruſt of gummy matter, has hapned in the parts of the mouth, but a copious ſalivation, as if they had taken mercury, with a ſtinking of the breath,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:152521:59"/>
alſo a ſwelling of the Tongue, and Gums, hath been raiſed up for many days.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The pain of the Head, in Feavers is excited, becauſe of the Meninges of the Brain, being pulled or hauled with vapors, and with a ſharp Blood, and hot; for the Blood being impetuouſly moved, by reaſon of the direction of the great Arterie, is carried in a greater plenty to the Head, than to the lower parts; becauſe the paſſage, from the boſom of the Heart to the head, is ſtrait, from the ſame, to the inferior mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, oblique, and as it were reflected; wherefore, as the membranes are very ſenſible, and that there the Blood is ſtopped, and reverberated, in its rapid courſe, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if cruel headaches are excited in Feavers. Beſides, this impetuous flowing of the Blood, wherewith (as it were by a certain Ramming) the membranes of the Head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtended, ake grievouſly; alſo ſomtime, Headaches ariſe, by reaſon of the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Juice, (which is ſupplyed from the burning Blood) being too ſharp, and prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: wherefore, when the membranes, and nervous parts, are watered, with the ſame, they being pulled by its acrimony, are moved into Pains and Convulſions.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. In like manner alſo, the other diſtempers of the Head, as watchings, delirium, Phrenſie, Convulſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ariſe, ſomtimes from the Blood being in a rage, and ſo ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up inordinate motions in the Brain, and ſomtimes alſo, from the nervous Juice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing depraved, and therefore made improportionate, to the regiment of the Animal Spirits: But moſt often, theſe kind of ſymptoms are frequent in Feavers, by reaſon of the tranſlation of the Feaveriſh matter, from the boſom of the Blood, into theſe parts. For the Blood, being full of the aduſt recrements, remaining after the deflagration, endeavors (like the flowring of new Wine) to ſubdue, and exclude them from its Company, by every manner of way; which, a Flux being ariſen, when it cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel by Sweat, Urine, or bleeding, it oftentimes transfers, to the ſubſtance of the Brain, and there fixes them: and from hence chiefly, the aforſaid diſtempers, when they are fixed, and firmly rooted, draw their original, when as the lighter, and that are eaſily moved, often proceed from the afore-recited cauſes.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Convulſive motions, happen in Feavers, for divers cauſes: ſomtimes, becauſe of the matter being heaped together in the firſt paſſages, which there haules the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous parts, with its notable pravity, and then, by the conſent of the nervous ſtock, the Convulſion is preſently Communicated to the beginning of the Nerves, in the Brain, and by that means draws aſide now theſe, and now thoſe parts: by which means, Worms abounding in the Viſcera, ſharp humors being ſtirred, and ſtrong Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, induce Convulſions: or ſecondly, when the Feaver, is a partaker of ſome malignity, ſo in the ſmall Pox, Meaſels, or the Plague, frequently Convulſions happen; to wit, becauſe the Blood is altered, from its benign and natural temper, into a deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and venomous, by which the Nerves, and their beginnings, are pierced, and forced into Convulſions. Alſo, oftentimes without the ſuſpition of malignity, in a putrid Feaver, Convulſive motions are induced, by reaſon of the tranſlation of the Feave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh matter, to the Brain, as was but now intimated: ſo I have often obſerved, when the Diſeaſe is not preſently cured with the Criſis, the ſick ly by it, with a tedious ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and are made obnoxious to tremblings, and Convulſive motions. Thirdly, and laſtly, for the moſt part in every Feaver, which terminates in Death, Convulſive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the ſad forerunners of it; which I think to happen, not only from the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the matter, with which the nervous ſtock is pulled and pierced, but becauſe the Spirits, very much exhauſted and debilitated, do not ſufficiently blow up, and diſtend the Bodies of the Nerves, wherefore, being releaſed from their wonted extenſion, and tonick motion, they are however by a more weak indeavor of the Spirits, agitated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a diſordered motion.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. A ſyncope or ſwooning, is wont to be raiſed up ſeveral ways in Feavers, but chiefly for theſe three cauſes, to wit, either from the mouth of the Ventricle being diſtempered, which part, as it is interwoven with a manifold texture of Nerves, is very ſenſible, and becauſe from the ſame branch of the ſixth pare, little ſhoots of Nerves, are equally derived to the heart, and to the Ventricle, of the Orifice of the Ventricle, ſo implanted with Nerves, be diſtempered, with any great trouble, it is alſo Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the heart, and either the motion is ſtopped in it, or at leaſt an inordinate one is excited, whereby the equal Flux of the Spirits, and the Blood, is interrupted for a time. I knew one in an acute Feaver, taken with a frequent ſwooning, which diſtemper wholly ceaſed, after he had caſt forth by Vomit, a long and ſmooth Worm. Secondly, a ſyncope alſo, is ſomtimes induced, becauſe the invenomed matter is circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:152521:60"/>
with the Blood, which ſuddenly fixes, and extinguiſhes the vital Spirits, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geals the Blood it ſelf, that it is apt to ſtagnate in the heart, as uſually happens in the Peſt, ſmall Pox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which we ſhall ſpeak particularly hereafter. Thirdly, a ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope is wont to happen, by reaſon of the more rare texture of the Spirits, which as they are very tender and ſubtil, are eaſily unbent, by any immoderate motion or pain: ſo I have known ſome, who being quiet in bed, have found themſelves well enough, but being removed from one place to another, preſently have ſwooned away.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The pain of the Heart happens in Feavers, when the Ventricle, and eſpecially its Orifices, by reaſon of the manifold inſertions of Nerves, being very ſenſible, are beſet with a ſharp and bitteriſh humor, or elſe with an acid, and corroſive; for hence a pain and trouble ariſes from the acrimony of the humor, after the ſame manner, as when the ſphincter of the fundament is afflicted, in Cholloric dejections, with pain and moleſtation.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. By reaſon of the ſame cauſe, Vomiting, and nauſeouſneſs are wont to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, to wit, by the Ventricles being beſet, and irritated to a Convulſion, from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous matter, and not akin to it ſelf: Such an excrementitious matter, may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in the Ventricle, by three ways; for either the aliments, partly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a want of an acid ferment, by which they ſhould be rightly Cooked, and partly by reaſon of the burning heat of the Ventricle, are roaſted into ſuch a Corruption; or Secondly, this kind of matter, is laid up in the Ventricle, from the Arteries, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in its Cavity, as uſes to happen in the ſmall Pox, the Plague, and malignant Feavers; or Thirdly, meer Choler, being preſſed forth from the Choleduct Veſſels, into the empty inteſtine, by reaſon of an inverſe motion, and as it were Convulſive, of that inteſtine, it is poured into the Ventricle, want of Appetite, alſo happens, by reaſon of the Ventricles abounding with vitious Juices, and becauſe the acid ferment, is wholly perverted, by the ſcorching heat. Theſe kind of diſtempers of the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, and Viſcera, ſomtimes ariſe from an excrementitious matter, (to wit, alimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, degenerated in the concoction) heaped together, a long while before the Feaver, in the firſt paſſages, which not ſeldom becomes, the occaſional cauſe, of the Feaver it ſelf: but ſomtimes, nauſeouſneſs, want of Appetite, Vomiting, pain of the Heart <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the immediate products of the Feaver; for when the day before the ſickneſs, thoſe diſtempered, have been well enough in their Stomack, as ſoon as the immoderate heat of the Blood was induced, whilſt it boiled up above meaſure, both the <hi>Effluvia,</hi> and the recrements, being wonted to be evaporated outwardly, alſo the bilous humor, flowing out of the Choleduct Veſſels, are poured into the Ventricle; by which, its Craſis is overthrown; alſo the Reliques of the Chyle, and other contents in the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera, are egregiouſly depraved; from whence, the aforeſaid Diſtempers draw their Original.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. No leſs frequent a ſymptom in Feavers, is a Diarrhea, or Flux of the Belly, which ſomtime happens about the begining of the Diſeaſe, and ariſes (for the moſt part) either from the Bile, flowing forth of the Coleduct Veſſels, into the <hi>Duodenum;</hi> or from the recrements of the Blood, and Nervous Juice, poured forth from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and the paſſage of the Pancreas, into the inteſtines. All the aforeſaid humors, (but eſpecially the Choleric) when they are ſupplied in abundance, often Ferment with the maſs remaining of the Chyme, that the ſame ſwelling up with a ſpumous rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, irritates the inteſtines, and provokes to the motion of excretion: ſomtimes alſo, about the ſtanding of the Diſeaſe, and in the declination of it, a Lask is exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and ſo, either Nature being Conquereſs, the more thick purgings of the Blood, are this way critically ſifted forth; or being overcome, the Flux of the Belly, is the effect, and ſign, of the Viſcera wholly loſing their ſtrength, and firm tenour. It ſomtimes happens in a Feaver, that the Belly is always bound, that it is not at all looſned, but by Phyſick, and tho the ſick take nothing but liquid things, for many days, the ſtools are ſtill of a ſolid conſiſtence, and hard, this ſeems for the moſt part to be done, when the Blood growing ſharply and exceeding hot, like fire, conſumes the humidities, wherever they flow, and draws to it ſelf, out of the Bowels, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery matter, by a Copious emiſſion of vapours, and preſently makes it to be evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated outwardly: wherefore, the thicker part, being left in the inteſtines, is made firm, from the ſcorching heat, as it were a <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> remaining after diſtillation.</p>
                     <p>A Dyſſentery is a diſtemper, ſo frequent in continual Feavers, that ſome years it becomes Epidemical, and not more mild than the Plague, kills many: The cauſe of it is wont to be, not any humor produced within in the Viſcera, that corrodes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:152521:60"/>
with its Acrimony, (as ſome affirm) but a certain infection impreſſed on the Blood, and ſo intimately confuſed with it, that, under the form of a vapour, or a ſincere humor, it cannot be pulled away from the Blood: wherefore, the thruſting forwards, towards the inteſtines, unlocks the little mouths of the Arteries, and makes there little Ulcers, and exudations or flowings forth of the Blood, like as when from the Feaveriſh Blood. Puſtles and inflamations break forth outwardly, with a flowring towards the skin: But it is moſt likely, theſe dyſenteric diſtempers, which accompany Malignant, or Epidemical Feavers, ariſe from a certain coagulation of the Blood, as ſhall be more fully declared hereafter.</p>
                     <p>And here alſo, among the ſymptoms of Feavers, might be recited, what are wont to appear outwardly, in the ſuperficies of the Body, as are Spots, Whelks, Buboes, Carbuncles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but becauſe theſe belong after an eſpecial manner to a Malignant Feaver, therefore we will forbear in this place, from the conſideration of them, until we ſhall ſpeak of the Plague, Small-pox, the Peſtilential, and Malignant Feaver.</p>
                     <p>The Pulſe and Urine ſhall conclude here the troop of ſymptoms and ſigns in a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Feaver, which are much heeded, for the finding out, both the ſtate and the ſtrength of the ſick: For, as there are two things, by which our life is propped, <hi>viz.</hi> Heat inkindled in the Heart, and concoction to be made in the Viſcera, and Veſſels, becauſe the Pulſe and Urine, beſt ſhow the alterations in either, induced in a Feaver, therefore from hence, a moſt certain judgment is taken of this Diſeaſe, about to end, in Death or Health. I think it is not needful, to ſpeak of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſe at large, or to recount the ſeveral cauſes and differences of either: It will ſuffice for me to note here, the chiefeſt things of them, and what are worthy of conſideration in the courſe of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. And firſt of all the Pulſe is conſulted, as it were a Thermometer or Weather-Glaſs, conſtituted by Nature, that from thence, the heat inkindled, in a Feaver might be meted; which if it ſhould be more ſtrong, ſtirs up a great ebullition or boiling up of the Blood, the Artery beats more ſtrongly and quicker, ſo long as the Spirits are in ſtrength; then they being a little exhauſted, the more ſtrong Pulſe is remitted; which however is compenſated with ſwiftneſs, and is made quick, and ſmall. If the Feaver be gentler, and is troubled with a leſſer burning, the Pulſe alſo declines leſs, from its Natural condition, and the moderation of this, in the whole courſe of the Diſeaſe, denotes the truces of Nature. Neither doth the Pulſe only, betray the forces of the Feaver, as of an Enemy, but ſhews alſo plainly the ſtrength of Nature, and her ability of reſiſting. So long as the Pulſe is laudable, the matter goes well, and it ſhews good hopes; but from the evil ſtate of this, a bad omen is ſhewn, and a deſpair of Health. So without a frequent, and diligent examination of the Pulſe a Phyſician connot make a right judgment or Prognoſtication, or ſafely preſcribe Phyſick.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the firſt thing, it ought to be known (as much as may be) what every ones Pulſe is, according to its Natural Conſtitution; for it is in theſe ſtronger, in thoſe weaker: then it is to be conſidered, in every moment of the Feavers, by what degrees it is diſtant from its Natural ſtate: for now it is ſomtimes more vehement, and argues the Feaver to grow ſtronger; now it is depreſſed, below its wont, and denotes the Spirits and Strength dejected.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe whoſe Pulſe in Health beats weakly and languiſhing, when taken with a Feaver, if they have a ſmall and weak Pulſe, it is not ſo evil a ſign, that we ſhould preſently deſpair of their Health: In whom the Pulſe is by Nature ſtrong and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if after the Criſis of the Diſeaſe, it hath ſcarce a moderate vigour, tho it be not wholly weak, it argues the condition of the ſick to be ſuſpected, and not ſafe.</p>
                     <p>If from the begining of the Feaver, before the Blood has flamed out, or if a Criſis being made, when part of the burthen is drawn away, or at another time, without an evident cauſe, the Pulſe becomes weak, it portends evilly: but if after long watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or great evacuations, the Pulſe is made a little weaker, Health is not therefore to be deſpaired of, becauſe the ſtrength caſt down by theſe means, or overwhelmed, may be reſtored, and the Spirits renewed.</p>
                     <p>When the Pulſe is ſuddenly altered for the worſe tho the ſick ſeem to be better, as to the reſt of the ſymptoms, you may foreſpeak the ſad prognoſtication of Death; and ſo contrariwiſe, altho moſt horrid ſymptoms urge, and yet the Pulſe is laudable, Health may be yet hoped for. If in a ſtrong man, that hath a Feaver, the Pulſe is very ſmall, and creepingly, or becomes like the motion of Ants, death is at hand.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:152521:61"/>2. In the exhibiting of Medicines, cautions and rules of no ſmall moment are taken; Purging and Vomiting are forbid, by the pulſe being too quick and violent; alſo by being low and depreſſed; becauſe, whilſt the Blood is too fervent, evacuation helps little, becauſe both what is hurtful is not ſeparated, alſo for that by the pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, the ſtrength or ſpirits, are more debilitated. But when the ſpirits are broken, and ſtrength caſt down, Medicines caſt them more down, and ſomtimes wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws them. Wherefore, when a Phyſitian thinks of evacuation, upwards or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he firſt examines the pulſe, and goes about this work only, when Nature is ſtrong and quiet; that ſhe may at once be at leiſure, for the operation of the Medicine, and may have ſufficient ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Nor is there leſs need of circumſpection, in ſweating Medicines and Cordials: which, if adminiſtred in the Feaveriſh fit, do too much ſtrengthen, the former violent motion of the Heart, and oftentimes break its ſtrength; alſo, when the Pulſe is very languid, if hot and ſtrong Cordials are adminiſtred, (as when a ſmall flame is troubled with a more ſtrong blaſt of wind) life is eaſily extinguiſhed; wherefore, tis a vulgar obſervation, that Cordials often accelerate death, for that by too much troubling the Blood, they ſooner beat down ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>There is yet the moſt need of the caution, and direction of the Pulſe, in exhibiting narcoticks; for theſe, (becauſe they perform their work by extinguiſhing, and fixing the too fierce vital ſpirits) if uſed in a weak or inconſtant Pulſe, either by diminiſhing the vital ſpirits, render them wholly inſufficient for the Diſeaſe, or by ſuffocating them too much, cauſe a perpetual ſleep: wherefore, in a languid, unequal, or formicating or creeping Pulſe, opiats are to be ſhun'd, more than a mad Dog or a Snake.</p>
                     <p>An unequal, and intermitting Pulſe, has a moſt evil report, from the writings of Phyſitians; yet, altho of an ill note, does not ſo certainly portend death, as a weak Pulſe: for I have known many, to have recovered, tho by thoſe kind of ſigns con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the Grave; becauſe the inordination of the Spirits, and the Blood, may be more certainly and eaſily compoſed, or allayed, than their dejection reſtored.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The inſpection of Urines in Feavers, before all other Diſeaſes whatſoever, hath more of certainty, and is of greateſt uſe: for from hence, the conditions of the ſick, and of the Diſeaſe are beſt known, and the medical intentions, concerning what is to be done, are better directed; what obſervations, and rules, concerning this thing, are vulgarly ſet forth, are ſo many, that it would be almoſt an infinite labour and tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to recount them all: it will be ſufficient here, to note the chief of them.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Urines of perſons in Feavers, there are chiefly to be conſidered, the colour, conſiſtency, contents, and ſubſidency or ſetling. The colour of the Urine, ſhews the meaſure, or exceſs of heat in the Blood; which, as it is increaſed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more remiſs; the Urine alſo is more, or leſs red; the cauſe of which is, the ebullition of the Blood or the efferveſcency induced from the Feaver, to the Blood; by reaſon of which, the particles of Salt, and Sulphur, implanted in the Blood, humors, and ſolid parts, are more diſſolved, and incocted with the <hi>ſerum,</hi> and impart to it a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; even as, when Salt of Tartar, and common Sulphur being mixed one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and boiled in water, impart a deep red colour to the Liquor.</p>
                     <p>The Urines of ſome, are highly red, when they are but a little, or lightly Feaveriſh: and on the contrary, the Urines of others, labouring with a Feaveriſh burning, are leſs coloured. Who abound with lively heat, and a very hot Blood, or are obnoxious to the Scurvy, phthifis, or hypochondriac diſtemper, when by taking cold, condenſation, ſurfeit, or drinking of Wine, they are troubled by any little Feaver, they render a Urine ſtrongly red: for that the particles of Salt and Sulphur, remain exalted in their Blood, and before half looſned; wherefore, there is a neceſſity, that the Feaver urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they are more boiled in the <hi>ſerum;</hi> on the contrary, they who are indued with a cold temper, with a faint and weak Pulſe, being taken with a Feaver, with a greater efferveſcency of the Blood, render their Urine leſs coloured.</p>
                     <p>The conſiſtency, contents, and ſubſidency of Urines, being put as it were upon the ſame thrid, depend all of them, on the aduſt and recrementitious matter, which is remaining in the Blood, after the Feaveriſh deflagration: if there ſhall be plenty of this, the conſiſtency of the Urine becomes ſomwhat thicker, and after it has ſtood, it is troubled by the cold: but if there be a leſſer quantity of this, or otherways derived than to the Reins, (to wit, by ſweat, or is called away by a critical tranſlation, to this or that part) the conſiſtency is made thinner, and the Liquor remains clear. Alſo the particles of this matter, do inlarge the contents of the Urine, which ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:152521:61"/>
diverſly, according as the nutricious Juice, is now ſomwhat cooked, and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milated by the Blood, now altogether perverted, and carried into a putrifaction, ſome ſigns of concoction, and aſſimulation, ſhew themſelves, in the Urines of Feaveriſh perſons, now a laudable Hypoſtaſis now ſome marks and rudiments of the ſame: A want of Hypoſtaſis, and the confuſion, and perturbation of the Urine, denote the concoction vitiated, But as this matter is more or leſs roaſted, in the Blood, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents are now of a pale, now of a red colour, like oker. By reaſon, that the recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, confounded with the Blood, either the Spirit being ſtrong, begin to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and ſeparated, or the ſame being depreſſed too much, they are leſs able to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, alſo the contents of the Urine, are wont to be more or leſs, ſooner or ſlower ſeparated, from the reſt of the Liquor, and to ſink down towards the bottom.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſticks, to be taken from the Urine, we may take notice, that the colour of the Urine being ſomwhat more remiſs, the conſiſtency mean, the contents few, and the ſubſiding free or eaſily collected into a Cloud, portend good: on the contrary, a deep red, a thick and troubled conſiſtency, thick and cloudy contents, which ſlowly or ſcarce at all ſink to the bottom, denote a very great heat, plenty of aduſt matter, and its being brought under, and ſecretion, difficult or fruſtrated.</p>
                     <p>As to the Medicinal directions, the buſineſs depends on this, that we attend, by the frequent inſpection of the Urine, the motion of Nature, and be helpful to the ſame; neither is it to be moved, by purge or ſweat, but when a certain hypoſtaſis of the Urine ſhews ſigns of concoction and ſeparation. I thought it needleſs to ſay any more here concerning this matter, becauſe thoſe things are more largly handled elſewhere, in a proper place, which belong to Urines.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the Kinds, and Cure of a Putrid Synochus, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Feaver.</head>
                     <p>ANd thus much for a Putrid Synochus in general, in which is deſcribed its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal reaſon, according to the accidents and ſymptoms which are commonly obſerved in its Figure; there are beſides, (I ſhall not ſay ſpecies but) ſome varieties, or irregularities of this Diſeaſe, in which, this Feaver ſomtimes declines from this common Rule, and by reaſon of ſome accidental Diſtempers, gets new names and diſtinctions.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place therefore, a Putrid Synochus is wont to be divided into Sympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, and eſſential; It is called Symptomatick, which draws its beginning from ſome other Diſtemper, or Diſeaſe before excited in the Body, ſo that the Feaver, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſymptom, coming upon that other Diſeaſe: of which ſort is accounted, what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the ſquinancy, pluriſie, the inflamation or impoſthume of the Lungs, or any impoſthume from a wound, or ulcer in a principle part, or its neighbourhood, of which we think a little otherways, <hi>viz.</hi> That truly no Putrid Feaver is merely Sympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical; perhaps it may ariſe occaſionally, from ſome other Diſtemper; but it is founded immediatly, in the Sulphureous part of the Blood being made too hot, and as it were inkindled: for without a Procatarſis, or preceeding indiſpoſition of the Blood, the aforeſaid Diſtempers, rarely, or not at all, cauſe a Putrid Feaver.</p>
                     <p>As to what reſpects the ſquinancy, pluriſie, the inflamation or impoſthume of the Lungs, and the like; I ſay, that theſe are the products of the Feaver, or Diſtempers following it; but by no means the cauſe of it; for moſt often the evident cauſe, went before, which produced the Feaveriſh efferveſcency of the Blood, as a taking of cold evacuation being hindered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then, altho the ſick do not openly grow preſently into a Feaver, yet a greater ebullition of the Blood, than was wont, is ſtirred up, as may be eaſily conjectured from the Urine, Pulſe, and inquietude of the whole Body. After ſome days, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nhw ſooner, now later) an Inflamation is brought forth, in one part or other; the reaſon of which, may probable enough be ſaid to be of this ſort: The
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:152521:62"/>
Blood, by reaſon of the <hi>effluvia</hi> being retained, (which are like ferment) is increaſed in its bulk, and grows more turgid than its wont, in the Veſſels; and when for want of Ventilation, it is ſtreightned in the ſpace of its circulation, it eaſily ſprings forth, where it can find a paſſage, through the Arteries, and being extravaſated, from the broken thred of Circulation, it gathers together into a Tumor: and becauſe from this kind of tumor, an heat, and pain, are increaſed in the part, the Blood is more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed in its motion, and ſo the Feaver, at firſt inkindled, is more aggravated.</p>
                     <p>Further, in theſe kind of Diſtempers, we may take notice, of a certain aptitude of the Blood to be coagulated, whereby it is made leſs fluid, ſo that it is apt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed in the leſſer Veſſels: even as it is to be perceived in Milk, when it begins to ſour, for then it will not be boiled, nor heated over the fire, without coagulation: and in like manner, there is to be ſuſpected in the Blood, a certain diſpoſition to growing ſour, by reaſon of which, it is made more obnoxious to coagulation; for it eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that in a pluriſie, a peripneumonia, the ſquinancy, and the like Diſeaſes, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation, or extravaſation of the Blood, does not always depend on the exuberancy of the Blood, and plenitude of the Veſſels: for oftentimes, the Blood is ſtopped in its motion, with a weak pulſe, and a ſinking down of the Veſſels, and being extravaſated in the ſide, or elſewhere, cauſes a moſt acute pain, yea being driven from one part, by and by it is fixed in another: and ſomtimes it begins to ſtagnate in the heart it ſelf, and there oftentimes induces a deadly oppreſſion: wherefore, ſome pluritical people, are wont, when the pains are gone, to complain of a great burthen, and as it were weight, fixed about the region of the Heart: And when we have opened the dead Bodies, of ſuch as have dyed of theſe kind of Diſeaſes, we have ſeen the Blood to be gathered together, in little bits, or oblong gobblets, in the ſecret parts of the Heart, and round about the cavities of the Veſſels. But for that theſe Diſeaſes, are wont to be handled apart from the Feaver, therefore we ſhall ſay no more of them here.</p>
                     <p>It only remains, that we inquire, whether the Feaver which accompanies theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, is to be eſteemed in the rank of thoſe, that are called Putrid, or not? To which we reply, that moſt often, they are ſimple Feavers, in which only a ſubtil, and ſpirituous part of the Blood is inflamed; and therefore, it the extravaſated Blood may be reſtored to circulation, by a plentiful detraction of the Blood, or an emptying the Veſſels by ſweat, preſently the growing hot of the Blood is appeaſed, and the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhortly allayed. But ſomtimes, when a prediſpoſition, as in a Plethora, or fulneſs of good humor, or in a great Cacochymie or fulneſs of evil Juices, brings it on, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the ſame kind of diſtempers, a Putrid Feaver is inkindled, wholly from the ſame cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Among the ſymptomatick Feavers, is reckoned that which is commonly called the ſlow Feaver: they who are ſick of this, are more than uſually hot, eſpecially after eating, any motion, or exerciſe; the Urine for the moſt part is red, the Spirits are feeble; and ſtrength caſt down, as to their appetite, and reſt, they are indifferently well, they have neither Cough, nor much ſpitting, but they daily (like thoſe in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions) grow lean, without any evident cauſe. The fault for the moſt part is aſcribed, to obſtructions in ſome inward, (as the liver, ſpleen, or meſentery) by whoſe default, the aliment is not well Cooked, nor rightly diſpenſed. But it ſeems to me, that this ſort of diſtemper, is immediatly founded in the evil diſpoſition of the Blood, by which it is inclined, into a too ſalt and ſour temper, and therefore is rendred leſs apt for nutrition, and an equal circulation. For the Blood in the Heart, juſt like oil in a Lamp, if it redounds too much with ſaline Particles, is inkindled not pleaſantly, and equally, but with a noiſe, and great evaporation of the parts; whereby indeed, it is ſooner waſted, and exhibits but a languiſhing, and weak flame. I opened one, ſomtime ſince dead of this Diſeaſe, in whom the Viſcera deſtinated to concoction, were well enough, but the Lungs were without moiſture, and dry, and beſet through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with a ſandy matter like Chaulk. Alſo oftentimes, in this Diſeaſe, the Meſentery is beſet, the glandules being filled with ſuch a Chaulky matter: But whether the Blood being made more ſaltiſh, doth firſt bring in theſe kind of diſtempers of the Viſcera, or whether the Dyſcraſie, or evil diſpoſition of the Viſcera, firſt brings it upon the Blood is uncertain: it ſeems probable, that either diſtemper depends upon the other, and that the cauſes of either evil are reciprocal.</p>
                     <p>But the Feaver, which chiefly deſerves to be called <hi>Symptomatic,</hi> is that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in Phthiſical perſons, from an Ulcer, or Conſumption of the Lungs. For the whole Blood, whilſt it paſſes thorow the Lungs, in its circulation, often impreſſes on this
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:152521:62"/>
Inward, the ideas of very many Diſeaſes; and on the other ſide, receives the ſame from it, being evilly affected, whatſoever impure thing is conteined in the maſs of the Blood, as the flowring of New Wine, is caſt forth by extremities of the Arteries; wherefore, when Nature being made more weak, it cannot transfer its recrements into the ſuperficies of the Body, it depoſes them, by a more near Purgation into the Lungs. From hence a Cacochymia, or fulneſs of ill juices, and many Chronical Diſeaſes, end in a Conſumption: in like manner, when the fleſh of the Lungs waſts, or abounding with an Ulcerous matter, becomes half putrid, the Blood paſſing through it, is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the purulent matter, or tabid infection, and for that cauſe, is ſtirred up into a continual Efferveſcency, by reaſon of the confuſion of ſomthing not miſcible, and wherefore, it induces an aſſiduous Feaver, and wholly perverts the Alible Juice. The ſame reaſon is, of Feavers, form an Ulcer, or Impoſthume, oftentimes raiſed up in other parts: for theſe, even as the tabid conſtitution of the Lungs, cauſe oftentimes a Conſumption, and Hectick Feaver. The full conſideration of theſe, are not for this place, wherefore, we will return, whence we have digreſſed, to a Putrid Feaver pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called, or eſſential.</p>
                     <p>The Eſſential Putrid Synochus, is wont to be divided, into a Putrid (ſuch as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deſcribed) into a Cauſon, or hot burning Feaver; and beſides into a Quotidian, Tertian, and Quartan: The Putrid Synochus, but now delineated, ought to be the rule or ſquare of the reſt, to whoſe type, moſt Feavers, which are of this kind, are to be compoſed. As to the reſt, but now mentioned, according as they vary their kind, I ſhall briefly ſubjoyn.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſon, or Burning Feaver, is that which performs its courſe, with a greater heat, almoſt intolerable thirſt, and other ſymptoms, arguing a greater inflamation of the Blood: The formal reaſon of it, by which it is differenced from the reſt, conſiſts in this; that the temper of the Blood is hotter, that is, abounds more with fireable Sulphur; therefore, when it grows fervent, it is inkindled in a greater plenty, and with its deflagration, diffuſes the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of a moſt intenſe heat, through the whole Body: its motion is acute, and quickly comes to its ſtanding, it is compaſſed about with more horrid ſymptoms, hath a difficult Criſis, and an even full of danger.</p>
                     <p>But as to what reſpects thoſe periods, or fits, in which a Putrid Feaver ſomtimes is wont to be more cruel, at a ſet time; and (as if intermitting) now every day, now every third, or fourth day, repeats as it were the Feaveriſh fit; the reaſon of this ſeems not eaſily to be explicated: eſpecially, if we reject from this cenſe, the fewer humors, to the ſpontaneous motion of which, this diſtemper is commonly aſcribed, concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what ſeems moſt likely to me, I ſhall doubtingly propoſe. In a continual Feaver, there are two chief things, (as we have already noted) which for the moſt part induce the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fervency of the Blood; to wit, the exaltation and inkindling of the Sulphureous part of the Blood, then conſequently, an heaping together of the aduſt matter, and remaining after the burning of the Blood, to a ſwelling up: upon the former the continuance of the Feaver, upon the other, its ſtanding, and critical perturbations, depend: to theſe ſome times, a certain third thing happens, to wit, a fulneſs, and ſwelling up of the crude Juice, from the Aliments newly taken; which in a continual Feaver, (as in the fits of Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Feavers) induces a greater Effervency, at ſet intervals of times. But why this does not always happen, nor wholly after the ſame manner, the reaſon is this: when the Putrid Synochus is very acute, and the whole Blood almoſt is quickly inflamed, and highly rages, whatſoever of Nutritious Juice, is poured to the Blood, is preſently burnt, and conſumed by the fire; wherefore, little or nothing of it, is conteined in the maſs of Blood, for the matter of a fit. But if this Feaver be leſs acute, and the Blood only flames forth moderately, and in parts, the ſupplement of the crude Juice, is not wholly conſumed, by the burning; but is perverted, by a more gentle fire, into a Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative matter, which, when it ariſes in the Veſſels to a fulneſs of ſwelling up, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a Flux, and by its Effervency, makes ſtronger the Feaveriſh heat, before glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Blood, as it were by the coming of new fewel. The flowring of this matter doth not ſeldom begin with a light ſhivering, or cold, and ſomtimes end with ſweat: but for the moſt part, it is exhaled by inſenſible tranſpiration. In every fit, beſides the proviſion of the degenerate Nutritious Juice, ſomthing from the aduſt, and burnt matter of the Blood, evaporates; wherefore, the Criſis of the Diſeaſe, is drawn forth longer, that tis hardly cured, under eleven or fourteen days; yea (for the moſt part) in this ſort of Feaver, with fits and remiſſions coming between, the perfect Cure of the Diſeaſe happens, ſcarcely within twenty days: and ſomtimes leiſurely, without
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:152521:63"/>
any through Criſis, it remits, and then, by a long declination, it is ended in Death, or Health.</p>
                     <p>But that this kind of remiſſion, and acerbation or growing more violent, are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, according to the type of an Intermitting Feaver, that they repeat their turns now every day, now every other day, and ſomtimes not but within four days, the reaſon of this is to be ſought, from the Doctrine before delivered, of Intermitting Feavers: to wit, that according as the Dyſcraſie of the Blood, diverſly appears, the ſuppliment of the degenerate Nutritious Juice, ariſes to the fulneſs of ſwelling up, either ſooner or later; and for that reaſon, its Effervency, cauſes now more frequent, now more rare fits in this Feaver.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Cure of Putrid Feavers, of every kind, there are four general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, on which, the whole ſtreſs of the matter depends. Firſt, that the Blood, (if it may be done) may be defended from burning, and the flame, or fire inkindled in its Sulphureous part, be wholly ſuppreſſed; which about the firſt beginning of this Diſeaſe, happens to be often brought about. Secondly, that when the Blood having taken fire, cannot be preſently extinguiſhed, that at leaſt it may perform its burning more mildly, and with leſſer hurt. Thirdly, the deflagration being ended, that the Liquor of the Blood, be freed from the recrements of the aduſt and burnt matter, and afterwards reſtored, to its Natural temper and vigor. Fourthly, that the ſymptoms chiefly troubling may be timely helped, the which, unleſs taken away, will fruſtrate the work both of Nature and Medicine.</p>
                     <p>As to particular Remedies, with which theſe intentions may be ſerved, there are various preſcriptions, and forms of Medicines, not only among Phyſicians, but alſo among old women and Emperies, ordinarily in uſe: from which however, like a Sword in a blind mans hand, uſed without difference, and exact method of healing, more hurt than good, moſt often accrues to the ſick. There will be no need here to repeat the forms of Purges, Cordials, and of other Medicines, eligantly enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered among many Authors: I will add in few words, ſome chief indications, and Medical Cautions, which ought to be obſerved in the courſe of this Feaver, according to its various times, and divers ſymptoms.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. At the firſt beginning of this Diſeaſe, the buſineſs will be, that the Feaver may be preſently ſuppreſſed; and the inflamation of the heated Sulphur, may be inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: to which, the opening of a Vein doth chiefly conduce; for by this means, the Blood is eventilated, and the heated Particles, too much heaped together, and almoſt ready to be fired, are diſſipated one from another: as when Hey, apt to burn, if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the open Air, its firing is prevented. Beſides, let a ſlender diet be inſtituted, in which nothing Spirituous or Sulphureous ought to be adminiſtred; The Viſcera, and firſt paſſages ſhould be freed from the load of excrementitious matter; wherefore, Clyſters are of neceſſary uſe; ſomtimes alſo Vomits, and gentle Purges; by which, ſomtimes timely and with judgment adminiſtred, the Feaver preſently after the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, is extinguiſhed, the Food of the fire being drawn away. If that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this method the burning ſpreads more abroad, and more and more, dayly ſnatches hold of the Sulphureous Particles of the Blood; it muſt be indeavoured, (as much as may be) that the deflagration proceed gently, without great tumult.</p>
                     <p n="2">2, When the Feaver is augmented, if the Blood be too hot, and diſtends the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels very much, with a vehement and ſtrong Pulſe; if watchings, a Phrenſie, or a pain of the Head cruelly urge, the letting of Blood may be again repeated; Tranſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as much as may be) ſhould be freely procured, wherefore, let the ſick keep in bed, for the moſt part; let the diet be ſparing, of the moſt ſlender Aliments, alſo drink ſmall, and plentiful, that the burning Blood, may be diluted with a more plentiful <hi>Serum:</hi> Clyſters are adminiſtred ſafe enough, and in truth commodiouſly; but Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, whether Cathartics, or Diaphoretics, and which too much exagitate the Blood, are to be ſhunned, with the ſame induſtry, as blaſts of wind to burning houſes: but rather Opiates, and Anodines which fix and bind up the Blood, and Spirits, are to be made uſe of; alſo Juleps, and Decoctions, which refrigerate the burning Viſcera, attemper the Blood, and cheriſh the Spirits, are often to be exhibited: acetous Liquors of Vegetables, or Minerals, alſo putrified Nitre, becauſe they reſtrain the rage of the Blood, and extinguiſh Thirſt, are truly convenient. Hot waters, and Spirits, Cordial, and Bezoartic powders, (ſo long as the Diſeaſe is not malignant) are not to be meddled with. If that the Blood be unequally circulated, and is carried more towards the Head, than the Feet, Epithemas are profitable, of the warm fleſh, or Inwards of Animals, applyed to the ſoles of the Feet.</p>

                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:152521:63"/>3. When the Feaver is at its ſtanding, the motion of Nature is diligently to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, whether it will make a Criſis, or not; Wherefore, nothing raſhly is to be attempted by the Phyſician; the opening a Vein, or ſtrong Purgation, is wholly to be forbid; but after that the Feaveriſh burning is ſomwhat remitted, from the defla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of the Blood, and ſigns of concoction appear in the Urine, if that the motion of Nature be ſlow, a Sweat, or gentle Purge may be admitted; which however are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſafer done, by the Phyſician, when Nature firſt, by a critical motion, hath entered upon the ſecluſion of the Morbific matter. If that all things are crude, and troubled, the Urine yet turbid, without ſediment, or ſeparation of parts, if the ſtrength be languiſhing, the Pulſe weak, if there be no Criſis going before, or only in vain, any evacuation, either by Sweat or Purge, is not to be attempted, without manifeſt danger of life: but it muſt be longer ſtaid for, that the Spirits of the Blood may recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, may by ſome means overcome the excrementitious and aduſt matter, and then by degrees may ſeparate it, and put it forth; in the mean time, the Spirits are to be cheriſhed, with temperate Cordials, the immoderate Effervency of the Blood (if it ſtill be) is to be ſtopped, and its due Fermentation ſuſtained, which in truth is beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by Corals, Pearls, and ſuch kind of powders; which indeed are diſſolved by the Ferments of the Viſcera, and then Ferment with the Blood, and greatly reſtore its weak and wavering motion. In the mean time, (whilſt Nature is labouring) all obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and impediments are to be removed, and eſpecially the proviſion of excrements, heaped up in the firſt paſſages, is to be brought away, by the frequent uſe of Clyſters.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 By what way or method, the ſymptoms chiefly urging, ought to be handled, will not be eaſily preſcribed by certain Rules; becauſe, they themſelves require ſomtimes to be preſently appeaſed, and quieted, and ſomtimes to be quickned forward: and what is ſomthing more, perhaps at another time, they are to be left wholly to Nature. Some of theſe are too oppoſed, with gentle and lenitive Remedies, but others with more ſharp and irritative Phyſic: yet in the mean time, it is a precept to be held in all, that you dilligently wait upon the footſteps of Nature: which if it works wrongfully, its diſorder is to be reduced; if rightly, yet too vehemently, to be bridled: If ſhe works rightly, yet too ſlowly, or more weakly than ſhe ſhould, the buſineſs will be, that her endeavour may be incited, and helped, by the help of Medicine.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In the declination of the Feaver, when after a perfect Criſis, Nature is ſtronger than the Diſeaſe, the buſineſs goes well, nor is there much buſineſs left for a Phyſician: It only remains, to propoſe an exact manner of diet, that the ſick may ſoon recover ſtrength, without fear of relapſing: alſo it is requiſite, to exterminate the Reliques of the Feaveriſh matter, with a light Purgation. About Diet, they often fall on the Rock of relapſing, <hi>viz.</hi> by the too haſty eating of fleſh meats, or more ſtrong Food, the ſick relapſe into the Feaver: for when the Viſcera are weak, and the Aliments (unleſs very ſlender) not eaſily digeſted, and when alſo the diſpoſition of the Blood, is weaker, that it does not aſſimilate the more ſtrong nouriſhing Juice; if any thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate is brought to either, the regiment of Nature is again perverted, and all goes ill. Wherefore, thoſe growing well, ſhould for a long time refrain from fleſh, and when at length they uſe it, it ſhould not be unleſs the Urine ſhall be like that of health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people, and no more troubled by the cold: and then indeed it will be ſafeſt, to begin with broths made of fleſh, and then by degrees, to proceed to more ſtrong Aliments.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When from an imperfect Criſis, things are grown doubtful, and remain yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined; then is the Phyſicians moſt difficult task: The motions and ſtrength of Nature are carefully to be waited on, whether it begins to prevail on the Diſeaſe, or to yield to it: If ſigns of concoction appear, and that there is ſtrength, a gentle evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and only by leiſure, is to be celebrated. In the mean time, the ſymptoms moſt urging, are to be ſuccoured, with convenient Remedies, all impediments to be taken away, and ſtrength is to be ſuſtained (as much as may be) with Cordials, and a right manner of living or diet.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. When from an evil, or no Criſis, all things turn to the worſe, and when the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician almoſt diſpaires of Curing the Diſeaſe, he may predict its event ſuſpected, and much to be feared, But yet, he ought not to truſt to a naked Prognoſtication, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all things elſe, but that as yet, what is in the Medical Art, ſhould be conſulted for Health, tho deſperate: Remedies may be adminiſtred, to the ſymptoms moſt infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting; the Spirits of the Blood almoſt extinct, may be reſtored by Cordials. When we deſpond of Health, life ſhould be prolonged as long as it may, and at leaſt a fair exit procured.</p>

                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:152521:64"/>According to the various types but now deſcribed, of a Putrid Feaver, I might readily add very many Hiſtories of ſick people, and particular obſervations, made about their Cure; for theſe kind of examples are uſually met with in our dayly practice, ſo that they are ſufficient to fill a great Volumn; out of theſe however, with the good leave of the honeſt Reader, I will briefly propoſe ſome few, reſpecting the ſeveral kinds of the aforeſaid Feaver, by which their Doctrine, and Method of healing them, above delivered, may be illuſtrated.</p>
                     <p>A Noble Matron, about fifty years of Age, of a ſlender habit of Body, little ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, indued with a ruddy Complection, when on the fifteenth day of <hi>June,</hi> by reaſon of the Summers heat, ſhe had put on more thin Garments, than ſhe was wont, felt herſelf ill in the Evening; from thence ſhe was diſtempered with a nauſeouſneſs, and oppreſſion of her Stomach, ſhe felt wandring pains, troubling her now in her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, now in her back, very thirſty, yet without any immoderate heat: on the ſecond, and third day, almoſt after the ſame manner, on the fourth day after a Vomit, <hi>Viz.</hi> of the infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> one Ounce given, ſhe caſt forth yellow bile four times, and had three Stools, and ſeemed to be eaſed: the night following, ſhe ſlept ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better: but on the next day, the Feaver being throughly inkindled, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of thirſt, a burning of the Praecordia, and of a pain, now in her ſide, now in her back; preſently blood was taken to eight Ounces, her Urine was of a very deep red, thick, and troubled without any Hypoſtaſis, or ſetling of the Contents, her Pulſe unequal, and often intermitting, the following night without ſleep: on the ſixth day of the Diſeaſe, early in the Morning, a ſmall Sweat broke forth, from whence the heat ſomthing abated, which in the Evening again grew ſtronger: on the ſeventh day, a very acute heat, with thirſt, burning, an inordinate and intermitting Pulſe, as alſo with a mighty reſtleſſneſs, and toſſing of the whole Body troubled her, on the eighth the ſymptoms were ſomwhat more remiſs, alſo in the Urine, ſome marks of an Hypoſtaſis; ſhe took that day poſſet-drink, with Meadow-ſweet boiled in it, and ſweated plentifully; and was cured of her Feaver. All the time of her ſickneſs, for Food they gave only ſmal Beer, Poſſet drink, Barly broth, or Grewel, alſo frequently Clyſters; Drink, and a cooling Julep, they gave her at her pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>This Noble Lady, through tranſpiration being hindred, fell into a Putrid Synochus: the <hi>Effluvia,</hi> wont to be evaporated through the skin, being retained within, (together with the Choler flowing out of the Choleric Veſſels) and fixed to the Viſcera, did overthrow the diſpoſitions of their parts, and eſpecially gave trouble to the Stomach, and raiſed up pains and Convulſions, in the parts filled with Muſcles and Membranes: the Pulſe was unequal, and intermitting, not becauſe of the malignity of the Diſeaſe, as in the Plague, but by reaſon a certain proper diſpoſition of the Heart, by which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, its ferment being not well conſtituted, the Blood growing fervent, is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently equally inkindled, and wholly leaps forth, but a part of the Blood, in flowing in a ſmall, then a greater, and after ſome turns the graateſt proportion, ſtoping for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time, in the Boſoms of the Heart, produces the unequal and intermitting Pulſe. I have known in many others, clearly, the like diſtemper of the Pulſe: to wit, ſo long as they were free from intemperance, the Pulſe was altogether equal, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, but if they were more ſtrongly heated than uſually, by any ſudden paſſion of the mind, or too great agitation of the Body, preſently they were affected with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Pulſe, and between the vibrations or ſtrikings, intermitting perhaps 4, 7, 10, or 20. and as often as they fell into a Feaver, the Pulſe ſhewed it ſelf after this irregular manner. When this habitual irregularity, concerning the Pulſe, was not yet made known to me, by frequent experience, I was wont to ſuſpect ſtill a malignity in the Diſeaſe, and to foretel a fatal event, which hapned otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>On the fifth day, in this ſick perſon, the Feaver, although ſlowly inkindled, came to an augmentation, and from thence paſt through the reſt of the ſtations with a ſwift motion: on the ſixth a light emptying of the aduſt matter, ariſing to a fulneſs, a ſweat being riſen, and ſo a certain remiſſion of the Feaveriſh heat followed: on the ſeventh day, this aduſt matter ariſing to its height of increaſe, made the ſtanding of the Diſeaſe, to which, at length on the eighth day, a plentiful ſweat, with all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to a good Criſis, followed, and perfectly Cured the Feaver: becauſe (as it ought to be) thoſe three things went before this critical evacuation, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt a full and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient deflagration of the Blood, as appeared by the very ſtrong heat, and plainly fiery, continued for three days before: alſo ſecondly, a congeſtion of the aduſt matter to a plenitude, as was collected by the high diſquiet, and toſſing about the preceeding
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:152521:64"/>
and then a certain Pepaſmus or Concoction of the ſame matter, and a begun ſecreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Blood, which a ceaſing of the ſymptoms and ſigns of Concoction in the Urine, ſhewed: wherefore, the Copious ſweat, coming upon ſo laudable a ſign, ſo long as there was no ſuſpition of malignity, portended nothing but good.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of the year 1656, a Gentleman endued with an active habit of Body, without any manifeſt cauſe, (unleſs that being much addicted to ſtudy, he uſed no exerciſe after it) became ill; at firſt he complained, of a nauſeouſneſs and want of Appetite, with a great Headach: on the ſecond day, he was affected, now with a ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, now with heat, ſeveral times reciprocating, beſides, with thirſt, and burning of the Praecordia, with a ſcurfieneſs of the Tongue, and an ingrateful ſavour. On that day, he took ten drams of an Emetick Liquor, by which he Vomited ſeven times, and caſt up a great quantity of yellow bile, and had four Stools; the night following he was unquiet, and almoſt wholly without ſleep, and in which the ſick perſon grew more Feaveriſh, with an increaſed heat: on the third day, when the aforeſaid ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms were grown worſe, he was let Blood to ten Ounces: his Urine was red, thick, and with a copious ſediment; his Pulſe quick, and vehement; at night he ſweat a little, with a ſhort ſleep, but diſturbed: on the following morning, he ſeemed to be a little eaſed: yet in the evening all things grew worſe, with moſt ſtrong wakings, heat, and thirſt: on the fifth day, by a light ſweat, the heat ſomwhat remitted, which yet a little before the evening, returned with its wonted fierceneſs, The night again was wholly without ſleep, with a continual toſſing up and down of his Body: In the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by a little gentle ſweating, he felt a little eaſe; in the evening an encreaſe again of all things more cruelly; the night alſo was very unquiet: about the beginning of the next day, a ſweat, as before ſucceeded, and a little more plentifully: on this day was a manifeſt change towards health; the heat and thirſt was a little leſs vehement; his Urine was leſs red, with ſome Hypoſtaſis; thence, for three days, the Feaver leiſurly declined; yet every night he had a certain fit, but more remiſs than before on the eleventh day, he ſweated more plentifully, and was perfectly Cured: all the time of his ſickneſs, he uſed a moſt ſpare diet, taking truly nothing of Aliment, beſides ſmall Beer, and Poſſet drink made of it; he ſomtimes took drink, and cooling Juleps, of boiled Barly, and diſtilled waters; dayly, if his Belly was not looſe of it ſelf, an emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient Clyſter was adminiſtred: he uſed no other Phyſic beſides, to wit, neither Purge nor Cordial. But the Feaver being allayed, he was twice Purged, and from thence quickly grew well.</p>
                     <p>This Feaver was a Putrid Synochus, as may be conjectured by the ſhivering about the beginning, and then with continual heat, thirſt, watchings, and other ſymptoms grieviouſly infeſting, for many days: but foraſmuch, as its intemperature was exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated every night, it might be called a continued Quotidian: This Diſeaſe, made its firſt aſſault without any evident cauſe, becauſe the Blood being little ventilated, like Wine growing hot of it ſelf, had conceived an ardour, from the exalted Sulphur; the Choler flowing forth from the Choleduct Veſſels, and likewiſe the Purgings of the raging Blood, being poured about inwardly, (as it is wont to do for the moſt part in Feavers) preſently ſtirred up troubles, and diſorders in the firſt paſſages: therefore by reaſon of the excrementitious matter there heaped up, there was procured a depletion, and ſoon after the beginning, a Vomiting: notwithſtanding which evacuation, and likewiſe a more ſtrong Purging of the Belly by Stool, if adminiſtred, the Feaver be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly inkindled, becauſe they too much agitate the Blood, and diſturb greatly the Concoction of the aduſt Feaveriſh matter, for that reaſon bring more damage for the moſt part than benefit to the ſick: The firſt ſtation of this Diſeaſe, <hi>viz,</hi> until the whole Blood was fired, was extended to the third day; and then from thence, when the Blood flaming forth was burthened with aduſt recrements, its greater ebullition, with a frequent endeavour of expulſion by ſweat followed: on the ſeventh day, when the Blood for the greateſt part had flamed forth, and the aduſt recrements, heaped up in its boſom to a fulneſs of ſwelling up, began to be troubleſom, the critical motion was ſtirred up: by which nevertheleſs, that matter not being as yet wholly ſubdued, nor ready for ſeparation, the Diſeaſe was not perfectly Cured; but after another peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, the ſame increaſing, at laſt being ſtirred up, on the eleventh day, brought on that other, and perfectly Curing ſwelling up: in the days between, becauſe, beſides the recrements remaining after the deflagration of the Blood, and reſerved for a Criſis, alſo from the Nutritious Juice not preſently taking fire, but after a peculiar manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, other matter in the boſom of the Blood, apt to a ſwelling up, was gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; therefore, from the continual increaſe, and Flux of this, there hapned to this Feaver continual fits, (ſuch as are wont in Intermitting Feavers) on ſet days, and hours.

ſuffocating Catarrh: For this kind of diſtemper (as alſo the Cough with great ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) ariſes not, for that the watery humor (as is commonly ſaid) falls from the head, into the throat, and lungs; but becauſe the ſerous Latex is poured forth, now from the pneumonic veſſels, immediately into the lungs, now dropping forth from the Arteries opening into the larynx, falls down on the breaſt; on the third day, from the ſame ſerous humor, with a portion of the Blood, being fixed in the ſide, the acute pain aroſe; for the Blood beginning to grow fervent, when as yet it did contain in it ſelf a crude matter, and (as it ſhould ſeem) ſomthing ſour, from the degenerate alible juice, depoſed the ſame, (becauſe it could not caſt it forth of doors by ſweat) by a proper luſtration or purging through the intercoſtal Arteries, into the membrane ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ribs; and there (as it is always wont in a Pluriſie) either by coagulation, (which may be lawfully ſuſpected) or by the ſhutting up of the veſſels, the Blood being intangled with the ſame matter, is ſtopped in its motion; then being increaſed in its bulk, by a new coming ſtill of the Blood, it cauſes a break of the union, and ſo an acute pain. That in this ſick woman, the ſame kind of matter, diſturbing the maſs of Blood, with a portion of it extravaſated, was fixed about the Pleura, it from thence hapned, becauſe the pain urging, the urine was clear, and not full of contents: then, when the veſſels, by reaſon of Phlebotomie, being emptied, they ſupped up again that matter, into its maſs, before exterminated from the Blood, the urine preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came troubled, and again big with contents: The pulſe was unequal, and intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, becauſe of the idiocraſie or proper diſpoſition, which ſhe was wont to have in every intemperature: for when I cured this woman of a Feaver, many years before, her pulſe being unequal, and intermitting, had ſtruck a fear in me, and others, of a ſad preſage, concerning the event of the diſeaſe, which however at that time, (as alſo in this ſickneſs) ceaſed, proſperouſly, without any horrid Symptom.</p>

The night followed, without ſleep, and very unquiet: on the third day, he was again let blood, beſides Liniments, and fomentations were applyed to his ſide; Moreover pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Juleps, and antipleuretick decoctions, being taken inwardly, about night the pain almoſt wholly ceaſed. Then by and by, he was afflicted with a cruel headach, and a vertigo: on the fourth day, a ſtream of Blood fell from his right noſtril, about two ounces, by which the pain of his head clearly ceaſed, and the vertigo; but in the Evening, the pain in the ſide before diſtempered, returned with greater fierceneſs: In the mean time his Pulſe was ſmall, and weak, that when it was conſulted upon, for the letting him blood again, 'twas thought dangerous, leſt his dejected ſtrength would not admit of ſuch a remedy: wherefore, Phlebotomie was performed only, in a very ſmall quantity, and a fomentation, and a Cataplaſme was preſcribed to be diligently applyed to his ſide; beſides twenty drops of the ſpirit of Harts-horn, to be taken in a ſpoonful of Cordial Julep, and the ſame to be repeated continually, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of ſix hours: He ſweat that night very much, and the pain much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, his ſpitting was but little, interſperſed with Blood, which, within a day wholly ceaſed, and the pain alſo leiſurely vaniſhed. The ſick man took twice a day, a ſcruple of the ſame ſpirit of Harts-horn, and within a few days, he grew perfectly well, without relapſing.</p>
                     <p>This Feaver was a ſimple Synochus, ſtir'd up from the evident cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction of the pores: as ſoon as the Blood began to be ſomwhat filled with aduſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and ſo to ſwell up more, the matter, which ſhould have been ſeparated, by reaſon of its peculiar evil, was transferred into the Pleura, and being there fixed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the Blood coming to it, to be coagulated, and therefore to be ſtopped in its circulation, and (when it could not be received by the veins) preſently to be extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated: from hence hapned the acute pain in the ſide, and bloody ſpittle, by and by, after the beginning of this Diſeaſe; then afterwards, the ſame matter being thruſt out of that neſt, which it had got, and being ſupped up again into the maſs of Blood, was fixed in the head; and there inducing the like ſtagnation of the Blood, and (as it is probable) coagulation, cauſed the vertigo, and cruel pain; which nevertheleſs was quickly cured, by the hemorrhage being ariſen, by reaſon of the extravaſated Blood. A part of the morbific matter, being after this manner drawn away, the other part
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:152521:65"/>
reſumed by the Blood, was again conveyed to its uſual neſt, to wit, the ſide before diſtempered; where depoſiting its latex, (to wit, a portion of the Blood) it did coagulate it again, and compelled it to be extravaſated or to flow out of the veſſels: For that pain being renewed on the fourth day, with the bloody ſpittle, from the ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the Blood, too extreamly, and therefore flowing out of the veſſels, would not be brought away; becauſe at that time, the Pulſe was ſmall and weak, with a falling down of the veſſels, that indeed the Blood was thought to have been run all out of the veſſels, for that being coagulated by the morbific matter, (and therefore tho ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed the Arteries, yet not being able to be carried back by the veins) it was ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in its circulation. Upon this, an acute pain followed, becauſe the Blood being heaped together by its frequent approach, and elevated into a Tumor, made a diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the union; alſo, by and by from the beginning, a bloody ſpittle came upon it, becauſe the Blood being reſtrained within, in the Body, ſomwhere in its motion, by reaſon of the moſt tender, and eaſily opening little mouths of the veſſels, ran forth into the Cavities; when to the ſame outwardly extravaſated, by reaſon of a more thick skin, and the mouths of the little veſſels being locked up, no way lay open, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by its being made and ripened into an Impoſthume. The opening of a vein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited in the beginning of the Pleuriſie, becauſe it reſtrained the Blood, ſomwhere hindred in its circuit, from too great effervency; but eſpecially, for that, when the veſſels were by that means greatly emptied, they did again receive, and render fluent, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever humors were before exterminated, and alſo the Blood beginning to ſtagnate in the diſtempered part. Alſo, the remedies helping moſt, about the beginning of this Diſeaſe, were of that ſort, which hinder the coagulation of the Blood, or diſſolve it in the coagulating; ſuch they are, which abound very much with a volatile, or an alcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſate Salt: to wit, ſpirit of Soot, of Blood, Harts-horn, alſo ſpirit and ſalt of Urine, the pouder of the claws and eyes of Crabs, of a Boars tooth, or the Jaw of a Pike, are of known uſe. Among the common people, it is a cuſtom to drink an infuſion of Horſe dung; which medicine indeed, I have known often to have brought help, in deplorable caſes. In the mean time, all acid things whatſoever, becauſe they more coagulate the Blood, and hinder expectoration, are highly hurtful in this Diſeaſe.</p>

                     <p>BEſides the continual Feaver, which is already-deſcribed, and which ariſes from ſome principle of the Blood being too much carried forth, there is another ſpecies of this, which is ſtirred up, by reaſon of the Blood being touched with ſome invenomed Infection, and therefore liable to enter into various coagulations, and corruptions: In which, not only the Spirit and the Sulphur, as in a Putrid Feaver, rage, and compel the Blood to grow immoderately hot, but beſides, the mixture of the Blood is preſently diſſolved, and its liquor goes into parts; and ſo moſt horrid Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, with manifeſt danger of life, are induced in this ſort of diſtemper. Under this rank, we comprehend malignant, and peſtilential Feavers, the Plague, ſmall-Pox, and Meaſles: of which we ſhall ſpeak preſently.</p>
                     <p>Peſtilential Diſeaſes, wander ſo in the dark, and have an unknown original, that their cauſes, and beings are ſeldom explicated, without having a recourſe to occult qualities. By the unanimous conſent of all, the ſtrength, and power of theſe are placed in an invenomed matter; becauſe we perceive, from a peſtilent diſtemper, ſtrength ſuddenly to be overthrown, and life quickly deſtroyed, no otherwiſe than from the dri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>king of Poyſon. And therefore, for the explicating the nature of the peſtilence, it will not be beſides the matter, firſt, to inquire concerning Poyſon in general, and by what means it diſtempers our Bodies, then to ſhew what ſort of Poyſon is ſprinkled in the Plague, and contagious Diſeaſes: which being performed, we will treat parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of the Diſeaſes but now recited.</p>
                     <p>Every thing deſerves the name of Poyſon, which ſtriking into our Body, after an occult manner vehemently hurts the temper, and actions of any part, or of the whole, profligates the Spirits, or perverts their motions, ſolves the mixtures of the Liquors,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:152521:66"/>
and induces Coagulations and Corruptions, deſtroys the functions and ferments of the Viſcera, and ſo ſuddenly and hiddenly brings life into danger, of theſe, which after this manner lie in wait for us, there is a mighty plenty, and very rich proviſion in the nature of things: oftentimes they are inly begotten within our body; outwardly they are abundantly ſupplyed from every Coaſt, and out of every tract of Earth, water and air, theſe daily ariſe out of the diſtinct families of minerals, vegetables, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and ſo mingle themſelves with our food, yea with our medicine, that we may complain with Plinie, <hi>quod non ſit fateri, an rerum natura largius mala, an remedia genue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> That it was not known, whether Nature had begot greater Evils, or Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                     <p>As there is great varieties of Poyſons, ſo, as to their Subjects, and ways of hurting, there is no leſs diverſity of them: for the moſt Poyſons, in their whole ſubſtance are ſaid to be contrary to us, that whatſoever they come to, with a burning force, and like fierce fire, they reduce into aſhes, yet out of theſe, ſome being noted for a peculiar raiſing of hurt, do more endammage one part or ſubſtance than another. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, on which the taint of Poyſon, is next and more immediatly inflicted, are two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; to wit, the animal Spirits, or the ſpirituous ſubtil Liquor flowing in the Brain, and nervous ſtock; and the Blood flowing in the Veſſels, and heart, when the object is carried only to one, or being improportionate, at one to either, that from thence, the diſpoſition of the Liquors, or of the containing parts, is overthrown, whereby the neceſſary functions, for the performing of life and ſenſe, are reſtrained, and this done latently, and as it were unforeſeen, theſe kind of diſtempers, we aſcribe to Poyſon.</p>
                     <p>The nervous bodies, with the animal Spirit, are not invaded wholly after the ſame manner, by every ſort of Poyſons; for they are tormented, now with a Stupor, now with Convulſions, and thoſe of divers kinds, and manners: The bile of a Tarantula cauſes dancing: A power ſent from the Torpedo, by the Angle, or lines of the Net, ſtupifies the hand of the Fiſher. The roots of the wild Parſnip, or the ſeeds of Loli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um or Darnel, being eaten, make men mad: Opium, Mandrakes, Henbane, and the like, cauſe deep, and ſomtimes deadly ſleep. Theſe and many others, chiefly impreſs their Poyſon, on the ſpirituous or animal faculty, without any great perturbation of the Blood, or hurt brought to the heart.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo ſome Poyſons, which moſt of all inſinuate their malignity, to the maſs of Blood; wherefore, from ſome Medicines, there have been produced, a yellow or black Jaundice, ſomtimes a Leproſie, or leprous diſtempers, and ſwellings of the whole body, vapours breaking forth from ſecret hollows of the Earth, alſo from Coals newly inkindled, often ſuffocating the vital Spirits, at once congeal the Blood, and ſtop it in its motion, whereby the flame of life in the heart, could not be continued. How much corruption of the maſs of Blood is imparted from the peſtilent Infection, is perſpicuous to every one, from the ſpots and Whelks, which are as it were the marks of the blaſted Blood.</p>
                     <p>If the hurt, being firſt inflicted to either, <hi>viz.</hi> The regiment of the Heart, or Brain, be more lightly made, it is for the moſt part cured, without any great offence to either; wherefore, Convulſive motions, Stupifaction, Lethargie, Melancholy, Paralytick di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, do not ſeldom begin with a laudable Pulſe, and without an immoderate effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency of the Blood; and then, if the diſtemper does not get ſtrength, leiſurely end, and ceaſe. There are other Poyſons, which often deprave the Blood, and by diſſolving its mixture, corrupt it, in the mean time the animal functions remain whole enough. But if the ferment of the Poyſon be ſtronger, and hath more deeply fixed its roots, preſently the Poyſon is diſperſed, from one Province to the other: for when the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous parts ſwell up, with a virulent juice, a portion of the Poyſon, is carried with the nervous Latex returning through the Lymphatick Veſſels, into the veins, eaſily into the boſom of the Blood, and infects its maſs, with the evil with which it was big: alſo, from the Blood being grievouſly impoyſoned, the juice, by which the nerves are wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, quickly contract the infection; hence mad men are in a Feaver, and thoſe taken with a peſtilent Feaver, are moſt often tormented with a Delirium, or Phrenſie. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe things, we muſt conſider, what the alteration is, or the impreſſion of hurt, which is inflicted from the Poyſon, to the animal Spirit, with the brain and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous appendex; and what alſo, to the Blood, with the Heart, and the annexed Veſſels: tho here, it is not in the power of humane skill or wit, plainly to ſhew, or as it were point out with the finger the manner of its being done; yet we may be able to attain to ſome little knowledge of this thing, by reaſoning, and by comparing it, with other diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the former, we ſhall obſerve, that the ſubtil Liquor, or animal Spirits,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:152521:66"/>
wherewith the Nervous Bodies are blown up, and by whoſe expanſion, ſenſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perform their reciprocal actions, are eaſily perverted from their tenſity, and equal expanſion: for as the Nerves are of a ſoft texture, and the Spirits which abound in them of a very ſubtil ſubſtance, they cannot endure any ſtrong or vehement objects; wherefore when any violent or improportionate thing falls on them, they are often compelled from their expanſion, and excurſion into flight, and a running backward, and not ſeldom into irregularities of motions: wherefore ſudden paſſions of the mind diſtract them, and drive them into Spaſms, and Convulſions; when the Alible Juice, by which they are repaired, is ſupplyed too ſharp, ſour or auſtere, they ſuffer now Palſies, and now contractures: If that ſome object more incongruous, (ſuch as we have affirmed Poyſon to be) ſhould be offered, whoſe Particles are indued with ſuch fierceneſs, or are of ſuch a kind of configuration, that when they grow impetuouſly hot with the Nervous Liquor, they ſhake or loſe here and there its more ſubtil or ſpirituous part, or wholly drive it away, and fix the remaining Liquor either with a ſtyptic force, or by ebullition, force it into inordinate motions; hence of neceſſity, evil di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of the Brain, and Nervous parts ariſe, <hi>viz.</hi> ſomtimes a Convulſion, Tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Shivering, ſomtimes looſnings, or a ſtupefaction, and other ſymptoms of more grievous note. What things after this manner infect the Nervous Juice with Poyſon, are now more thick, and only when they are applyed in a very Corporeal ſubſtance, do inflict their hurt; now they are thin, and being reſolved, even into a vapour or breath, pour forth from a certain little prick, the ferment of Poyſon, through the whole Nervous ſtock. Somtimes the Poyſon of ſome hurtful thing, being eaten, firſt begins its Tragedy in the Ventricle; more often by a naked touch, leaves on the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the Body, a virulent taint, which eaſily and quickly with its ferment, contaminates the Spirits, diſperſed through the whole. The Infection, wherever inflicted, either within or without, is more largely diſperſed from the extremities of the Nerves, by their eaſie paſſage, being from thence brought into conſent of the evil, by the very many little ſhoots of the ſame branch. Often a more light touch of an invenomed thing, by the finger, or extremity of any other member, preſently communicates to the Brain, the received infection, and from thence it is retorted into the whole Body, and the fartheſt members; the reaſon of this is, that both the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Nervous Juice, and of the ſame invenomed infection, are ſo light, and ready for motion, that they paſs through moſt ſwiftly, as the Rays of light through a Diaphanous medium, the whole maſs of one another.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As often as the Blood contracts hurt from ſome Poyſonous thing, the Poyſon is fixed within; either ſlow, and of leſſer activity, which does not preſently betray it ſelf, nor break forth into cruel ſymptoms, till of a long time after, it is ripened by a ſilent fermentation, and hath firſt infected the whole maſs of Blood, as may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in ſome Poyſons, which are ſaid to kill at a diſtance, and not till after ſome months, or years. Or the Poyſons inſpired into the Blood, are imbued with a much more acute ſting, that from their Contagion, the Infection contracted, preſently breaks forth into cruel ſymptoms, and thereupon follows now a Feaveriſh effervency with Vomiting, Thirſt, and burning of the Precordia, now a ſwelling up of the whole Body, a diſcoloration of the skin, oftentimes a breaking forth of whelks, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boes, and frequently alſo a ſudden loſs of all ſtrength, ſo that ſudden death, without tumult, and almoſt inſenſibly ſteals upon one: where by the way it is to be noted, If the Spirits of the Blood, provoked by the enemy, are able to encounter him, and to ſtrive for the victory, this Feaveriſh ebullition of the Blood is ſtirred up from the conflict; but if the Particles of the Poyſon, being far ſtronger, ſuddenly profligate the Spirits of the Blood, and extinguiſh life, preſently the Bloody maſs is corrupted, neither can it be circulated in the Veſſels, nor rightly inkindled in the heart.</p>
                     <p>If it be yet demanded, what mutations, the Blood infected with Poyſon, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes, either in its ſubſtance, or conſiſtency, that, for that reaſon it is rendered unfit for the ſuſtaining of Life? I anſwer after this manner; ſome Poyſons fuſe the Blood, and too much precipitate its ſeroſity, ſuch are Medicines, which by a ſtrong killing Purging, or by a <hi>Profluvium</hi> of Urine, or a diſcoloration, or ſwelling up of the whole Body, or with an eruption of Puſtules, cauſe a very great ſecretion of the ſerous Latex; in the mean time a great ebullition of the maſs of Blood is induced, whereby the Vital Spirits are greatly deſtroyed, the Particles of Salt and Sulphur too much exalted, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and are often ſo roaſted, that a Yellow or Black Jaundies is cauſed.</p>
                     <p>There are Poyſons of another kind, far more dangerous, which congeal the Blood, and by deſtroying its mixture, corrupt it, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt induce a congelation to the Bloody maſs, and then a Putrefaction: for when the Spirits of the Blood, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:152521:67"/>
by the contagion of the Poyſon, are diſſipated, the equal mixture of the Liquor is looſned; wherefore the more thick Particles mutually infold one another, and (like Milk when Rennet is put to it, or growing ſowr of it ſelf) are coagulated apart: hence the Blood curdles in the Veſſels, that it is leſs readily circulated in them: coagulated portions of this, being inwardly diluted, into the boſom of the Heart, are apt to ſtagnate there, and ſo to bring forth frequent ſyncopes, and ſwounings: being carried outwardly, and in the circulating, fixed in the skin, ſomtimes being more plentifully heaped together, they induce a ſuffuſion of blackneſs through the whole, ſomtimes being more ſparingly diſperſed, they cauſe only ſpots, or Purple marks, like black and blew ſtroaks, and other appearances of malignity. But the coagulation of the Blood, quickly diſpoſes it to putrefaction or corruption; as is ſeen in extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated Blood, which is wont to grow ſoon black and putrid. For the Spirit being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled, the Particles of Sulphur and Salt remaining in the Blood, begin to go apart one from another, and to break the bond of the mixture, from whence follows Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things being thus premiſed of Poyſon in general, the reaſon of the method requires that we enter upon the handling of Feavers, which draw their Original, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together from a malignant, and invenomed infection: and as under this title, the Peſt or Plague eaſily obtains the chief place, I will begin with its conſideration, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, I will ſpeak of malignant Feavers, Small-pox, and Meaſels, in order. But yet, before I ſhall propoſe its definition, I will briefly inquire, of the peſtiferous Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, what its diſpoſition and Nature may be; alſo, from whence it may be born, and laſtly, by what means it is propagated into others, by contagion.</p>
                     <p>For the expreſſing the Nature of the Plague, Authors are wont to chooſe ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed Bodies, and from their names to frame an Elogy of this moſt wicked Diſeaſe; wherefore in the definition of the peſt, are commonly recounted the Nepelline, Aco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nital, and Arſenical Poyſon: the Lethiferous force of which however, as it conſiſts in a very thick matter, and does not exert or put forth itſelf but by a Corporal contact, doth not truly imitate the eſſence of the Peſtilential Diſeaſe: for this is founded in a Spiritual and Vaporous infection, by which its <hi>Effluvia</hi> being every way diffuſed, ſo potently unfold themſelves, that out of the beſt ſeminary or ſeed plot, they quickly propagate a fruitful Crop of death and deſtruction, By reaſon of its notable activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, this infection may deſerve to be called, as it were a certain quinteſſence of Poyſon; the very agil and ſubtil Particles of this, do penetrate all Bodies, and inſpire them with its ferment: for either being diſperſed through the Air, or hid in a certain tender or cheriſhing neſt, tho they ſtrike againſt the human Body but lightly, and as it were through a Caſement, they eaſily ſubdue it; for both the Animal Spirits, and thoſe of the blood, they quickly infect, and by that means, ſhortly pour forth the Venomous taint, into all the members.</p>
                     <p>When a Peſtilential Breath or Vapour, hath invaded any one, and that Poyſon hath firſt laid hold on the Animal Spirits, or thoſe of the Blood, or both of them at once, (as hath been already ſaid of Poyſons) the taint is quickly derived from the ſubtil and more thin ſubſtance of theſe, into a more thick matter: becauſe it quickly ferments the whole maſs of Blood, or of the Nervous Juice, and the excrementitious humors, every where abounding, and from thence is deduced into the ſolid parts, and fixes the evil in them. If this Diſeaſe, firſt poſſeſſes the Animal Spirits, preſently the hurt is communicated to the Brain, and the Nervous ſtock, and eſpecially to the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, forthwith it impoyſons the humour growing in theſe; looſens its mixture, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the regular motion, and renderr it wholly incongruous, and infeſtous to the more tender ſubſtance of the containing parts: by and by from thence, Cramps and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive motions, cruel Vomitings, pains of the Heart, alſo Phrenſies, deliriums, or pertinacious watchings, are ſtirred up, about the firſt aſſault of the Diſeaſe: when in the mean time, the infection not being yet diſperſed through the Blood, the ſick are not Feaveriſh, nor are troubled with inordinate Pulſe, or Syncope, or appearances of marks; which ſymptoms however ariſe afterwards, as ſoon as the Blood is infected. If when the Spirits of the Blood are firſt poſſeſſed, with the impoyſoned infection, either drawn in with the Air, or attracted through the pores, its ferment is preſently diſſipated through the whole maſs of the Blood, the infeſted portions immediately begin to be looſned from their equal mixture, to go into parts, and to be coagulated, and the ſame, being delated, into the boſom of the Heart, are wont there to ſtagnate, and ſo to induce a Syncopy, Swoonings, and often ſudden Death; alſo being carried outwardly, fixed about the skin, to cauſe Buboes, inflamed riſings, and other marks of Poyſon; in the mean time, the ſick appear well in mind, nor are they troubled with Delirium
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:152521:67"/>
nor Convulſive motions. If that from a more ſtrong cauſe, the hurt is inflicted to both parts at once, the courſe of the Diſeaſe is performed with a more horrid proviſion of ſymptoms, and eſpecially with a Syncopy, and Phrenſie at once infeſting.</p>
                     <p>As to what appertains to its riſe; when the Plague firſt ariſes in any Region or Country, there is attributed a twofold cauſe of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Primary or Metaphyſical, alſo Secondary or Natural, ſubordinate to that: The very Heathens did acknowledg this Diſeaſe, wherever it raged, ſent firſt of all from God, for the caſtigation of the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of men, and therefore for its extirpation, they equally made uſe of Prayers and Sacrifices as of Medicines. As to what belongs to the Natutal cauſe, there are divers opinions. Some will, that the Peſtilence newly ariſen, be derived from the Heavens, and influences of the Stars only: on the contrary, others have affirmed it only to ariſe from the internal putrefaction of the humors of our Body: but theſe endeavour to deduce the cauſe of this ſickneſs too far off, and theſe more near than it ought. We will walk in the middle way, and what Reaſon perſuades, and what very many Authors aſſert, we will place the chief and firſt ſeminary or ſeed plot of this Poyſon, in the Air; becauſe, it ſeems conſonant to Reaſon, that from the ſame Fountain, from which the common food of life is had, the beginnings of death, no leſs diffuſive, are to be ſought. There is the ſame neceſſity for our breathing in the Air, as of Fiſhes living in the Water; wherefore, as to waters infected by Poyſon, the murrain of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes dying in heaps is aſcribed; ſo men dying of an Epidemical ſlaughter, without any manifeſt cauſe, nothing could kill, beſides the infection of the commonly inſpired Air.</p>
                     <p>For the Air, which we neceſſarily draw in for the continuance of Life, conſiſts of an heap of vapors and fumes, which are perpetually breathed forth from the Earth; in which the exhalations of Salt and Sulphur, being mingled with the atomical va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous little Bodies, conſtitute here as it were a thick cloud: the motions of theſe are ſwift and unquiet, they are of a manifold figure, and very much diverſe, wherefore ſome continually meet againſt others, and according to their various configurations, they cohere with theſe, and are mutually combined one with another, and from thoſe they are driven, and fly away: from hence the reaſons of the Sympathy and Antipathy of every thing, depend. From the diverſe agitations of theſe kind of Atoms, near the ſuperficies of the Earth, this or that tract of the Air, enters into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe alterations, by which, Bodies, chiefly the living are variouſly affected: becauſe the inteſtine motion, of the Particles of every Animal, depends very much upon the motion and temper of the Particles of the Air: foraſmuch as theſe perpetually exagitate thoſe, raiſe up thoſe lying aſleep, repair the loſs of thoſe flying away, ſhake the vital flame with their Nitroſity, and ſupply it with a Nitrous-Sulphureous Food, eventilates it being inkindled by continual turns of acceſs and receſs, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away the Soot and Fumes. So long as an apt contemperation happens in either, for motion and configuration, living Creatures injoy perfect health and life; but if the little Bodies ſwiming in the Air, be of that ſort of figure and power, that are plainly adverſe to the Spirits implanted in living Creatures, they looſe the mixtures of theſe, from the reſt, from whoſe Elements they are collected, and pervert their motions; hence the diſpoſitions of things are deſtroyed, life profligated, and, the ſame being ſcarce extinct, the Bodies undergoe putrefaction; hence the tops of Trees, or of Corn, being ſtruck with a blaſt, ſuddenly grow dry or wither; hence among Cattel, the murrain often rages, which kills at once whole Flocks; by reaſon of this kind of cauſe, the Seeds of the Peſtilence firſt put themſelves forth, and attempt the ſlaughter of human kind: for as invenomed Bodies in the bowels of the Earth or concreted on its ſuperficies, produce the Arſenical or Aconital mixtures, ſo theſe being even reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into vapour, and heaped together in the Air, create moſt pernitious Airs, from which Malignant and Peſtilential Diſeaſes ariſe; the infection, which after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Contaminates the Air, the moſt ingenious <hi>Diemerbrochius,</hi> a ſearcher of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, contends, that is only ſent (as the wrath of angry <hi>Apollo</hi>) immediately from the angry right hand of God: but this were to multiply without any pretext of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity (I will not ſay beings but) miracles, and in every Plague to aſſert a Creation of new ſubſtance; when in the mean time, the virulent product of Minerals and Vegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, which dayly appear, and of as quite adverſe Nature to us, as the Plague, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifie, that there lives hid in the Bowels of the Earth, plenty of invenomed mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſufficiently fitted for this buſineſs. For the little Bodys, which being roled about with earthy matter, do conſtitute the Poyſonous mixtures in the boſom of the Earth, the ſame being reſolved into vapours, will be no leſs hurtful afterwards, and impreſs a peſtiferous blaſt to the Air, which they wander through: wherefore, by the leave
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:152521:68"/>
of ſo Learned a man, I ſhould ſay, that it ſeems not improbable, that the things which firſt of all affix the ſeed plot of the Peſtilence, to any tract of Air, be the Poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <hi>Effluvia</hi> of fierce Salts and Sulphurs, and (by the Divine Will inſtigating) breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth from the bowels of the Earth; which ſomtimes, being a long time before ſhut up, are leiſurely exhaled out of Dens and Caverns; ſomtimes by reaſon of the motion of the Earth, or Earthquake, or a gaping of the Earth, they break forth in heaps; alſo, of the ſame kind, are thoſe which ordinarily are breathed forth from the filth of Souldiers in their naſty Camps; or from unburied Carcaſes; or from places, beſet with ſtanding and ſtinking Mud: but the little Bodies after this manner exhaled, obtain their wonderful height, properties, and abilities, by a long putrefaction, that therefore they are incongruous, and heterogeneous to all others whatſoever, and ſo being received into the Air, ferment it (as it were a maſs of Liquor) and pervert it from a wholſom and benign, into a moſt pernicious and wicked Nature.</p>
                     <p>Some Bodies more eaſily, others not ſo readily receive the malignant tincture of the Peſtilent Air. Thoſe who by reaſon of ill feeding are full of evil humors, and who by reaſon of fulneſs, have their Blood ſtuffed with firable Sulphur, receive the Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Poyſon, by the leſt blaſt of the invenomed Air, eſpecially if fear or ſadneſs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, which convey inwardly, and lead to the Heart, as it were by a certain attraction the moſt light darts of the contagion. On the contrary, thoſe who have their Viſcera clean, and the maſs of Blood well tempered, and are indued with a ſtrong, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs mind, do not ſo eaſily receive this infection, and ſomtimes exterminate it ſoon, being received.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the beginning and divulgation of the Peſtilence, according to its firſt Fountains, and from thence the ſtream of the infected Air being deduced: it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for us to ſpeak concerning its propagation by contagion, foraſmuch as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, as it were extraduce from ſome and ſo to others.</p>
                     <p>We underſtand by Contagion, that force or action, by which any diſtemper reſiding in one Body, excites its like in another. But as this may happen, either immediately by contact, as when any one lying in the ſame bed with another, taken with the Plague, or mediately, and at a diſtance, as when it happens that the infection is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from one houſe to others remote, or alſo if the Plague come upon any one, after many days or months, perhaps years handling a Garment, or houſe-hold ſtuff, brought from an infected houſe: therefore that the Nature of the Contagion, and its diverſe modes may be plainly made known, we will firſt weigh what that is, which ſtreams from an infected Body. Secondly, how it bears it ſelf through the Medium of its paſſage. Thirdly, by what means it begets a diſtemper like it ſelf, in another Body.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That from every Body, altho of a more fixt Nature, <hi>Effluvia</hi> of Atoms conſtantly fly away, and run forth, which round about conſtitute as it were a Cloud or Halos, and as it were cloath it, like the down of a Peach, is ſo much received among the more ſound Philoſophers, that nothing can be more. But by how much the more any thing conſiſts of active Particles, by ſo much the more, it ſends from it ſelf, little Bodies of more remarkable virtue and energy. Hence the <hi>Effluvia</hi> which fall from Ambers, are able to move other Bodies from their place: emanations proceed from Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous things, which fill the whole neighbourhood with odors. And ſo when the Peſtilential venom, as hath been already ſaid, is from hence any where fixed, and tho in the ſmalleſt bulk, is of great efficacy and operation, there is a neceſſity, that ſome emanations, proceed from the Bodies imbued with it, which refer the nature or diſpoſition of the ſame Poyſon and malignity, and diffuſe them on every ſide according to its ſphear of activity. But when theſe little Bodies, which retain the contagion of the Peſtilence, as they ſtream from one Body, are not preſently received by another, we ſhall inquire, how they carry themſelves, in reſpect of their paſſage, through the medium.</p>
                     <p>Where we ſhall preſently meet with a difference in thoſe, from many others, for that the <hi>Effluvia,</hi> which ordinarily evaporate, do not long retain the Nature or Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Body, from which they flow, but either vaniſh into Air, or being impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to other Bodies, are aſſimilated to them: but thoſe Particles, which fall from a Peſtilential Infection, are not eaſily ſupped up by the Air, or any other Body, ſo as they may be wholly deſtroyed; but among the various confuſions of Atoms, and the daſhings of other Bodies, they keep themſelves untouched, For this untamed Poyſon remains ſtill the ſame almoſt, and not to be overcome by others, and tho it conſiſts of never ſo little heap of Atoms, will not preſently vaniſh; but with its ferment, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bues the next little Bodies, and ſo acquires new forces, and gains ſtrength by going; from whence it lurks a long while in ſome neſt, and after a long time, when it aſſaults
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:152521:68"/>
a convenient ſubject, puts forth it ſelf, and imparting the taint of its Poyſon to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, raiſes up again the Diſeaſe of the Peſtilence anew, which ſeemed before to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded, and tho from the ſmalleſt ſeminary, ſprinkles far and near its deadly Poyſon.</p>
                     <p>For the Peſt, brings forth ſuch moſt ſure ſigns of its contagion, that ſome Authors contend, that for this reaſon it only continues among Mortals, and doth never ſpring up anew, but is only conſerved from its neſt, and carried from thence, from one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to another. Hiſtories relate, that the ſeeds of this have lain aſleep for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years, in ſome Garment or Bedcloaths, and that afterwards, they being ſtirred, it hath appeared, and hath ſtirred up anew the Diſeaſe of the Peſtilence, increaſing with a mighty ſlaughter of men. When by reaſon of the tinder, or cheriſhing neſt, the Plague is propagated after this manner, at a diſtance, the invenomed little Bodies, which remain in the infection, being moved, preſently leap out, and unfold its Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon every way, as it were by a certain irradiation: if that they ſtrike againſt an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body, preſently they lay hold on the Spirits, and are by their Vehicle conveyed inwardly, and then by an eaſie labour, they infect the Blood and Humors, whereſoever flowing in the Veſſels, with their ferment, and quickly bring to them coagulations and putrefaction. And after this manner, through the moſt ſubtil <hi>Effluvia,</hi> is made as it were a certain tranſmigration of the Peſtilential Diſeaſe, even as when a ſhoot being cut off from ſome Tree, and laid up for a time, and afterwards ingrafted to another Trunk, tho from the ſmalleſt bud, it is able to produce a Tree of the ſame Kind and Nature.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the Plague.</head>
                     <p>THus far we have diſcourſed of Poyſon in general, alſo of the Peſtilence, its beginning and propagation by contagion: it now remains, that we expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the deſcription of the Plague, its Nature, according to its accidents, and ſymptoms, moſt worthy of note; then ſome things ſhall be added, which belong to its Cure.</p>
                     <p>The Plague may be deſcribed after this manner, that it is an Epidemical Diſeaſe, Contagious, highly infeſtous to human kind; taking its beginning from an invenomed Infection, received firſt by the Air, and then propagated by Contagion; which having hiddenly and largely ſet upon men, cauſes extinctious of the Spirits, coagulations of the Blood, blaſtings, mortifications or deadneſſes of the ſolid parts, and with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of whelks, buboes, or carbuncles, as alſo with the horrid proviſion of other ſymptoms, brings the ſick in danger of life.</p>
                     <p>Altho the Plague be one kind of Diſeaſe, and its ſpecifical differences, or eſſential are not found, yet by reaſon of the divers kinds of accidents, which come upon it, ſome diverſities and irregularities of it are obſerved, which ſomthing vary the type of the Diſeaſe, tho they change not the ſpecies. For firſt this diſtemper ſomtimes is more univerſal that it rages every where through many Vilages and Cities at once; but ſomtimes it is circumſcribed in narrower bounds, and only threatens one Region or Tract of Land. Secondly, ſomtimes the Plague comes ſimple, and unmixt with other Diſeaſes, wherefore privily, and as it were by ſurpriſe, almoſt without a Feaver, or vehemency of ſymptoms, brings a ſecret killing of the ſick. Somtimes it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, with a number of other Diſeaſes, that the buſineſs is carried with tumult and frequent skirmiſhing between Nature and Death. Thirdly, the degree of malignity conſtitutes a great difference; for the Plague in ſome places, and times is much more mild, that many of the ſick eſcape; ſomtimes it is highly mortal, that moſt taken are killed, and that ſcarce one of an hundred recovers.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe this Diſeaſe hides its weapons, and coming on men unawares, kills them ſuddenly, therefore it ſhall be our work, that by ſome ſigns, as it were watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men planted, we may know the Clandeſtine coming of this enemy, altho we are not able to foreſee it from afar. Very many ſigns happen, which foretel ſhortly a Plague about to come: to wit, if the year keeps not its Temper, but has immoderate, and very unſeaſonable exceſſes, either of heat or cold, or of dryneſs or wet; if the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:152521:69"/>
ſmall-pox or Meaſles, do every where rage; if Boils or Buboes, accompany reigning Feavers. Beſides, Aſtrologers are wont, from the Aſpects of the Stars, or appearances of Comets, to predict the approaching Plague, but this ought rather to be called a vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, than a certain foreknowledge. From a preceeding Famine, a moſt certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage may be taken, of a Plague to follow, as in the Adage-<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. The Plague comes with the Famine. For the like Conſtitution of the year, which for the moſt part, by reaſon of the Corn being blaſted, brings ſcarcity, is apt alſo to produce the Plague: alſo, an evil way of feeding which people in dearths uſe, eating all unwholſom things, without choice, diſpoſes their Bodies, to the more eaſie receiving the Infection. Yea, alſo earth-quakes freſh openings of Caverns, and ſecret Vaults, by the gaping of the Ground, by reaſon of the eruptions of malignant and impoyſoned Airs, often give beginning to the Peſtilence. For indeed, as there is need of great diligence, to foreſee, as it were from a watch-Tower, the approaching Plague, ſo there is no leſs need of care and diligence, to conſider, or take notice of the ſame, being freſh riſen, and the ſhooting of its firſt darts: For oftentimes, being too ſolicitous, we dread vulgar Feavers, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance they end in death, for this Diſeaſe; and ſomtimes being too ſecure, contemning the Peſtilence, by reaſon of its Symptoms, like to a common Feaver, we apprehend not out danger, till too late; wherefore, for the more full knowledge of this Diſeaſe, we will ſubjoyn its Signs and Symptoms both common, and Pathognomic or peculiar, and briefly deſcribe their cauſes, means, and manner of being done.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the ſigns already delivered, which by a certain demonſtration <hi>à priori</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, bring a ſuſpicion of the Plague about to come, there are others, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of which, plainly ſhew its preſence, in the ſick body: of theſe, ſome are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Plague, with a Putrid Feaver, ſome are more proper to this diſtemper. For the impreſſion of the Peſtilence, moſt often ſtirs up an effervency of the Blood, and ſo has frequently a Feaver joyned with it, that among ſome, in the definition of the Plague, it hath the place of a kind of Feaver; wherefore, by reaſon of the ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, and the hurt brought to the Viſcera, preſently there follows, a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot, a ſpontaneous wearineſs, thirſt, a burning of the precordia, often great Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, pains of the Heart, torments of the Inteſtines, a ſcurfineſs of the Tongue, or a blackneſs, a pain of the head, watchings, Phrenſie, palpitation of the Heart, ſwooning, and ſudden loſs of ſtrength: tho Feavers are moſt often beſet, with theſe kind of Symptoms, yet if at the ſame time, the Plague hath ſpread in the neighbourhood, and a fear of it hath poſſeſſed the minds of men, hence a greater ſuſpition of this evil is cauſed, eſpecially, becauſe, whilſt the Peſtilence reigns, other Diſeaſes in any one, leave their proper Nature, and change into it: wherefore, if there happens to the diſtempers but now recited, a Communication of the ſame ſickneſs to many, and a frequency of Burials, that it becomes every where very deadly, and ſpreads largely even by conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and if beſides, Buboes, Carbuncles, Spots, or other marks of the peſtiferous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection appear, the buſineſs is put without doubt, and we may with no leſs faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it the Peſtilence, than when we ſee an houſe flaming, with fire breaking through the Raftures, we cry out Fire. But becauſe here is mention made of Buboes, Carbuncles, and of other Symptoms, (of which we have already ſpoken, where we treated of Putrid Feavers) it remains, that we briefly touch the cauſes of them, and the manner of their being made: They are theſe: A Carbuncle, a Bubo, Whelks, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations, and malignant Puſtles.</p>
                     <p>Concerning theſe in common, we ſay, that they are all produced of the Blood, and nervous juice, touched with the peſtiferous Poyſon, and coagulated in parts, in their circuit, and diſtempered variouſly with putrefaction; foraſmuch as the Spirits, reſiding in either Liquor, eſpecially in the Blood, are no ſooner profligated, by the blaſt of this malignant Diſeaſe, but a coagulation is induced to the remaining Liquor, even as milk growing ſour, or when ſome acid juice is poured to it; wherefore, portions of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more grievouſly touched with the Poyſon, they ſoon curdle or grow into gobbets, and ſuffer corruption with blackneſs, like Blood out of the Veſſels; from whence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently they hinder the motion of the reſt of the Blood in the Veſſels, and in the Heart, and by means of its ferment, more coagulate it; but whatſoever by congelation grows into curdled gobbets, unleſs it be preſently caſt out of doors, cauſes death quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by reſtraining the circulation of the Blood; and being thruſt forth outwardly, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſuperficies of the body, ir is ſtopped in its motion, between the narrow wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Veſſels; and being wholly deſtitute either of Spirit, or being ſtruck by a blaſting, produces its deadneſs, black and blew ſpots, and black or purple marks; or, by reaſon of the Salt and Sulphur, being exalted, by the peſtilential ferment, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting new things, grow together into tumors of a various kind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:152521:69"/>A Carbuncle, or Fiery Inflamation, is a fiery Tumor, with moſt ſharp and burning Puſtules round about it, and infeſting the ſick, with an acute pain; which ariſing in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious places ſeverally, will not be ripened, but creeping more abroad on the ſuperficies, burns the skin, and at length ſhakes off the lobes, or gobbets of its Corruption, and leaves an hollow ulcer, as if burnt by an Eſcharotick or burning Plaſter.</p>
                     <p>The generation of Plague-ſores, ſeem to be made after this manner, when Poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous infections do ſtrike into the Blood, in its own nature torrid, portions of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed, are fixed in the ſuperficies of the Body; and in that place, becauſe the motion of the Blood is a little hindred, a tumour at firſt ſmall, is induced; which afterwards, by a malignant ferment, unfolding it ſelf more largely, being leiſurely increaſed, creeps into the neighbouring part: A ſuppuration follows not, becauſe the matter being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaſated, and ſtagnating, is not concocted and digeſted by a gentle heat, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the particles of the outrageous Sulphur, together with the carried forth Salt, being heaped up in theſe Tumors, and becauſe of the ſtagnation, they being preſently looſened from the mixture, a burning is excited, as if a Cautery were affixed to the part: pieces and lobes of skins, eaten as it were from a covered Eſchar, fall off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Corroſive venom, impacted in the Muſcles, gnaws not only to the ſuperficies, but thoſe that lie tranſvers through the whole ſubſtance; wherefore, before all the fleſh is conſumed, with the membranes, in which the eaten pieces were invalved, ſome piece, as it were cut off from the reſt falls away. A Carbuncle, oftentimes but one, oftentimes more ariſe: ſomtimes they are alone, ſomtimes they are accompanied with a Bubo.</p>
                     <p>A peſtilent Bubo ſprings forth, only in glandulous places, into whoſe ſubſtance goes, not only the Blood congealed by the Poyſon, and carried through the Arteries, but the nervous juice heaped up there, and carried back into the Veins. Becauſe this Tumor happens from leſs torrid juices, and in part more frigid, therefore it partakes of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration. For the matter being leiſurely heaped together, when (by reaſon of the ſtagnation, the vital Spirit being departed) it had loſt the form of Blood, it was by a long concoction converted into matter, from the particles of Salt and Sulphur exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and reſtrained in the Tumor. But that theſe Tumors only happen in the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulas, the reaſon is, not that by the deſtination of Nature, the neſt or tinder of the Diſeaſe, is carried to theſe parts, but as the particles of the virulent infection, abound every where in the Blood, and nervous juice, they are more readily gathered together, as in a common Family, and where the Blood being dilated to the extream parts of the Arteries; and is ſo not readily received, and carried back by the veins, and alſo the alible juice, to be carried back from the nerves, into the veins, is depoſed: either of theſe, as it appears clearly, by late obſervations of Anatomiſts, and by experience, are made or done about the Glandulas; wherefore, when in theſe parts, either humors, being ſtuffed with the peſtilent ſeeds of the contagion, come together at once, as it were the neſt of the malignity, becauſe of the virulency here depoſed from either, is blown up.</p>
                     <p>Whelks, fiery inflamations, and purple ſpots, in reſpect of the venom, are of the ſame ſtuff, as the Tumors but now deſcribed: but in theſe, the product of the viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, conſiſts in a leſſer ſubſtance, yet with greater danger, by reaſon of the ſeeds of the Poyſon, being more diſperſed: more ſmall portions of the coagulated Blood being fixed in the skin, conſtitute theſe leſſer appearances, wherefore, out of theſe, ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing increaſed, are ripened into little itching bliſters: others, by reaſon of a certain blaſting, or deadneſs of the corrupted Blood, grow into black and blew, and purple Spots.</p>
                     <p>Altho the Plague, by reaſon of its ſudden, ſecret, and very ſwift aſſault upon ſick people, hardly gives time or place, for a prognoſtick, and when this Diſeaſe, by reaſon of the occult manner of hurting, contains in it ſelf nothing that is not ſuſpected, yet there are ſome ſigns, that appear in its courſe, by which we are wont to foretel, either Life or Death. The buſineſs is then deſperate, if the Diſeaſe paſs preſently into an Epidemical diſtemper, and makes violent aſſaults; if that bleeding, or only a ſmall ſweat follows, in the beginning of the Diſeaſe; if the Urine be thick and troubled, the Pulſe unequal, and weak; if a Convulſion, or a Phrenſie preſently follow; if the Vomits, or Stools are blewiſh, black, or highly ſtinking; if the Whelks at firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a redneſs, afterwards a blewneſs; if the Carbuncles are many; if the Buboes at firſt ſwelling up, diſappear; if ſtrength be ſuddenly loſt, the face horrid, or grows black and blew; if with a ſhivering of the outward parts, there be an heat of the bowels, eſpecially if theſe, or many of them happen in a body full of ill humors, or in an unwholſom ſeaſon. On the contrary, the ſick may be bid to be of good chear, if the condition of the Peſtilence be lighter, and leſs deadly; if the Diſeaſe happens in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:152521:70"/>
a robuſt and healthful body, with a ſtrong mind; if remedies may be timely had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Diſeaſe hath poſſeſſed the whole maſs of Blood. Alſo, if with a continuance of ſtrength, high and equal Pulſe, a ſuppuration of the Buboes, and a large profuſion of matter, with the abſence of more horrid Symptoms, the courſe of the Diſeaſe is performed: In the mean time, altho here we may hope all good, yet we are not to be ſecure, becauſe, ſomtimes the ſnares of life, are laid privily, with the laudable appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſigns, and we ſuffer moſt grievouſly as from a reconciled Enemy, whoſe fierce threatnings we ſeemed to have ſhun'd.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the curing of very many ſickneſſes, the buſineſs is chiefly committed to Nature, to whoſe neceſſity, Phyſick is the Midwife: and the office, and ſcience of a Phyſician, chiefly is buſied in theſe, that occaſions of giving convenient aids, to this labouring, be attended, but the Plague hath this peculiar, that its cure is not at all to be left to Nature, but that it is to be endeavoured any way, by remedies gathered from Art. Nor are we to be ſolicitous of a more opportune, or as it were a gentler time, but Medicines are moſt quickly to be prepared, and we muſt not ſtay for them ſome hours, no nor minutes. But becauſe, whilſt the Peſtilence reigns, there is no leſs need of care, that the Contagion may be driven far away, than that the Diſeaſe being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed may be cured, therefore, a double task is incumbent on the Phyſician, to wit, that he looks to the prevention of this malignant Diſeaſe, as well as to the cure. To preſcribe a method for both theſe, had been a work of too much tediouſneſs, and to have given you a diſh a thouſand times dreſſed by Authors, wherefore, we will only touch lightly here, ſome chief Indications, and haſt to other things.</p>
                     <p>Preventive cautions, either reſpect the Republique, and belong to the Magiſtrate, or private perſons, to whom it ſhould be taught, what is to be done by all men, when the Plague is feared.</p>
                     <p>The publique care in the time of the Plague, conſiſts chiefly in theſe, that Divine worſhip be truly obſerved, that all neſts of Putrefaction be cut off, that filths, Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hils, and all ſtinking things may be removed out of the Streets, and all occaſion of the Contagion diligently avoided, and that an wholſom means of living be conſtantly obſerved by the Citizens. For which end, the uſe of fruits, and of other unwholſom things ſhould be interdicted: that poor people, who have not plenty or choice of food, ſhould be provided for, at the publique charge: If ſtill the Peſtilence begins to ſpread, the empoyſoned force of the Air ſhould be corrected, as much as may be, which may be beſt done, by the frequent burning of Sulphureous things; the infected ſhould be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the ſound, and the dead Carcaſes, and houſhold-ſtuff ſhould be avoided; and laſtly, that able and fit Phyſicians, and Miniſters be provided for the uſe of the ſound, and the neceſſities of the ſick.</p>
                     <p>The preventive means of a private perſon, is wont to be concluded in theſe three things, <hi>viz.</hi> Diet, Phyſick, and Chirurgery. Diet reſpects the ſix nonnatural things, among which, of the greateſt moment are, the Air and paſſions of the mind: as to the reſt, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his precept may ſuffice, <hi>viz.</hi> Labour, Meat, Drink, Sleep, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> ſhould be taken moderately. The Peſtilent Air ſhould be avoided, by going into ſome other place; or corrected by the well burning of Sulphureous things, or whilſt we breath it ſhould be cured by fumigations and ſweet ſmells, often carried near the noſtrils. As to the paſſions of the minds, fear, and ſadneſs, whilſt the Peſtilence rages, are as it were another Plague; for in theſe, the ſeeds of the envenomed Contagion, which are placed in the ſuperficies of the Body, as it were on the edge of a whirlpool, are ſnatched inwardly, by a certain force, and carried to the Heart; wherefore, tis a moſt excellent Antidote, to be of a chearful and confident mind. I have known many, who (as <hi>Helmont</hi> was wont to ſay) by fortifying the Archeus, with Wine and confidence, never uſed any other Poyſon-reſiſting Medicines, and remained without any hurt of the Contagion among the infected: and on the contrary, ſome ſtruck with fear, when they have dwelt far from all Contagion, have drank in the ſeeds of the Peſtilence, as if they were derived from the Stars.</p>
                     <p>Among the Chirurgical things, to be adminiſtred for preſervation ſake, are wont to be commended, the opening of a Vein, Cauteries, and Amulets. Where there is a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with a great ſwelling up of the Blood; or in thoſe who conſtantly, by long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>om are wont to be let Blood, it is convenient to open a Vein: For the leſs the Blood grows hot, and is circulated without Tumult, in the Veſſels, it will be ſo much the longer, ere it be contaminated, by the peſtiferous Diſeaſe. Iſſues made by Cauteries, are ſo much uſed, almoſt by the ſuffrage of all, for preſervation ſake againſt the Plague, that tis become the moſt common receipt: For theſe by a conſtant tranſmiſſion pour forth the aſſiduous coming of the ſuperfluous and excrementitious matter; and if
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:152521:70"/>
that the infections of the Peſtilence be admitted inwardly, they are caſt forth of doors, at theſe open ports.</p>
                     <p>Amulets, hung about the neck, or born on the wriſts, are believed to have a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful force againſt the Peſtilence; of theſe, among ſome, of the greateſt eſteem, are ſuch as are made out of Arſnick, quick-ſilver, the pouder of Toads, and other Poyſons. That the ſame in this caſe may be profitable, beſides the obſervations of Phyſicians this reaſon may ſeem to perſuade ſomthing. The <hi>Effluvia,</hi> or atomical little bodies, emerging now from theſe bodies, now reſiding upon theſe, are before affirmed to fly about through the whole Region of the Air; theſe, as they are diverſly figured, ſome of them eaſily cohere with others, but if they ſtrike againſt ſome of another form, they oppoſe and overturn them: hence, the particles of the peſtilent Infection, which are adverſe to our Spirits, excellently agree with thoſe little bodies of Poyſon placed near, and are readily fixed to them: wherefore, the Amulets made of Poyſon do this, <hi>viz.</hi> They receive the ſeeds of the Peſtilence meeting us, into themſelves, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the likeneſs of parts; alſo, by alluring the ſame from our bodies, into their embraces, they in ſome meaſure, free the infected from the infection.</p>
                     <p>The Medicinal prevention hath a twofold ſcope: Firſt, that the aſſiduous coming of the excrementitious matter or humors be taken away by a gentle purging, as often as there is need: Secondly, that by the daily taking Poyſon-reſiſting Medicines, our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and Body may be fortified againſt the aſſault of the Poyſon: By the former, the Food and cheriſhers, of which encreaſe putrefaction brought in by the Poyſon are drawn away; by the latter, the firſt inkindling of the peſtiferous Infection, as it were a deadly fire, is inhibited. Alexipharmies or Medicines contrary to Poyſons ſeem to be helpful againſt the contagion of the Plague for this twofold Reaſon; Both becauſe the maſs of Blood and Viſcera being filled with the particles of theſe, and alſo the Spirits before poſſeſſed with the ſame, they do not eaſily admit of the company of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyſoned Infection; alſo, becauſe the Blood being incited by the gentle fury of theſe is kept from coagulation.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for preſervation, it follows now, that we ſpeak of the cure of the Plague. The doctrine of which, is either general, and comprehends remedies, which for this end, are taken from Diet, Chirurgery, and Medicine; or ſpecial, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers the uſe, and Cautions to be exhibited, about thoſe Remedies; and by what means we are to oppoſe the Symptoms variouſly ariſing.</p>
                     <p>Diet comprehends the uſe of the ſix non-naturals, but the chief care, and medical cautions, are to be given about eating, the primary Indications of this, conſiſt not at one and the ſame time together, but ought to be ſupplyed by turns, according to the nature of the thing, and the exigency of nature. In reſpect of the malignity, and of the loſs of ſtrength, Aliments are to be deſired, which greatly cheriſh the Spirits, and bring a more plentiful nouriſhment: in reſpect of the Feaveriſh diſtemper, a more ſlender refrigerating Diet, and temperating the Blood, ſeems to be required: The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician muſt regard either, but he may rather intend his Remedies againſt the maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than the Feaver.</p>
                     <p>The helps that belong to Chirurgery, are the opening a Vein, which ſeldom and very cautiouſly ought to be uſed in this Diſeaſe, becauſe the Blood being too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and the Veſſels falling down, ſweat is not ſo eaſily procured; inſtead of this, it is better to uſe Cupping, with ſcarification. For this, and Bliſtering, are rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed for the drawing forth of the Venom; moreover, againſt Buboes, Inflamations, or malignant Ulcers produced by them, Cataplaſms, Fomentations, Plaſters, Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and many other things, to be outwardly applyed, are to be ſought for from Chirurgery, in which ſome Poyſons, as the Electric of Poyſon, are preſcribed by ſome to be admixed; wherefore, preparations of Arsnick, to wit, the oil and balſom of it, are commended by many, in this caſe too of moſt excellent uſe and efficacy.</p>
                     <p>Medicines for the cure of the Plague, are either Evacuators, or Poyſon-reſiſters: The intention of the former is, that the ſerous Latex in the Blood, and the excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious humors, which abound in the Viſcera, be thruſt forth of doors; and together with them, very many particles of the invenomed Infection, every where diſperſed in the Body: But theſe are both Vomitories and Purgers, the uſe of which is more rare, and only in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, alſo Diaphoreticks or ſweating Medicines, which at ſome times may be ſuffered according as there is ſtrength, are to be preſcribed in the Plague: For theſe more fully, and from the whole body at once evacuate, yea, and by agitating the Blood, defend it from Congelation, and as they move from the Center, ſtill to the Circumference, they drive the empoyſoned ferment, alſo the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the Blood and humors, far from the heart, and ſo chaſe the Enemy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:152521:71"/>
the Camp. But Vomits, and Purges evacuate leſs univerſally, and by Concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating the malignant matter, oftentimes carry it inwardly, and fix it to the Bowels. But theſe Medicines, whether they operate by purging, or ſweating, ought to be of that kind, which have particles, rather agreeable to the empoyſoned infection, than to our Blood or Spirits; for ſuch a Medicine, will paſs through the various windings of our body, with its whole forces and unmixt, and by reaſon of the ſimilitude of either, more certainly takes hold of the virulent matter of the Diſeaſe, and carries it forth of doors with it ſelf, by the mutual adheſion of the parts, which way provoked nature leads. Wherefore, Medicines, whether Catharticks or Sudorificks, are commended before others, which are prepared out of Mercury, Antimony, Gold, Sulphur, Vitriol, Arſnick, and the like; which, when they cannot be ſubjugated by our heat, or maſtered, become the beſt Remedies againſt the Poyſon of a peſtilent Diſeaſe: for theſe do not only potently evacuate ſuperfluous things, but when as they put forth very ſtrong and untameable particles, and explicate them every where in the body, diſſipate the ferments of the Poyſon growing here and there, and hinder them from maturation; and as theſe Remedies, being of themſelves not to be overcome by Nature, are neceſſitated to be carried outwardly through the open paſſages of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they carry forth of doors with them, whatſoever extraneous or hoſtile thing is met with.</p>
                     <p>As to Poyſon-reſiſting Medicines, or Alexiterians, which are ſaid to reſiſt the Poyſon of this Diſeaſe, without any ſenſible evacuation, they are (for the moſt part) ſuch, whoſe particles are not very much of kin to Nature, ſo as to goe into Aliment; nor ſo diverſe, as to provoke to an excretion. The ſame being inwardly taken, and broken into the ſmalleſt pieces, inſpire the Blood, and juices flowing together in the Veſſels, and Viſcera, with their little bodies, as with a new ferment, and by moving the ſame gently, and by keeping them in an equal mixture, defend them from Coagulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Putrefaction; diſſipate the particles begun to be heaped up, one from another, by the ſame gentle agitation, and hinder them from maturity; and laſtly by pre-poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the Blood and Spirits, defend them from the impreſſions of the peſtilent mark. Among theſe, ſome more ſimple Remedies are commended as Rue, Scordium, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but moſt of all by far are eſteemed, thoſe that are compounded, wherefore, Treacle, Mithridate, and Diaſcordium, ſome of which are compos'd of no leſs than fifty ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; that, 'tis eſteemed a crime in Medicines ſo compleat in all numbers, to omit one Plant, or one Dram of them in their Compoſitions; the reaſon perchance is, becauſe very many things being put together, may make a maſs, whoſe diverſe kinds of particles being exalted, by long digeſtion, may ſtir up the greater fermentation in our Blood and humors.</p>
                     <p>Having after this manner ranked the Remedies, in which we ought to be inſtructed, for the curing of the Plague; now next we ſhould ſpeak of the method of cure, <hi>viz.</hi> What firſt, and then what next, ſhould be done in order: but that this Diſeaſe hath ſo precipitous a Courſe, that there is neither place for deliberation, nor is there frequently any Phyſician to be gotten, for fear of the Contagion; wherefore, there is no need here of of many preſcripts, or a long ſeries of Indications; this buſineſs is to be quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and may be comprehended in a few things. Therefore, when the peſtilence reigning, any one is diſtempered with the Contagion of this Diſeaſe, the help of the omnipotent God being requeſted by Prayers, preſently Remedies are to be flown to: If the Plague happens in a body not throughly purged, and prone to Vomiting, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently let a Vomit be taken, whoſe operation being finiſhed, immediatly let a ſweat be provoked, by taking Diaphoreticks, and the ſame continued as ſtrength can bear it, and afterwards be often repeated. Beſides, let Alexipharmicks or Poyſon-reſiſters, be uſed almoſt every moment, until by the eruption of Whelks, Inflamations, or Buboes, all the Venom be wholly driven forth of doors: but in the mean time, proper and reſpective Remedies, are to be oppoſed to the moſt urging Symptoms: but eſpecially, fit helps are to be ſought from Chirurgery, for the cure of the Buboes, and Plague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſores: the whole weight of this buſineſs, leans on theſe two Intentions, that the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous Poyſon may be every way expelled from within, and then, that the recourſe of what is driven forth, be with equal diligence prevented.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Plague, we cannot ſo readily write examples, and hiſtories of ſick perſons, with exact diaries of the Symptoms: becauſe theſe kind of ſickneſſes came not every year, neither when they ſpread, is it lawful for every Phyſician that takes care of his own health, frequently to viſit the ſick, or to ſtay long with them, whereby he may denote all accidents, and diligently conſider the reaſons of them; which task however, the renowned Diemerbrochius, did ſo firmly perſiſt in, that after him, others
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:152521:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may lawfully be ſuperſeded from this work: when ſomtimes paſt, in this City, <hi>viz.</hi> 1645. the Plague (tho not great) had ſpread, Doctor <hi>Henry Sayer,</hi> a very learned Phyſician, and happy in his practice, many others refuſing this province, boldly viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the ſick, poor, as well as rich, daily adminiſtred to them Phyſick, and handled with his own hands, their Buboes, and virulent Ulcers, and ſo cured very many ſick, by his ſedulous, tho dangerous Labour. That he might fortifie himſelf againſt the Contagion, before he went into the infected houſes, he was wont only to drink a large draught of Sack, and then his perambulation about the borders of Death, and the very jaws of the Grave being finiſhed, to repeat the ſame Antidote; After he had in this City, as if inviolable as to the Plague, a long while taken care of the affairs of the Sick without any hurt, he was ſent for to <hi>Wallingford</hi>-Caſtle, where this Diſeaſe cruelly Raged, as another Aeſculapius, by the Governour of the place: But there being ſo bold, as to lye in the ſame Bed, with a certain Captain (his intimate Companion) who was taken with the Plague, he quickly received the Contagion of the ſame Diſeaſe: nor were the Arts then profitable to the Maſter, which had been helpful to ſo many others, but there, with great ſorrow of the Inhabitants, nor without great loſs to the Medical Science, he dyed of that Diſeaſe. As to others, diſtempered by the Peſtilence, he was wont to order this kind of method of healing, if he was ſent for before the Buboes or Whelks appeared outwardly, for the moſt part he gave a Vomit, the preſcriptions of which were of the Infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> ſomtimes with white, and ſomtimes with Roman <hi>Vitriol:</hi> The Vomiting being ended he commanded them to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently put into a ſweat by the taking of Diaphoreticks; and thence, ſome intervals being granted, for the recovery of ſtrength, the ſweating to be continued to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the Diſeaſe: but if he were ſent for to the ſick, after the appearances of the marks, the Vomiting being let alone, he inſiſted only upon Sudorificks.</p>

                     <p>AFter having unfolded the Nature of the Plague, by the order of our Tract, we ought to proceed to the Diſeaſes, which ſeem to be neareſt like its Nature; which chiefly are Feavers, called Peſtilent and Malignant; for tis commonly noted, that Feavers ſomtimes reign popularly, which for the vehemency of ſymptoms, the great ſlaughter of the ſick, and the great force of contagion, ſcarce give place to the Peſtilence; which however, becauſe they imitate the type of Putrid Feavers, and do not ſo certainly kill the ſick as the Plague, or ſo certainly infect others, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the name not of the Plague, but by a more minute appellation of a Peſtilential Feaver: Beſides theſe, there are Feavers of another kind, the perniciouſneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of which appear more remiſs, yet, becauſe they are infeſtous, beyond the force of Putrid Feavers, and ſeem to contain in themſelves in a manner, the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or hand of God of Hippocrates, are yet by a more ſoft appellation, called Malignat Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Feavers differ both from the Peſt, and from one another according to the degree, and vehemency of contagion and deadlyneſs: as the Plague is a Diſeaſe highly contagious, and deadly to human kind; tis the Peſtilent Feaver, which commonly ſpreads with a leſſer diffuſion of its infection, and frequency of burials. When the infection is only ſuſpected, and the Criſis happens beyond the event of vulgar Feavers, only not to be truſted or leſs ſafe, tis eſteemed for a Malignant Feaver. They are yet more fully deſcribed thus.</p>
                     <p>When the Feaver commonly ſpreads abroad, which for the variety of ſymptoms, puts on the likeneſs of the Putrid Feaver ſo called, to wit, when there are preſent, Thirſt, Burning, Wearineſs, Anxiety, roughneſs of the Tongue, Watchings, Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Vomiting, want of Appetite, Syncopy, Swooning, Heart-pains, and a concourſe of other moſt terrible accidents; if there happen beſides, ſpots either like to the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Flea-bites, or broad ones like black and blew ſtrokes, and livid, we eſteem this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe of an evil Nature. If beſides theſe, it is not cured after the wonted manner of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:152521:72"/>
Feavers, but that the ſtrength of the ſick is caſt down, without any manifeſt cauſe, and that death comes often unlooked for and unſuſpected, againſt the Prognoſtic of the Phyſician, there is yet a greater cauſe of ſuſpicion of malignity: But if it kills very many of the ſick, and that thoſe who converſe with the ſick, contract the evil of the ſame Diſeaſe, that the ſame Diſeaſe ſpreads through all the Villages or Cities, it may be ſaid to be more than malignant, a peſtilential Feaver; which is yet fully proved, if it rages in very many ordinarily with a certain common ſymptom, as when a Squinancy, Dyſentery or deadly Sweat, ſuch as in times paſt ſpread in <hi>England,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany theſe ſort of Feavers.</p>
                     <p>If that a Feaver ariſes, which Diſtempers many living in the ſame Region together, almoſt after the ſame manner, which notwithſtanding obſerves the laws of a common Putrid Feaver in its courſe, and is cured almoſt after the ſame manner, this is not ſaid to be Peſtilent, but only a Malignant Feaver; unleſs that in ſome labouring with a remarkable Cacochymy, or fulneſs of ill humors, the appearances of Buboes, or of ſpots, ſomtimes with a deadly Criſis, and a contagion creeping upon others, betray ſome ſigns of Malignity.</p>
                     <p>If it be demanded, to which Claſs of the aforeſaid Feavers, theſe ſort of Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and Malignant Feavers ought to be placed, we aſcribe them only to the rank of continual Feavers; we diſcharge or acquit intermitting Feavers, becauſe by intervals they grant ſuch firm Truces to Nature, and then they regularly and exactly obſerve their periods, which does not conſiſt with an invenomed diſpoſition. Alſo we except Hectic Feavers from malignity, becauſe otherwiſe their mortality would not be ſo long delayed, but that partaking of Poyſon, they would kill ſooner: among continual Feavers, altho we affirm, that the ſimple ſynochal Feavers, are not free, yet they are rarely touched with this evil: but moſt of all, the Feaver which ſhews the notes of peſtility or malignity, is of that ſort, which reſembles the figure of the Putrid Feaver ſo called: for when in theſe Feavers, beſides the appearances of virulency, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a continual growing hot of the Blood, which paſſes through the courſes or ſtadia of beginning, increaſe, ſtanding and declination, as in Putrid Feavers, we deſervedly affirm here, the Sulphureous part of the Blood to be heated and inkindled, and by its burning to have brought in the Feaver: wherefore in theſe kind of Feavers, two things are eſpecially to be noted, the growing hot of the Blood and the malignity joyned with it, of which now this, now that is the greater: alſo, in both there is a great Latitude, and very many degrees of its intenſion or heat, according to which the Feaver becomes more or leſs acute or malignant.</p>
                     <p>The growing hot of the Blood is performed after the ſame manner, as is already ſaid concerning Putrid Feavers: to wit, the Sulphureous part of the Blood growing hot above meaſure, as it were takes fire by its fervor; in the time of its burning it accumulates a great quantity of aduſt matter, upon whoſe ſubaction and ſecluſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the ſtate and Criſis after the wonted manner of Feavers: but beſides theſe, the Blood being infected with a certain venomous taint, in the burning it begins by reaſon of the malignant ferment, to be coagulated into parts, and to putrifie: wherefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the uſual ſymptoms of the common Feaver, by reaſon of ſome congealed porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Blood, follow either deadly Diſtempers, Swooning, a dejection of the Spirits, alſo appearances of ſpots and marks: beſides venomous <hi>Effluvia,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the ſick, that are able to raiſe up the like Diſtemper in others, by the force of their contagion; wherefore by reaſon of its perniciouſneſs and contagion, and their various degrees, it is called, either a Peſtilent or Malignant Feaver.</p>
                     <p>Alſo whilſt the Blood growing hot, is infected with a venemous and malignant fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not only proper coagulations of its maſs, with a diſpoſition to putrifaction, are induced; but alſo the Nervous Liquor, eaſily contracts the taint of this, from whence it being made improportionate to the Brain and Regiment of the Animal Spirits, ſtirs up great irregularities in them: wherefore upon theſe ſort of Feavers, come not only ſpots and whelks, but moſt often a Delirium, Phrenſie, Sleepineſs, Tremblings of the Limbs, Cramps, and Convulſive motions; I have often obſerved, that in ſome certain years, Malignant Feavers have increaſed, which have ſhown their virulency, without the appearances of marks, chiefly about the Nervous ſtock; becauſe in ſome, preſently after the beginning, has followed a ſleepineſs, with a mighty heavineſs of the Head, in others, ſtrong Watchings, a perturbation of mind, with Trembling and Convulſive motions, but in moſt, either none, or only an uncertain Criſis, and inſtead of it, a tranſlation of the Feaveriſh matter to the Brain; beſides it is obſerved, that theſe Feavers creep upon others by contagion, and that very many are killed by them, that therefore they do deſerve to be called Malignant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="133" facs="tcp:152521:72"/>But theſe kind of Feavers are ſomtimes firſt begun from a venomous infection, and the Blood being touched with the Particles of the venom, conceives of it ſelf an Efferveſcency, and is inkindled; as when from a contagion or malignant Air being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, any one hath fallen into a Malignant Feaver, without any evident cauſe or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition: But ſomtimes the Feaveriſh Diſtemper is induced from a proper cauſe, and then the ſeeds of the Malignity, either lying hid within in the Body, exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Effervent Blood, or they come from another place by the contaminated Air, as it were the Food of the flame before inkindled; for it appears by frequent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in the time in which an Epidemical Feaver ſpreads, that others being any way ariſen, turn into it.</p>
                     <p>Malignant Feavers, as alſo Peſtilential, for the moſt part are popular, and invade many at once: but ſomtimes they are private, and not ordinary, ſo that perhaps only one or two are taken in the whole Region; in ſuch a caſe, it is to be ſuſpected that they come not from a malignant Air, or Epidemical cauſe, but from a morbous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Body; for I have often obſerved that when in the Spring or Autumn, a Feaver ſufficiently common, hath ſpread in ſome City or Town, of which very many have dyed, perhaps ſome one on whom an evil prediſpoſition, and a more ſtrong evident cauſe, hath brought the Feaver, hath lain by it, with more horrid ſymptoms, and great notes of malignity: in which caſe that malignity is not to be called common to the Feaver, but not ordinary, and accidental only.</p>
                     <p>Altho the greateſt reaſon of the difference, by which theſe kind of Feavers are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from one another, and from other Feavers, conſiſts in their deadlineſs and contagion; yet ſomtimes, they are noted with a certein peculiar ſymptom, from which they take for that time, both the note of malignity, and the appellation of the name: hence in ſome years an Epidemical Feaver reigns, which induces to moſt of the ſick a Squinancy, another time an inflamation of the Lungs, a Pleuriſie, Dyſentery, or ſome other diſtemper, and that oftentimes moſt dangerous, and contagious: ſo the ſeeds of Diſeaſes, not only derived from the Parents by traduction, excite their fruits as it were by a certain deſignation, in the ſame part or member; but alſo, thoſe received from an Infection commonly ſpreading, produce in all, a diſtemper of the ſame mode and figure: which yet I think to happen, not becauſe the ſeeds of the venomous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, reſpect either this or that Region of the Body, with a certain peculiar Virtue; but theſe ſo affect the maſs of Blood, by a like manner in all, that there is a neceſſity, for the ſake of waſhing away this ſtain, that a Criſis be attempted after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in all. For when, without malignity, the Blood, by reaſon of Coagulation, or perhaps other cauſes, is apt to be extravaſated, the uſual places, in which portions of the ſame being extravaſated, are wont to be fixed, are the Throat, Pleura, Lungs, and Inteſtines: wherefore, 'tis no wonder, when from a malignant cauſe, the congelation of the Blood, and for that reaſon an extravaſation is induced, if the Diſeaſe is neſted in the accuſtomed cheriſhing place of Nature.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the cauſes of theſe kind of Feavers, there is not much buſineſs: they are for the moſt part deduced, in reſpect of the malignity, from the vicious Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Air; in reſpect of the Feaveriſh heat, from the morbous proviſion of the Body: either of theſe, are eaſily made clear, by what hath been already ſaid, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Putrid Feaver, and the cauſes of the Peſtilence: If the malignity be ſtronger than the Feaver, and hath induced it, the impreſſion of it is to be imputed to the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Air, or to a Contagion received from others; if the Feaver be firſt, its inkindling is aſcribed to tranſpiration being hindred, to a Surfeit, or to ſome other of the evident cauſes above enumerated.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſigns, beſides contagion and deſtruction, theſe ſhew the malignity of the Feaver, a ſudden loſs of ſtrength, a weak and unequal pulſe, and evil affection of the Brain and nervous parts, being ſuddenly induced, cruel Vomitings, blackneſs of the Tongue, a ſuffuſion of darkneſs through the whole Body, but chiefly the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of Spots, Buboes, and of other marks.</p>
                     <p>For the cure of Feavers, both Peſtilential and Malignant, there is greater need of Judgment, and Circumſpection, than in any others whatſoever: For when there are two primary Indications, to wit, the Malignity, and the Feaveriſh intemperance, and when one can ſcarcely provide for the one, without detriment to the other, it is not eaſily to be diſcerned, which ſhould firſt be helped, or ſooneſt regarded. In reſpect of the Feaver, purging, opening a Vein, and cooling things, do chiefly help; but whilſt theſe are performed, the Malignity, for the moſt part is increaſed, and being neglected, ſpreads abroad more largely its Poyſon: againſt the Malignity, Poyſon-reſiſting Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials, and Diaphoreticks are required, but theſe extreamly heighten the Feaver, they
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:152521:73"/>
more ſhake the Blood and Spirits before inkindled, as it were with the blaſt of Bellows, and force all as it were into a flame; wherefore, here is great need of skill, that theſe things be rightly ordered in themſelves, and where there is moſt of danger appearing, thence the Curative Intentions are to be more immediatly deſigned; but ſo, as whilſt one is conſulted about, the other be not neglected. But in theſe caſes, beſides the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Judgment of every Phyſician, experience may ſupply the chief means of healing: for when as theſe Feavers firſt ſpread, every one almoſt tryes ſeveral Remedies, and by the ſucceſs of them collated together, it may be eaſily reckoned, what kind of method is to be relyed on, till at laſt, by a frequent tryal, or the footſteps of thoſe paſſing before, there is made as it were a high and broad Road, for the curing of theſe ſorts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, bounded both with various obſervations and warnings.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe ſort of Feavers, which ſpread on many at once, and by reaſon of the Contagion, deadlineſs, and conſpicuous notes of virulency, deſerve to be called Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or Malignant; there are ſome others, epidemical or popular, which almoſt every year, either in the Spring or Autumn, rage in ſome Countries; of which the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants for the moſt part of them are wont to be ſick, and not few, eſpecially of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to dye: In which notwithſtanding, no ſigns of Peſtilence or Malignity appear, neither does the Diſeaſe ſeem to ſpread, from one and ſo to another, ſo much by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, as to lay hold on many, by reaſon of a prediſpoſition, impreſſed almoſt on all. But theſe kind of diſtempers, depend chiefly upon the foregoing Conſtitution of the year: for if the ſeaſon going before was very intemperate, by reaſon of exceſs of cold or heat, of dryneſs or humidity, and ſo had continued for a long time, it changes our Blood very much, from its due temperature, whereby it is apt afterwards to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Feaveriſh efferveſcencies; and from hence a Feaver, now of this Type or Figure, now of that is produced; which preſently becomes Epidemical, becauſe it draws its beginning from a common cauſe, wherewith the bodies of all, are in a manner affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: But ſuch Feavers, foraſmuch as they depend upon the Blood having gotten a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, now ſharp, now auſtere, or of ſome other kind, by reaſon of the temper of the year, for the moſt part are of the rank of intermitting Feavers: yet, by a proper proviſion of Symptoms, they are wont to be noted, according to the peculiar Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of every year. Theſe are not able to be comprehended, under a certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rule, or formal reaſon, which may quadrat to the nature of each of theſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they vary every year, according to their ſeveral accidents. However, we will give you the deſcriptions of theſe kind of Feavers, ſpreading of late years in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, had at that time, for ſome ſpecimen of the reſt, and add it for a concluſion at the end of this Tract.</p>
                     <p>There yet remains to be aſcribed to the rank of malignant Feavers, ſome other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Feavers, and participating of no Contagion: of which ſort chiefly are thoſe, which are wont to happen to Child-bearing women, by reaſon of difficult and hard labour, or by reaſon of the ſtoppage of their Courſes. Indeed it ſufficiently appears, by common obſervation, that theſe are very dangerous, and often mortal: for if, by the parts of the Womb being hurt, or by cold being admitted, or perhaps by any other cauſe, the Courſes are ſtopped, and the humour which ought to be thruſt forth, ſhall be confuſed with the maſs of the Blood, it moſt wickedly infects it, as it were with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain venomous mixture; that by that means, preſently a Feaver is excited, which with an evil proviſion of Symptoms, is very much beſet, <hi>viz.</hi> with heat, and cruel thirſt, Vomiting, pain of the Heart, and watchings, and for the moſt part obtains, either no Criſis, or a very difficult one: becauſe, unleſs the wonted way of the flux of the Courſes, may be at length reſtored, it is wont, after the heat of the Blood hath been continued for ſome days, to Communicate the evil to the Brain, and nervous ſtock; from whence, by and by, a Delirium, Phrenſie, Convulſions, and other moſt wicked diſtempers, are moſt often induced, which do not ſeldom end in Death: but theſe ſort of Feavers deſerve a peculiar conſideration which we have more fully determined to ſhew hereafter in a particular diſcourſe concerning this buſineſs; in the mean time, we will undertake to propoſe ſome inſtances or examples of the Feavers, but now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Peſtilent, and Malignant.</p>
                     <p>The peſtilent Feaver, of late years, hath more rarely ſpread in theſe Regions, than the Plague it ſelf: of the only one of this kind, which fell under our obſervation, I will give you a brief deſcription. In the year 1643, when in the coming on of the Spring, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> beſieged <hi>Reading,</hi> being held for the King, in both Armies there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a Diſeaſe to ariſe very Epidemical; however, they perſiſting in that work, till the beſieged were forced to a ſurrender, this Diſeaſe grew ſo grievous, that in a ſhort time after, either ſide left off, and from that time, for many months, fought not with the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:152521:73"/>
Enemy, but with the Diſeaſe: as if there had not been leiſure to turn aſide to another kind of Death, this deadly Diſeaſe increaſing, they being already overthrown by Fate, and as it were falling down before this one Death. <hi>Eſſexe</hi>'s Camp moving to the <hi>Thames,</hi> pitched in the places adjacent, where he ſhortly loſt a great part of his men: But the King returned to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where at firſt, the Souldiers being diſpoſed in the open Fields, then afterwards among the Towns and Villages, ſuffered not much leſs: For his Foot, (which it chiefly invaded) being pact together in cloſe houſes, when they had filled all things with filthineſs, and unwholſom naſtineſs, and ſtinking odors (that the very Air ſeemed to be infected) they fell ſick by Troops, and as it were by Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons. At length the Feaver now more than a Camp Feaver invaded the unarmed and peaceable Troops, to wit, the entertainers of the Souldiers and generally all others, yet at firſt (the Diſeaſe being yet but lightly inflicted) tho beſet with an heavy and long languiſhment, however many eſcaped. About the Summer Solſtice this Feaver began alſo to increaſe with worſe proviſion of Symptoms, and to lay hold on the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, and others inhabiting the Country. Then afterwards, ſpread through our City, and all the Country round, for at leaſt Ten miles about. In the mean time, they who dwelt far from us, in other Counties remained free from hurt, being as it were without the ſphere of the Contagion. But here this Diſeaſe became ſo Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal that a great part of the people was killed by it; and aſſoon as it had entred an houſe, it run through the ſame, that there was ſcarce one left well to adminiſter to the ſick; ſtrangers, or ſuch as were ſent for to help the ſick, were preſently taken with the Diſeaſe; that at length, for fear of the Contagion, thoſe who were ſick of this Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, were avoided by thoſe who were well, almoſt as much, as if they had been ſick of the Plague.</p>
                     <p>Nor indeed, did there a leſs mortality, or ſlaughter of men, accompany this Diſeaſe: becauſe Cachectic, and Pthiſical old men, or otherways unhealthful, were killed by it; alſo not a few of Children, young men, and thoſe of a more mature and robuſt age. I remember in ſome Villages, that almoſt all the old men dyed this year, that there were ſcarce any left, who were able to defend the manners and priviledges of the Pariſh, by the more anciently received Traditions.</p>
                     <p>When this Feaver firſt began, it was ſomthing like the figure of a putrid Synochus; but it was harder to be cured, and when it ſeemed to be helped by a ſweat or looſneſs, preſently it was wont to be renewed again: but for the moſt part, after the deflagrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Blood, continued for ſix or ſeven days, this remitting, and inſtead of a Criſis the aduſt matter being tranſlated to the Brain, the ſick for a long time keeping their Beds with raging ſomtimes, but more often with a ſtupefaction, with great weakneſs, and ſomtimes with Convulſive motions, ſcarcely eſcaped at laſt. About the middle of the Summer, beſides the Contagion and frequent burials, this Diſeaſe betrayed its malignity, and peſtilential force in open ſigns, <hi>viz.</hi> By the eruption of Whelks and Spots: becauſe about this time in many there appeared without any great burning of the Feaver, an unequal, weak, and very much diſordered pulſe; alſo without a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt expenſe of Spirits, their ſtrength preſently became languiſhing, and very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected: In others, ſick after the ſame manner, appeared little Bliſters or Meaſles, now ſmall and red, now broad and livid: in many, Buboes, (as in the Plague) about the glandulas: of theſe ſome died ſilently and unforeſeen, without any great ſtrugling of the Spirits, or Feaveriſh burning excited in the Blood: in the mean time others, by and by becoming furibundous, whilſt they lived ſuffered moſt horrid diſtractions, of the animal Spirits. Thoſe about to eſcape from this Diſeaſe, without any laudible Criſis, (unleſs they were the ſooner freed by a ſweat provoked by Art) the Brain, and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſtock becoming diſtempered, at length, with a benummedneſs of the ſenſes, tremblings, vertigo, debility of the members, and Convulſive motions, did not grow well but of a long time after. During the Dog-days, this Diſeaſe being ſtill infeſtous, began to be handled not as a Feaver, but as a leſſer Plague, and to be overcome only by Poyſon-reſiſting Remedies; letting of Blood, was believed to be fatal to this: Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and Purges, ſomtimes tho not often, were made uſe of, but the chiefeſt means of Cure, were accounted to be procured by Alexiteriums, and timely ſweat. For this end, beſides the preſcripts, of Phyſicians, to be had at the Apothecaries, ſome Emperical Remedies deſerved no ſmall praiſe; then firſt of all, the pouder of the Counteſs of <hi>Kent,</hi> began to be of great eſteem in this Country; alſo of no leſs note was another pouder, of the colour of Aſhes, which a certain Courtier ſtaying by chance in this City, gave to many with good ſucceſs; and to others approving of the uſe of it, he ſold it at a great price; the ſick were wont having taken half a dram of this, in any Liquor, to fall into a moſt plentiful ſweat, and ſo to be freed from the virulency of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:152521:74"/>
Diſeaſe; That Diaphoretick (whoſe preparation I afterwards learnt, from the Couſen German of the Author) was only the pouder of Toads, purged throughly with Salt, and then waſhed in the beſt Wine, and lightly calcined in an earthen Pot. The Autumn coming on, this Diſeaſe by degrees remitted its wonted fierceneſs that fewer grew ſick of it and of them many grew well; till the approach of the Winter, when this Feaver almoſt wholly vaniſhed, and health was rendred to this City, and the Country round about fully and wholly.</p>
                     <p>Thus you have ſeen the beginning, progreſs, and end of this Feaver, at firſt only a Camp Feaver, but at length became Peſtilential, and Epidemical. That at firſt the Diſeaſe began in the Souldiers Camp, may ſeem to be imputed, not only to their naſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſtinking ſmells, but in ſome ſort to a common vice of the Air, for as theſe Feavers come not every year, their original may be aſcribed, partly to the peculiar Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the year. Becauſe, by that means, a more light intemperance of the Air being contracted, tho it did not affect the more healthful Inhabitants; yet in the Army, where evident cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> errors in the ſix non-naturals, very much happen to the general procatartic cauſe, there is a neceſſity for theſe kind of ſickneſſes eaſily to be excited. For the conſtitution of this year, was in the Spring very moiſt, and ſlab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, almoſt with continual ſhours, to which a more hot Summer ſucceeding, and the infection of the Feaveriſh Contagion here firſt increaſing, ſtill grew worſe, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all Bodies the more for the receiving it; wherefore, that this Diſeaſe was almoſt proper to this Region, and at this time Epidemical, the ſeed of it ought to be aſcribed to its firſt riſing from the Army, being quartered round about. But foraſmuch, as it afterwards being made Peſtilential, and very Epidemical, it infected moſt of the people living here, and killed not a few, the reaſon was, the evil affection of the Air; which becauſe of the intemperance of the year being unwholſom, beſides by the continual breathing forth of ſtinking vapours from the Souldiers Camps, and the quarters of the ſick, it became at laſt ſo vitious, that the infection of the Feaver, being diſperſed in it, was greatly exalted, and aroſe almoſt to the virulency of the Plague. <hi>Diemerbrochius</hi> relates from the like Camp Feaver, ariſing in the Summer at <hi>Spires,</hi> afterwards another Malignant and Peſtilential, and then the Plague it ſelf to have accrewed. Alſo, it was a ſign that this Feaver of ours, became at laſt equal to the Plague it ſelf, beſides the great force of the Contagion, and the frequency of Burials, moſt wicked diſtempers of the Blood, and nervous Liquor, being brought preſently upon all, by it: becauſe, ſtrength being ſuddenly overthrown, the weak intermitting pulſe, the creeping forth of meaſly Bliſters, the eruption of Buboes, argued the Coagulation, and corruptive diſpoſition of the Blood: beſides the Delirium, Madneſs, Phrenſie, Stupefaction, Sleepineſs, Vertigo, Tremblings, Convulſive motions, and divers other diſtempers of the Head, ſhewed the great hurt of the Brain, and nervous ſtock.</p>
                     <p>That the figure, or Idea of this malignant Feaver, may be painted to the life, very many obſervations or hiſtories of ſick people, are eaſily to be had; of the many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this Diſeaſe, I ſhall only mention a few, which hapned ſome years ſince in the houſe of a venerable man, and as with a mournful ſlaughter, ſo not without ſome admiration.</p>
                     <p>About the Winter Solſtice, in the year 1653. a youth of about Seven years old, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manifeſt cauſe, found himſelf ill, being troubled with a pain of his Head, Sleepineſs, and mighty Stupefaction; with it he had a Feaver, tho not ſtrong, with an ordinary burning, which grew more grievous, only by wandring fits, ſomtimes once, ſomtimes twice in Twenty four hours ſpace: preſently from the beginning, he ſlept almoſt continually, alſo he was wont in his ſleep to cry out, to talk idly, and to leap often out of his Bed; being awakned, and ſomtimes of his own accord awaking, he preſently came to himſelf, and conſtantly called for drink; his Urine was red, and full of Contents, his pulſe equal, and ſtrong enough; in his wriſts appeared light contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of the tendons, and in his neck, and other parts of his Body, ſome red ſpots like Flea-bites. At the firſt, was ordered a light Purgation, and a frequent taking down of the Belly, by the uſe of Clyſters; he daily took Cordial Julaps, with Poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſters; Veſicatories or bliſtering Plaſters, were applyed to his neck, and other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to the ſoles of his feet: on the ſixth day, a little Blood ſtreamed from his noſtrils; on the ſeventh, without any manifeſt through Criſis, the Feaver very much abated, the heat ſo gentle as to be perceived only by the Touch; alſo, the Urine pale, thin, and without any ſediment, yet he was much more grieviouſly troubled with ſleepineſs, and a ſtupefaction of the Head, ſo that his Urine, and the excrements of his Belly came away involuntarily; however, being called upon, he knew the ſtanders by, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their queſtions; Theſe diſtempers, notwithſtanding the Remedies every day
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:152521:74"/>
grew worſe: About the Fourteenth day, the ſick youth became ſo ſtupid, as neither to be able to underſtand, nor to ſpeak, yet he ſwallowed ſtill what was put into his mouth, tho unknowingly, and his pulſe was laudable enough: about this time, he fell into a Flux, excited of it ſelf by Nature for four day, which at laſt ceaſing, a whiteiſh cruſt or ſcurf, and as it were Chaulky, began to ſpread over the whole cavity of his Mouth and Throat, which being often in a day wiped away, new preſently broke forth: when he had thus for four days more been ſick, he became better in his intellect, and ſenſe, ſo that he was able to know his Parents and Friends, to take notice of their words, and to do ſomthing as he was bid: but as his ſenſitive faculty began to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, ſo he began to grow worſe as to his ſpeech and the Organs of ſwallowing; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt the matter being fallen from the Brain, into the beginnings of the Nerves, a Palſie in the Tongue and Throat had ſucceeded to the heavineſs and ſtupefaction: which diſtemper in a ſhort time ſo increaſed, that afterwards the ſick perſon could not ſwallow at all, but that what he took in at the Mouth preſently flowed back again, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could any thing go down into the Stomach; when beſides the cruelty of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, there was danger leaſt he ſhould be killed by Famine, an Inſtrument was prepared of a pin of Chalk, put into a little pliant wand, and on the top of it, a little tuft of ſilk made fit; and this being thruſt down his Throat, opened the cloſing for a time, whereby the Food taken in, was ſuffered to paſs, after the uſe of this for a day or two, he was able to ſwallow again, and afterwards to take his Food well enough: and within a few days, he began to ſpeak, to diſcern any thing, and becoming wonderful hungry, to ask for, all day long, all ſorts of Food, and greedily to devour what ever was brought to him. In the mean time, by reaſon of his long ſickneſs, and the Nervous parts being grievouſly hurt; he was grown ſo Lean, that the Bones ſcarce ſticking to the Skin, he repreſented exactly a living Skeleton. But afterwards, by the ſedulous, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable, and prudent care of the Mother about his diet, he recovered perfect Health, and is yet living, and well.</p>
                     <p>When this child had hardly arived to the height of his ſickneſs, his Brother, elder about two years, on the Ides of <hi>January,</hi> was taken almoſt after the ſame manner. At firſt he was troubled with a Torpor and heavineſs of the Head, then growing Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh, with a ſleepineſs and ſtupidity: he began to talk idly in his ſleep, then being awake hardly to come to himſelf: after four or five days, theſe ſymptoms grew more grievous: he was able to underſtand little, nor ſcarce to ſpeak articulately, and not without ſtammering. His Urine was thick, cloudy, without Hypoſtaſis, or ſetling of the Contents: there appeared, as in his Brother, red ſpots, ſmall, like Flea-bites; his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements both of his Belly and Bladder, came away involuntarily. But his Pulſe was yet ſtrong and equal; his Hypochondria were ſtretched out, and inflated with a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of the Abdomen; about the eighth day, he had a ſmall ſtream of Blood: on the eleventh day of his ſickneſs, he fell into a Diarrhaea, by which, in the ſpace of five hours, he caſt forth ſeven times, bilous, thin, and highly ſtinking ſtuff, from whence there was ſome hope of his amendment; but the next day after, the flux of his Belly ceaſing, pains, and torments cruelly infeſted his Belly, that crying out and moaning night and day, he ſent forth moſt heavy complaints; his Hypochondria and Abdomen were tumid like a Tympany, and mightily diſtended; when he could not receive any thing of eaſe, from no remedies, the moſt exquiſite skill of many Phyſicians being tryed, on the fourteenth day he died Convulſive, in theſe torments.</p>
                     <p>A little after his death, <hi>viz.</hi> on the thirteenth of <hi>February,</hi> his Brother, elder than him, about eleven years old, a youth of great hopes, began to be Feaveriſh; and as the others, with a Torpor and heavineſs of his Head, tho leſs ſtrongly affected; but the heat in the Blood was greater, which was of a more hot temperament, and greater perturbation appeared, that for the firſt ſix days, beſides heat and thirſt, he was troubled with a continual endeavour of excretion, now by ſweat, now by ſtool. His Urine was red and troubled; ſome red ſpots as in the reſt broke forth; on the ſeventh day he had a bleeding about five Ounces, which ceaſing, a great benumedneſs ſucceeded, that for all that day and the night following, he could ſcarce lift up his Eyes: on the eighth day, a moſt plentiful bleeding followed again at the Noſe, that there was danger, leſt he ſhould have loſt his life, together with his Blood: the Blood ſprang ſo copiouſly from his left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtril, that being received in a Baſon, it made little Bladders or bubbles by its fall: when he had loſt above two pound of Blood, and being taken with a cold ſweat, began to loſe his ſtrength, remedies were at length adminiſtred, and the Flux was yet hardly ſtopped. The Haemorrhage being ſtayed, the Youth ſlept ſoundly, and all that day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſleepy: yet often awakning, he remained well in his ſenſes and was quick in ſenſe, and underſtanding; and being asked of his health, he ſaid he was pretty well; his
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:152521:75"/>
Urine, which was before red and troubled, then appeared pale, thin, and with a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Hypoſtaſis, that the ſick ſeemed, (eſpecial becauſe he wanted thirſt, or immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heat) to be perfectly cured and freed from the Feaver: on the following morning, being the ninth day of the Feaver, he remained yet torpid, but being raiſed up, he living chearfully and without intemperance, ſeemed to be in a condition of growing well, but that he began a little to faulter in his ſpeech: in the evening, when it was leſt ſuſpected, the Feaver being again inkindled, on a ſudden he fell into a Lethargy, that he was ſcarce able to be awakned from ſleep, and being pulled, ſcarce to know any body, or to ſpeak plainly: altho ſo great a loſs of Blood had gone before, the Pulſe was yet quick, high, and vehement, alſo his Urine red: after deriving, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing remedies, had been uſed all that Night, this Youth ſeemed to be in a little better condition, ſo that in the morning, he continued a long time from ſleep, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to role about his Eyes hither and thither, and to ſet himſelf up a little; yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking, or knowledg of thoſe that were about him: before noon, his Eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhut again, he wholly loſt the uſe of every Animal faculty: he lay for three days, as it were Apoplectick, with an high and vehement Pulſe, with a palpitation of the Heart, and a difficult and painful breathing; his Pulſe at length growing leſſer by degrees, he dyed the thirteenth day of the Feaver.</p>
                     <p>On the fifteenth of <hi>February,</hi> his Siſter, ſomwhat leſſer than he was, began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of a pain and torments in her Belly, a trembling in her hands, and a painful tenſion or ſtretching out of the Muſcles of her Neck, with a Feaveriſh intemperance, and thirſt: on the laſt day of <hi>February,</hi> ſhe growing plainly into a Feaver, could not keep out of her Bed: moreover ſhe was troubled with a wandring heat, now in her Face, now about her lower parts; alſo ſhe became heavy and ſomnolent, and awaking from ſleep, could not preſently come to her ſelf. On the firſt of <hi>March</hi> ſhe was lightly Purged and with eaſe, with an expreſſion of Rhubarb: her Urine was thick and red; elſo petechial red ſpots, (as in the reſt) were conſpicuous: we gave her after that, for four days, at ſeveral times, to wit, after the interval of every ſix hours ſpace, ten drops of the ſpirit of Harts-Horn, in a Spoonful of Cordial Julep; the aforeſaid ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms afterwards leiſurly remitted, and this ſick child, tho ſlowly, recovered health without a manifeſt through Criſis.</p>
                     <p>About the ſame time her little Brother, younger than any of theſe, fell ſick almoſt after the like manner; who, yet, a looſneſs ariſing Naturally of it ſelf, for many days, voyding Choleric and greeniſh ſtuff, was eaſily cured. Alſo in the ſame Family, many other Domeſtics, and ſome ſtrangers coming to help them, the evil being propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Contagion, fell ſick of the ſame Diſeaſe: who notwithſtanding, at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came well, tho with difficulty, and ſlowly, without any regular Criſis being made.</p>
                     <p>That this Feaver was malignant, plainly appears by the Contagion, Mortality, and appearances of ſpots, and many other ſigns; tho that infecting Contagion, whereby it ſpread from one to another, ſhewed it ſelf ſlow, and of leſſer Efficacy: becauſe, between the ſickneſſes of each of them, many days, and oftentimes weeks hapned to be, that the infection of this tho acute Diſeaſe, and the diſſemination on others, was ſcarcely finiſhed in four months ſpace, in the ſame Houſe. The Feaver about the firſt beginning ſeemed gentle and mild, not very terrible as to burning; but the matter being heaped together, from the deflagration of the Blood, became preſently untame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, hard to be exterminated, alſo enemical to the Brain and Nervous ſtock; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in each of them, the beginning of the Diſeaſe, was to be known rather by the torpor and ſomnolency, than the fervor and heat; alſo, the Criſis, tho by ſeveral ways attempted, <hi>viz.</hi> by Sweat, Flux, Bleeding, did not happily ſucceed, but for moſt part, the Blood growing turgid with the critical motion, endeavoured to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Feaveriſh matter, upon the dwellings of the Animal Spirits; yet it ſelf not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, became not putrified by this means, but that about the ſtanding of the Diſeaſe, both humors (to wit the Blood and Nervous Juice) being vitiated, by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure mixture together, and grievouſly touched, cauſed the event of the Diſeaſe, to be either deadly, or extream dangerous.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the Meaſles and Small-Pox.</head>
                     <p>IN the next place, we refer the Small-pox and Meaſles to the rank of peſtilential and malignant Feavers, which indeed are mixt Diſtempers, conſiſting at once according, and contrary to our Nature. As to their Original, they have their ſeminary born with us: but as to the effect, they produce preternatural ſymptoms, and (as the Plague it ſelf) poyſonous; ſo that they conſtitute ar it were a certain peculiar kind of Feavers, proper indeed to men, but after another manner, than Porphyrius has aſſigned; for it happens for every man only, and once to be diſtempered with the Small-pox or Meaſles: if perchance any one lives free their whole life, or another more often fall into theſe Diſtempers, they are rare and unuſual events of Nature, which leſſen not common obſervation; yea tis fully confirmed, to wit, that all, and only men are obnoxious to the Small-pox and Meaſlles, and are wont to be rid of them at one ſickneſs. Concerning the Small-pox, we will treat of them apart from the Meaſles, what the cauſe of them is, then what ſigns and ſymptoms they have, and laſtly what things belong to the Criſis and Cure.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Cauſes, we ought to conſider in the firſt place, what is the ſecret leading Cauſe, to wit, which renders only and all mankind, and that once, obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to this Diſeaſe. Secondly, we will inquire concerning the evident Cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> by what and how many ways, this latent and occult diſpoſition, is wont to be, now ſooner now later, deduced into Act. Thirdly, it ſhall be declared, what is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct cauſe, to wit, by what motion and alteration of the Blood, the figure of this Diſeaſe is produced.</p>
                     <p n="1">1, As to the firſt, this diſpoſition or Natural prediſpoſition, which inclines human kind to this Diſeaſe, ſeems to be a certain evil or impurity of the Blood, conceived in the Womb, among the firſt Rudiments of Generation; almoſt all Authors, would have this aſcribed to the Menſtruous Blood: which Opinion ſeems not altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable: becauſe in a womans Womb, (otherways than in moſt other living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) there is generated a certain Ferment, which being communicated to the maſs of Blood, affords to it vigour and ſpirit, and then at ſet periods, procures a ſwelling up, and an excretion of the ſuperfluous Blood; but at the time of Conception, when the <hi>Menſtrua</hi> wholly ceaſe, very much of this ferment is beſtowed on the <hi>Faetus</hi> or Child; and its Particles, being Haeterogeneous to all the reſt, as a certain extraneous thing, are confuſed with the maſs of Blood and humors; with which being involved and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated one from another, lurk or ly hid a long while; yet afterwards, at ſome time, being moved or ſtirred up, by ſome evident cauſe, they ferment with the Blood, and induce to it an ebullition, and then a Coagulation; from whence very many ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of this Diſeaſe ariſe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe fermentative ſeeds ſomtimes are few and gentle, and ſo involved with other little Bodies, as they do not eaſily appear, and are brought into act; ſomtimes they are more and ſtranger; ſo that on the leaſt occaſion they are ripened into this Diſeaſe; hence indeed ſome are taken ſooner, with the Small-Pox in their tender years: others more ſlowly, and not till full or more ripe age: alſo ſome eaſily receive the contagion, but others converſe often with the ſick without danger. The ſooner that any one hath this Diſeaſe, the more ſecure they are; wherefore children moſt often eſcape, old men, or ſuch as are of years, are more in danger, <hi>viz.</hi> in children or young people, tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is more eaſie, alſo the habit of the Body more firm and healthful. But altho the venomous ſeeds of this Diſeaſe, for the moſt part are wont to be diſperſed or blown away at once, and with one ſickneſs; yet it ſomtimes happens, that a part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infection being ſtill left, the ſick have fallen into this Diſeaſe twice or thrice.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The evident cauſe which ſtirs up theſe fermentative ſeeds, and moſt often brings them into act, may be ſaid to be threefold, <hi>viz.</hi> The contagion received from ſome place: the diſpoſition of the Air, and the immoderate perturbation of the Blood and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. It is moſt manifeſt by daily experience, that this Diſeaſe doth come upon others, and ſpread abroad by contagion; <hi>viz.</hi> from the infected Body, continually flow <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:152521:76"/>
which being received by other Bodies, preſently like poyſon they ferment with the Blood, and ſuſcitate or awaken the lurking or ſleeping ſeeds of the ſame Diſeaſe, Homogeneous with themſelves, and diſpoſe them into the figure or Idea of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe: neither is the infection only communicated by contact, but at a diſtance. They who live within the ſame houſe, or neighbouring to the ſick, eaſily receive the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; alſo it is cheriſhed in Cloaths, and diſſipated afar off, and transferred to more remote places. They who are of kin one to another, ſooneſt infect each other: alſo they who are fearful, and extreamly dread this Diſeaſe, more readily fall into it: For by fear, the Particles of the infection are conveyed inwardly from the ſuperficies of the Body. At what time the contagion ſpreads, and that the Small-pox are Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical, all other Diſeaſes almoſt degenerate into this. Secondly, a certain peculiar diſpoſition of the Air, notably induces the Small-pox; hence moſt often it becomes Popular, and rages ordinarily through whole Regions, Cities and Villages; hence alſo it more often exiſts in the Spring and Autumn: becauſe at that time eſpecially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe manners of little Bodies, and by that means tumultuating flow about in the Air, which we draw in with the vital Air, and ſo various efferveſcencies of the Blood and Humors, and Ideas of Diſeaſes are raiſed up, Neither doth this Diſeaſe become only more frequent and Epidemical, for theſe Cauſes, but alſo it gets a manifold Nature, that ſomtimes the Small-pox are deadly, and as it were peſtiferous, and ſomtimes they are more mild and benign; to wit, as they have contracted more or leſs of malignity from the Air; hence alſo ſomtimes black and livid Whelks or Puſtils appear, and have much of the Nature of the Plague. Thirdly, ſomtimes, tho the tinder of contagion be abſent, and that no malignant conſtitution of the Air had gone before, yet by reaſon of the Blood and Humors being immoderately diſturbed, the Small-pox do ariſe: ſo I have known ſome to have fallen into this Diſeaſe, from a ſurfeit, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate exerciſe, when none beſides in the whole Country about, hath been ſick of it, to wit, the ſeeds of this evil, lying hid, without any previous infection, being ſtirred up by a too great fervor of the Blood, and being aſſociated, gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eaſily defile, and infect the whole maſs of the Blood, with their ferment.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 So much for the ſecret leading, and evident cauſes, but as to the conjunct cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> which is the formal reaſon of this Diſeaſe, or the manner of its being made, the buſineſs ſeems a little more intricate. It is commonly wont to be compared to Muſt growing hot, or Beer when it Purges in the Vat: For if you put to theſe Liquors, any thing of ferment: as their Particles are Heterogeneous, and of wonderful activity, preſently they diffuſe themſelves through the whole ſubſtance of the Liquor, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agitate the more thick and impure Bodies, againſt which they are daſhed, beat them aſunder, and role about them, until a flowring being made, they drive the ſame from the intimate embrace or company of the Liquor, to the outmoſt ſuperficies. After the like manner the Heterogeneous ſeeds of this Diſeaſe, are thought to ferment the Blood, and then by a certain eruption of Whelks or Puſtles, like the flowring, purifies it. But indeed, if we ſhould more ſtrictly conſider the buſineſs, there will appear here a great difference: becauſe the infection of the Small-pox, is as it were a ferment, but corruptive, and compels the Blood to grow hot, not towards perfection, but depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; for when the Particles of this venomous infection ſtrike againſt the receiving ſubject, they preſently raiſe up little Bodies like to themſelves, and born with us, with which being aſſociated, they paſs through the whole maſs of the Blood, and make it to grow highly turgid, and to boil up, and after ſome time growing fervent, to go into parts, and to be coagulated, <hi>viz.</hi> the diſperſed ſeeds of the Poyſon, diſſolve the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Blood, preſently profligate the more pure Spirits, then they joyn its more thick Particles to themſelves, and by their adheſion, render them as it were congealed: The portions being ſo coagulated, together with the infolded ſeeds of the poyſon, being left by the reſt of the Blood, in its circuit, between the extremities of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, are affixed to the skin: by which means, if Nature being ſtrong enough, doth caſt forth the whole poyſon, with the congealed Blood, the remaining maſs of the Blood, altho made poorer, remains however in a condition to continue life and health: but if the Blood, being too exceſſively congealed, cannot be purified after this manner; or if portions of the Blood growing together with the poyſon, do not fully break forth, or at laſt do ſtagnate within, they wholly corrupt the Liquor of the Blood, or elſe being affixed to the Viſcera, and eſpecially to the Heart, they deſtroy their conſtitution and ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:152521:76"/>Portions of the congealed Blood, with the poyſon, begin to break forth about the fourth day, (now ſooner now later:) becauſe coagulation is not preſently induced, but after ſome time, in which the venom unfolds it ſelf, and ferments the Blood with its effervency: Firſt, light portions of the infected Blood, and thoſe but few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, like to Flea-bites, are fixed in the skin: quickly after more appear, and thoſe firſt broke forth, by the acceſſion of new matter, and by the continual appulſion of the congealed Blood, increaſe and are elevated into a tumor: then theſe whelks at firſt red being by degrees increaſed, at length grow white; <hi>viz.</hi> the Blood being thruſt forth of the Veſſels with the poyſon, by reaſon of the heat and ſtagnation, is changed into matter: about the ſeventh day after the eruption, the white tumors grow cruſty, into a dry ſcab; for the more thin part of the matter being evaporated, the reſt grows hard, which then having eaten, and broke off the Cuticula, or outward thin skin, falls away from the fleſh or next skin.</p>
                     <p>When the infection of the Small-pox, is at once impreſſed on the Blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, it very rarely can be blotted out, or diſſipated by Medicines, or blood letting; but that its hidden diſpoſition, will break forth into act; wherefore at firſt it diffuſes it ſelf by little and little, and inſpires the maſs of Blood, as it were with a ferment, hence an ebullition and growing hot are produced in the whole Body, the Veſſels are diſtended, the Viſcera provoked, the membranes pulled, until the ſeeds of the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by fuſing and coagulating the Blood, being at length involved with its congealed portions, are thruſt forth of doors. The eſſence of this Diſeaſe will be better laid open, if that I ſhall recount the ſigns and ſymptoms, which are to be obſerved in its whole courſe, and ſhall add in order the reaſons and cauſes of them, on which they depend: but they are thoſe which either indicate the Diſeaſe being preſent, or that foretel its ſtate and event.</p>
                     <p>As to the Diagnoſis of this Diſeaſe, by which it may be known, whether any one at firſt falling ſick, will have the Small-pox or not; at that time are to be conſidered, the force of the contagion, and the concourſe of the ſymptoms firſt appearing; for if by reaſon of the evil conſtitution of the Air, this Diſeaſe doth ſpread abroad every where, none then is taken with a Feaver, without the ſuſpition of the Small-pox, eſpecially if they never had them before in their lives; but if this Diſeaſe be more rare, and without fear of contagion, yet its unlooked for aſſault quickly betrays it ſelf, by theſe ſort of ſigns and ſymptoms.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is a wandring and uncertain Feaver, ſomtimes ſtrong, ſomtimes more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, obſerving no reaſon of increaſe, or growing continually hot, ſo that the ſick are now highly hot, by and by without any evident cauſe, they are without a Feaver; the cauſe of which is, for that the fermentative ſeeds are not agitated by an equal motion, but like fire half choaked, now increaſes more, and now are almoſt quelled, and ready to expire; until the burning ſpreading more largly, the flame every where breaks forth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A pain in the Head, and Loins, is ſo peculiar a ſign in this Diſeaſe, that it almoſt alone, in a continual Feaver, ſignifies the approach of the ſmall-pox: the reaſon of which is commonly imputed, to the greater Veſſels being very much diſtended, by the effervency of the Blood: but indeed it appears not, wherefore the ſame trouble is not cauſed equally in other parts, by reaſon of the like diſtention of the Veſſels, and wherefore in the ſmall-pox, more than in a burning Feaver, or in other Feavers, where the Blood grows more hot, theſe kind of pains ſhould increaſe; yea, it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that great pains, now in the Head, now in the Loins, do urge, when the Blood but little ſwelling up, the Veſſels are not amplified, <hi>viz,</hi> in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, when the Feaveriſh diſtemper is not yet conſpicuous, whilſt the ſick as yet goe abroad, and are well in their ſtomach, upon the firſt coming on of the ſmall-pox, they betray themſelves by theſe kind of pains. Wherefore, the cauſe of theſe kind of dolorific pains, ſeems rather to ſubſiſt in the nervous ſtock, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Brain, and ſpinal marrow, and that by reaſon of the membranes, and nervous parts being pulled or hauled, by the particles of the Poyſon, theſe pains do ariſe. For it is moſt likely, that the innate ſeeds of the ſmall-pox, are chiefly hidden in the Spermatick parts, and that firſt of all, the Contagion lays hold on, for the moſt part, the animal Spirits; hence, the firſt effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency is ſtirred up in the juice, wherewith the Brain, and nervous parts, but eſpecially the Spinal marrow are watered, and from thence the evil is Communicated to the maſs of Blood; wherefore, this Diſeaſe beginning, the Head and Loins are tormented with cruel pain; afterwards, the venom being tranſlated into the Blood, the Feaveriſh effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency is ſtirred up in the whole.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="142" facs="tcp:152521:77"/>3. Great anxiety, and unquietneſs, and ſomtimes a ſwooning, infeſt the ſick, <hi>viz.</hi> by reaſon of the perturbed motion of the Blood, as alſo its equal mixture, beginning to be ſolved, by the Poyſonous ferment, the Blood from thence being apt to ſtagnate in the Heart, and to be hindred in its Circuit, cauſes theſe affections to be thus excited.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Cruel Vomiting, alſo when the Ventricle is free from an impure ballaſt of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, very often accompanies this Diſeaſe; the reaſon of which is, becauſe the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative ſeeds, being ſtirred up into motion, by the little Arteries gaping into the Coates of the Ventricle, are depoſed by every appulſe of the Blood, and raiſe up Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, as if the particles of ſtibium had been ſwallowed; but afterwards, aſſoon as ſweating being procured, the Poyſon is driven forth outwardly, this Symptom ceaſes, and the ſick are well in their ſtomach, without any purging forth of the noxious matter.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. With theſe may be ranked, the Symptoms which ſhew themſelves, according to the various habitudes of the Body, after a diverſe manner, as heavy ſleepineſs, terrors in ſleep, deliriums, tremblings, and convulſions, ſneezing, heat, redneſs, a ſenſe of prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the whole Body, involuntary tears, a ſparkling and itching of the eyes, a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor or ſwelling up of the face, a vehemency of Symptoms from the beginning, that the Diſeaſe ſeems preſently to have attained its ſtrength: the reaſon of all which, may eaſily be elucidated, if what hath been already ſaid, concerning the Symptoms of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, be obſerved; with reſpect to the diverſe tempers of the ſick, their habit, and age, as alſo the condition of the year.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As to the Prognoſis of this Diſeaſe, by the Symtomatick ſigns, it is indicated to be either ſalutary, or mortal, or of a doubtful Event.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The buſineſs promiſes well, when this Diſeaſe has benign circumſtances; to wit, when it happens in a good conſtitution of the Air and Year, at what time the ſmall-pox are leſs malignant and peſtilential; as in the year 1654, at <hi>Oxford,</hi> about Autumn, the ſmall-pox ſpread abundantly, yet very many eſcaped with them: but before, in the year 1649. this Diſeaſe was more rare, yet moſt dyed of it. Alſo, there is leſs danger, if it ſhould happen in the age of Childhood, or Infancy, or in a ſanguine temper, and good habit of Body, or in a Family, to whoſe Anceſtors, the ſmall-pox have not proved mortal: Beſides, if in the whole courſe of the Diſeaſe, the Symptoms prove laudable, if in the firſt aſſault, there be a gentle Feaver, without cruel Vomiting, Swooning, Delirium, or other horrid Diſtempers; if the Feaver about the fourth day be allayed, with the Symptoms chiefly urging, and then ſome little red ſpots begin to appear: if on the ſecond day, of the coming forth of thoſe little red ſpot, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more conſpicuous, which afterwards grow together by degrees into little Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and are ripened into matter; if about the tenth day, or thereabouts, after the eruption, the white tumors begin to ſcab, and by little and little from thence to fall off: if after their firſt coming forth, the ſmall-pox are ſoft, diſtinct, few, round, ſharp pointed, lying only towards the skin, and not in the inward parts, you may be confident the ſick will do very well, and is in a good condition.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The appearances, which in the ſmall-pox, ſignifie the buſineſs to be ſuſpected, and full of danger are of this ſort: if there be a malignant conſtitution of the Air that this Diſeaſe becomes Peſtilential, and that many die of it: if men of more ripe years, or middle age, be taken with it; if it happens in a cold and melancholick tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or in an impure or evil humoured Body, where the Blood is not rightly circulated, nor tranſpiration truly performed; or if the Hypochondria, or Precordia are obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, ſome of the Viſcera infirm, or troubled with an Ulcer, or if the habit of the Body be too fat, the ſmall-pox happen not without great danger of life; nor is it leſs to be feared, when preſently after the beginning, a great Feaver, cruel Vomiting, Swooning, a dejection of ſtrength, Phrenſie or Delirium, come upon them, and that theſe deſiſt not, upon the full coming forth of the ſmall-pox, for theſe ſignifie a too great perturbation in the Blood and humours; alſo, a confuſion and contumacy of the morbifick matter, which can neither be ſubdued, nor eaſily ſeparated from the maſs of Blood, or equally extruded from it: if there be an anxiety, and great unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs, with an inordinate boyling up, and growing hot of the Blood; alſo a great thirſt, a difficulty of breathing, alſo a flux of the Belly, or Dyſentery, they ſhew that ſweating is hindred, and that the malignant humours, reſtagnate towards the inward parts: The ſmall-pox breaking forth ſlowly, argue the crudity, and untameableneſs of the matter, and the impotency of Nature, and tis much more a ſign, if they come forth double, and continued, in too exceſſive a quantity, and confuſion, and alſo if
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:152521:77"/>
there be a diſordered expulſion, and irregular, of that matter, when not in certain iſſues, but every where undiſtinguiſhable. The pox being hard, ſignifie the incoction of the ſame matter, being depreſſed, a weak expulſion; and they are the worſe, if in the midſt of them appear black ſpots; or if purple ſpots familiar to the Feaver, or the Plague, are ſprinkled among the pox, they indicate a great malignity, and putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Blood, ſuch as is wont to be found in the Peſtilence. Laſtly, the pox being black, livid, or green, are of an evil omen, becauſe, beſides the coagulations of the Blood, they argue its deadlineſſes, and corruptions, as in a Gangreen, or peſtilent Plague ſore; if when the ſmall-pox being come forth, they preſently grow dry, and the ſwelling of the parts remit, it ſhews a going back of the malignant matter, or of the congealed Blood, with the Poyſon, and a reſtagnation of it to the inward parts; from whence unleſs a more free Diaphoreſis or ſweating be excited, that it may be thruſt forth of doors again, death for the moſt part quickly follows: For from hence, the Blood being more coagulated, enters into putrefaction, alſo it is apt to be hindred in its motion, and to ſtagnate in the heart, and Veſſels. If after the coming forth of the ſmall-pox, a flux of the Belly, or a Bleeding at noſe, comes upon them, it is an evil ſign, becauſe, by this means, the Venom driven outwardly, is again called back inwardly; but ſomtimes I have obſerved theſe Symptoms to have hapned, with great eaſe to the ſick, <hi>viz.</hi> Nature being before oppreſſed, and burthened; after this manner, part of the burthen being as it were detracted, ſhe was eaſed; wherefore, ſhe buckled her ſelf to the work of ſweating, and more readily expedited the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the noxious matter.</p>
                     <p>As to the Curative part, ſince the ſtadium or courſe of this Diſeaſe, hath three ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as it were ſo many meaſures, diſtinct one from another, the Curative intentions ought to be accommodated to each of theſe; wherefore the Curative method con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſmall-pox, teacheth firſt, what is to be done ſo long as the Blood boyles up, and grows hot inwardly, with the motion of the fermentative matter, and before the ſmall-pox appear, which period for the moſt part is finiſhed, in four or five days.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, what means or manner of Dyet and Phyſick is to be inſtituted, after the coming forth of the ſmall-pox, until the ſtate or ſtanding of the Diſeaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> whilſt the whelks or pox come to the height, and being fully ſuppurated or ripened, begin to dry. Thirdly and laſtly, what we muſt obſerve in the declining of the Diſeaſe, even whilſt the ſmall-pox growing dry, fall off.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, let the intention be, that we may carry away every impediment of Nature, whereby the Blood being infected by the ferment of the Small-pox, and apt to be coagulated, may yet retain an equal motion in the Heart, and without ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the Veſſels, and growing hot, may expel forth of doors the congealed por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the Poyſon; in the mean time, there muſt be a caution, leaſt the work of fermentation or growing hot be any ways hindred, or too much provoked; for by this, the maſs of the Blood is agitated into congealed portions, more than it ought to be; by that other, it is reſtrained too much, in its motion, nor are the invenomed Particles ſent forth of doors, with the congealed Blood; Nature in the work of ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and expulſion, is wont to be hindred, by too great an heap of excrements in the Viſcera, or by the abundance of Blood in the Veſſels; wherefore, upon the firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault of the Diſeaſe, care muſt be taken, that if need be, an evacuation by Vomit or Stool, be timely procured; but only more mild Purges, and gentle, are to be uſed, which do not too much provoke, or diſturb the Humors: wherefore, at this time, Purges, Emetics, or Clyſters, now theſe, now thoſe, take place; alſo the letting of Blood, if there be a fulneſs, is performed with good ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>During this growing hot of the Blood, dyet ought to be inſtituted ſlender and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately cooling, <hi>viz.</hi> Barly-Broth, or Grewel of Oatmeal, Poſſet-drink, Small Beer or the like: Fleſh, and Fleſh Broths are to be avoided, whereby the Blood, by reaſon of the too great plenty of Sulphureous Food, may be inkindled more than it ought; alſo all cold, and ſharp or acid things are hurtful: for theſe congeal the Blood more, and contract the little mouths of the Veſſels, by their aſtriction or binding Nature, that the Small-pox come forth leſs freely; alſo hot things, and Cordials are cautiouſly to be adminiſtred, for by theſe the Blood and Humors are too much agitated, and driven into confuſion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When the Small-pox begin to appear, there are three things, which by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Rule we preſcribe to be performed, to every ſick perſon; to wit, that a ſoft and gentle Sweat be ſtill continued in the Blood; alſo, that the Throat and Eyes may be preſerved, from a too great eruption of the Small-pox. That the Blood lightly grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot may emit the Small-pox, decoctions of Figs, Marigold flowers, and ſhavings
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:152521:78"/>
of Harts-Horn in Poſſet-drink, are commonly preſcribed, and the uſe of them is general for a long time, almoſt with all people; for the ſame intention, we are wont ſomtimes in a day, to give them moderate Cordials; but the more hot and ſtrong are carefully to be ſhunned; Purging and Blood letting here are moſt wickedly enterpriſed, and theſe tho neceſſity compelled, Phyſicians dare not meddle with for fear of blame: For to defend the Throat and Gutteral parts, we put on the outer skin, a defence of Saffron dipped in Breaſt Milk, and ſowed in a Rag; for theſe, by opening the pores, draw away the venom outwardly, from the moſt inward part of the Throat; alſo for this end, we adminiſter Gargariſms, and things to waſh the mouth, which by their reſtriction, reſtrain the coming forth of the Small-pox withing: we defend the Eyes, with peculiar Medicines, of Roſe-water, and Breaſt Milk, with Saffron, and ſuch like, frequently iterated, from the incurſion of the Small-pox: Beſides theſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times certain moſt horrid ſymptoms do trouble, which muſt be timely helped with convenient Remedies; ſomtimes there are preſent, Watchings, Phrenſie, Bleeding at Noſe, Vomiting, Looſneſs, and a falling back of the Small-pox: for theſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others, as occaſion ariſes, a prudent Phyſician knows how to provide; in which however there is need of great caution, leaſt whilſt we take care of the ſmaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the great work of Nature ſhold be diſturbed by a too great moleſtation of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. For in all this time there is one, and a continued Criſis: wherefore nothing is to be meddled with raſhly. There is required the moſt care and circumſpection of the Phyſician and Nurſes, or thoſe that adminiſter to the ſick, when this Diſeaſe is at its height or ſtanding, <hi>viz.</hi> leaſt that when the Small-pox be fully come forth, and brought to their greateſt height, tranſpiration ſhould be hindered; for then the ſick are in danger of renewing the Feaver, and of the reſtagnation of the Malignant matter within, whilſt we ſtudy to prevent the one, we for the moſt part bring on the other.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When the Diſeaſe ſhall be in its declination, and the Small-pox begin to wither and Scab, the buſineſs for the moſt part is out of danger, nor is there much need of a Phyſician: let the ſick, tho he grow very hungry content himſelf ſtill with a ſlender dyet, and without fleſh: if the Scabs fall off ſlowly, we are wont to ripen them with Lineaments, and peculiar Medicines, to make them fall, and care ſhould be taken that they leave not behind them too great pits: after the ſick having the Scabs every where fallen off, and are able to riſe and walk about the Chamber, the filthy Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious matter in the Bowels, is to be carried away, by two or three times Purging, and then they may be permitted to uſe a more plentiful and ſtronger dyet.</p>
                     <p>The Meaſles are ſo much akin to the Small-pox, that with moſt Authors, they have not deſerved to be handled apart from them, but that either diſtemper have been treated of together, after the like manner and method. The eſſence and cure differ at leaſt accidentally, or as they are greater or leſſer; becauſe in the Meaſles the whealks riſe not up to ſo great a bulk, neither are they ſuppuritated; wherefore the ſickneſs is ſooner ended and with leſs danger. This diſtemper is wont moſtly to ſpread upon children, more rarely among thoſe of years, or old men, alſo thoſe who firſt have had the Small-pox, are not afterwards ſo obnoxious to the Meaſles, but in moſt things, either diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per are of kin, <hi>viz.</hi> the evil being contracted in the Womb, diſpoſes men only, and all men once, to the Meaſles; the malignant conſtitution of the Air, and ſomtimes a ſurfeit, and moſt often the contagion, are wont to bring the hidden diſpoſition into act: there are preſent marks of malignity, and the ſickneſs oftentimes becomes Epidemical, and with mortality and contagion.</p>
                     <p>That I may briefly contract the ſum of the matter: it ſeems that the Meaſles are a certain lighter flowring, of on extraneous ferment, contracted from the Womb; by which, ſome Particles being ſtirred up into motion, make the Blood lightly to grow hot, and to be a little coagulated: wherefore the marks from thence ſpread abroad, are diſſipated without any breaking of the Cuticula, or outward skin, by evaporation only: but the Small-pox are a more full and ſtrong agitation, according to all the Particles of the ſame ferment, which cauſing a greater ebullition and coagulation of the Blood, produces far more full whelks, and greater in bulk, and not to be diſſolved, but by ſuppuration, or growing into matter: when the Small-pox preceed, they are not only exempt from the ſame diſeaſe any more, but alſo from the Meaſles, becauſe they conſume only ſome of the Particles of the ferment, leave ſtill a diſpoſition to the Small-pox; wherefore old men, or thoſe of years, are not ſo readily infected with the Meaſles, becauſe they are either freed from the contagion, by having before had the Small-pox, or elſe the infection of this more light Diſeaſe, is eaſily reſiſted by their more ſtrong Spirits.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="145" facs="tcp:152521:78"/>It were eaſie to illuſtrate the afore-recited Doctrine, concerning the Small Pox, with Hiſtories and Obſervations of the ſick, becauſe there is no Diſeaſe beſides can ſupply with a greater plenty of Examples, or variety of Accidents: but of the great number of this kind, I ſhall only propoſe in this place a few Caſes, and thoſe remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for ſome irregularities.</p>
                     <p>It is a uſual thing to handle all that are ſick of the Small Pox, with a like, or whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame method of Curing, and manner of Dyet; wherefore, a Phyſician is rarely ſent for to the common ſort, but the buſineſs is wholly committed to ſome women, profeſſing themſelves skilful in this Diſeaſe: and theſe are wont to boyl in their broths, and all the ſuppings of the ſick, Marigold Flowers, ſhaving of Harts-horn, and ſometimes Figs; alſo every night to adminiſter a Bolus of Diaſcordium: and they who grow not well by this kind of Government, tho not neglected, yet are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be incurable, by reaſon of the cruelty of the Diſeaſe. But truly this kind of practice is not convenient for all alike, nor to be adminiſtred to every one indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, as theſe two following Hiſtories will make manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>A Young Man, about 20 years of Age, of a ſlender body, and more hot tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, began to be feaveriſh in the beginning of the Spring, at firſt cruel Vomitings, an oppreſſion of the heart, and frequent changes of heat and ſhivering, a pain in his Loyns, a diſturbance of his fancy and wakings infeſted him: on the third day, the Small Pox appearing, thoſe ſymptoms remitted, but ſtill the Feaver, with heat and thirſt continued. Not only the accuſtomed Decoctions in this Diſeaſe, but alſo a moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Julep, of a moſt grateful taſte, were ſo nauſeous and troubleſome to him, that he would not ſo much as taſte the ſame, but with a great deal of trouble: as often as he took going to ſleep, Diaſcordium, or any other more temperate Cordial, for the continuing his ſweat, tho in a very little quantity, the night following he was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſleep, and in great diſquiet; and then in the beginning of the morning a bleeding followed, by which means, indeed, the Small Pox being full come forth, the Life of the ſick was in great danger, by reaſon of this occaſion happening once or twice; wherefore, when I had found by obſervation, his blood apt to grow immoderately hot, by ſo light a provocation, I inſtituted this method as occaſion ſerved. All Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines being let alone, he took for the quenching his thirſt ſmall beer, and ſimple Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Drink, at his pleaſure: for his food, becauſe he vomited back all Oatmeal Grewel, or Barly Broth, he eat only apples roaſted tender, and dreſt with ſuggar and roſe water, often in a day. Nature being contented with this ſlender ordering, and being ſeen to be diſturbed with any other thing, performed happily its work, that the ſick perſon grew well, without any grievous ſymptom afterwards, the Small Pox from thence ripening, and then of their own accord falling off.</p>
                     <p>In the middle of the Autumn, of the former Year, a Gentile Young Man, being indued with a ſharp Blood, and obnoxious to a frequent bleeding at Noſe, fell ſick of the Small Pox; his Blood of its own accord grew immoderately hot, that the whealks very quickly broke forth over all his Body: Poſſet Drink, with Marigold Flowers, and other uſual things boyled in it, alſo Juleps, or any Cordials, tho tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and gently provoking ſweat, moſt certainly ſtirr'd up a Flux of Blood in this Perſon; wherefore I ordered the like manner of Dyet, as in the ſick Perſon before cited, by which he found himſelf better, however, in the very ſtate or ſtanding of the Diſeaſe, (when the Small Pox being fully come forth, by reaſon of a more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult tranſpiration, the Feaver is wont to be ſomewhat renewed in all) this ſick Man fell into a moſt plentiful bleeding; that after a large profuſion of Blood, the Small Pox began to flagg or fall: After that Remedies, very many, were tryed in vain, for the ſtaying of the Blood, at length a little Bag being hung about his Neck (in which was a Toad dryed in the Sun, and bruiſed) he firſt, and immediately perceived eaſe; tho the bleeding was by this means ſtayed, and not any more returning, (whilſt he conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wore this peculiar Medicine in his Boſom) our ſick Man ſtill uſing a moſt thin and cooling Dyet, grew quite well; that indeed from hence it may appear, that altho the Blood in this Diſtemper, is apt to be greatly coagulated, yet ſo long as the Vital Spirits, being ſtrong and robuſt, are able ſufficiently to execute their government, they indeavouring by their proper ſtrength or forces, do beſt of all ſeparate and thruſt forth the congealed portions of the Blood, as it were by a certain skilful ſeparation; and this work is moſt of all hindred, when the ſame ſpirits are too much irritated by Cordials, or more hot food, and agitated into confuſion: But in the Plague it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens otherwiſe, becauſe in this, if any delay be granted, the Spirits themſelves are
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:152521:79"/>
preſently profligated by the venom; wherefore, here they muſt fight cloſe and quick, when in the Small Pox, the Phyſician does his buſineſs better by delay.</p>
                     <p>Concerning letting of Blood, at the inſtant breaking out of the Small Pox, it is very dubious: formerly, among our Countrimen, this was eſteemed a wicked buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, neither were they wont to admit of Phlebotomy under any pretext of neceſſity: but of late, experience having taught us, in ſome caſes, it is found, that to let Blood hath been wholly profitable and neceſſary; which evacuation however, if it ſhould be adminiſtred indifferently in every conſtitution, or when this need ſhould be, it ſhould be performed in too large a quantity, by that means oftentimes very great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage ariſes.</p>
                     <p>Some years before, I viſited a young Gentlewoman, of a ſtorid countenance, and more hot temperature, growing into a Feaver, after the fourth month of her being with Child: ſhe was troubled with a cruel vomiting, a moſt cruel pain of the Loyns, beſides with moſt ſtrong heat and thirſt: her pulſe was ſwift, with a ſtrong and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement vibration or beating: altho the Small Pox had never been in that place, yet theſe ſymptoms gave no light ſuſpicion of this Diſeaſe; however, its great efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency indicated that Blood ſhould be taken away; wherefore I took away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix ounces preſently, upon which the heat remitted ſomwhat, yet the vomiting, with a cruel pain in the Loyns, remained ſtill: At the hour of ſleep I gave her a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial Bolus, with half a grain of our Laudanum, by which means quiet ſleep follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a pleaſant ſweat, and an allaying of all the ſymptoms: the next morning the Small Pox came forth, with which, altho the ſick Gentlewoman was greatly diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, yet ſhe grew well without any dangerous ſickneſs, or fear of miſcarrying, and went out her full time.</p>
                     <p>The laſt Autumn, a ſtrong Man, of an active and robuſt conſtitution of body, yet of a pale countenance, and more cold temper, fell into a Feaver: on the ſecond day he was tormented with heat and thirſt, and a moſt cruel pain in his Loyns: when I had preſcribed Blood to be taken in a ſmall quantity, the unskilful Chirurgion, who was ſent for, took from him almoſt half a pound; a little after, the ſick man began to be all over in a cold ſweat, on a ſudden to looſe all ſtrength, to be troubled with a ſhivering, a weak Pulſe and unequal, and frequent ſwooning: At this time being ſent for, I gave him a temperate Cordial, to be taken frequently. His Spirits and Pulſe being thereby reſtored, the Feaver was renewed, which afterwards, for ſome days, yea, weeks, exerciſed the ſick man, after a very irregular manner; for he was wont for three or four days, to grow very hot, alſo to be infeſted with thirſt, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, headach, and other ſymptoms, then to be troubled all over with a copious and critical ſweat, by which indeed for half a days ſpace he found himſelf better: But from thence, the Feaver ſtill growing worſe, heaped together again new matter, till it was diſperſed by another Criſis, and then another. After that he had been thus feaveriſh, for at leaſt twenty days irregularly, at length the Small Pox began to come forth, in ſeveral parts of his Body, here and there, and then the Feaver wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; yet within few days, by reaſon of ſome errors committed in his Dyet, very many of the whealks began to fall down again, few of them only being brought to maturity: However, inſtead of the ſubſiding Small Pocks, a mighty Bubo grew up behind his right Ear; from which, being ſoon ripened, and broke, a great plenty of matter flowed forth for many days, and ſo at length the corruptions of the Blood, unable otherways to be diſſipated, were carried forth by degrees, and the ſick Perſon recovered perfect Health.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of Feavers of Child-bearing Women.</head>
                     <p>VUlgar Experience abundantly teſtifies, that the Feavers of Women lying in are very dangerous, beyond the diſpoſition of other common Feavers: alſo that the ſame differ very much, as to their eſſence, from both a ſimple and putrid Synochus, plainly appears from their ſigns and ſymptoms rightly weigh'd: wherefore, I believe it not to be from the matter, to handle after malignant Feavers, the acute Diſeaſes of Women lying in, being exceeding neer of kin to thoſe, for their mortality or perniciouſneſs. Yet, before I ſhall enter upon the unfolding theſe Diſeaſes, it behoves us to conſider their ſubjects, <hi>viz.</hi> the Bodies of Women in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, after what manner they are prediſpoſed, and by what proviſion they are made obnoxious to theſe kind of ſickneſſes.</p>
                     <p>Concerning this, the firſt thing that offers itſelf, is, that the Flux of the menſtruous Blood, is wholly convenient to be ſuffered by human kind, and at this time for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, concerning whoſe nature and original we ſhall not inquire in this place; but it ſhall ſuffice to note, that in them, the particles of the Blood, to be periodically thruſt forth, are very Permentative; which, if reteined in the Body, beyond the wonted manner of Nature, are very often the cauſe of many Diſeaſes: unleſs only when a Woman conceives with Child. For all the time of her being big Bellied, the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Flowers are ſtopped without any incommodiouſneſs; and in the mean time, milk, or the alible juice, is diſpoſed in great plenty, about the parts of the Womb, for the nouriſhment of the Child: but after the Birth, this daily ſuppreſſion of the monthly Flowers, is recompenſed by a copious flowing forth of the Lochia, or what comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way after the Birth; and the milk within three days having wholly left the Womb, ſprings forth plentifully into the Breaſts: at which time, Women lying in, are wont to be troubled with a ſmall Feaver. If that the milk be driven away from the Breaſts, it reſtagnates again towards the Womb, and is thruſt forth, together with the Lochia, under the form of a whitiſh humour. In the mean time, the Womb, after the Birth, becomes ſubject to various diſtempers; for oftentimes, its tone is hurt, the unity is diſſolved, and many other accidents are induced, which render Women lying in ſubject to danger: wherefore, that their acute Diſeaſes may be rightly unfolded, it is convenient, for to conſider chiefly theſe three things, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, the nouriſhment of the Child, or the Generation of Milk, both in the Womb, and in the Dugs, and the metaſtaſis or tranſlation of it from one to another. Secondly, the purging of the Mothers Blood, or the profluvium of the Lochia, after a long ſuppreſſion of the Menſtrua. Thirdly, the condition of the Womb after the Birth, and its influence on other parts of the Body. And theſe being premiſed, we will ſpeak of the Feavers of Women lying in, <hi>viz.</hi> both the milkie, and the putrid, called, and that deſervedly, malignant, by reaſon of its deadlineſs.</p>
                     <p>Firſt the Milk, and nouriſhing humour, being heaped up in the parts of the Womb, for the nouriſhment of the Child, are of a like nature, tho ſomewhat different in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency. Milk is indeed more thick, becauſe it ought to be received in at the mouth, and to be kept in the Ventricle, and afterwards it more thin portion to be conveyed to the maſs of Blood. The other alible Juice is more thin, and like the water of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled Milk, becauſe 'tis immediately poured into the Blood of the Embryo, thorow the umbilick Veſſels, without any previous digeſtion. Either Juice is ſuppoſed to come from the Chyle freſh made in the mothers ſtomach; what is repoſed, or laid up in the Breaſt, is more thick and white, by reaſon of the more thin or open ſtrainer, and coction in the greater Glandulas; on the contrary, it happens in the Womb o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otherwiſe, where the Glandulas are ſmaller, and the Straining more cloſe. But there is a great diſagreement among Authors, concerning the paſſages, by which this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is carried, both in the Breaſts, and into the Cake of the Womb. Some contend, that Milk only is begotten of the Blood, more plentifully cocted in the Glandulas, which yet, by reaſon of the immenſe diſpenſe of Milk, which conſiſts not with the Blood, this ſeems not probable. Others affirm, that the Chyle, or Milkie humor,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:152521:80"/>
is immediately conveyed from the Viſcera of Concoction, thorow occult paſſages, without any alteration, into either receptacles. But in the mean time, while theſe paſſages lie open, it ſeems indeed to me more likely, that from the meat taken into the Mothers Stomach, a portion of the Chyle thence made, is preſently ſupped up into the Veins, which having obtained the vehicle of the Blood, before it be aſſimilated by it, is ſaid up in the Glandulas, deſtinated here and there for the receiving of it, being carried by the Arteries, and laſtly ſeparated from the maſs of Blood; for as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that drink being plentifully taken, preſently paſſes thorow the whole maſs of Blood, and is rendered by Urine like water: and as old Ulcers, by means of the Blood coming between, prey upon the nutritious humor, from the whole Body, and pour it forth under the ſhape of a putrified matter, Why may not the alible Juice in like manner, being ſtrained by the Collander of the Glandulas, before it has indued the colour of Blood, go into a Milkie humour? This indeed ſeems more probable, becauſe, whilſt the Milk is carried from the Womb into the Breaſts, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, paſſing thorow the maſs of Blood, it is wont to ſtir up a perturbation thorow the whole, with a feaveriſh intemperance; beſides, in the firſt days, after the Birth, when the Glandulas do leſs rightly perform the office of ſecretion: Beaſts, who have not the Lochia, give a bloody Milk, which is drawn forth of their Udders, that is, mixt with Blood, by reaſon of the plenty of it flowing forth together.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As to what belongs to the Menſtrua being ſuppreſſed, in the time of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Child, and the Lochia plentifully coming away, after being Delivered, we ſay that after the Conception of the Child, the Menſtrua ought to be ſuppreſſed by Divine Deſignation, for that the flowing of them often cauſes abortion; then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Veſſels are filled by a continual ſtilling forth of the alible juice into the parts of the Womb, the maſs of the Blood doth not ariſe into ſwellings up to be allayed by the menſtruous Flux. For the ſame reaſon, Women for the moſt part, have not their courſes ſo long as they give ſuck. Perhaps in ſome, indued with a more hot Blood, the monthly courſes flow, both whilſt they are Big-bellied, and in the time of their giving ſuck, but that more rarely, and is wont not to happen without trouble; yet in the mean time, the Menſtrua being ſuppreſſed, during the time of being with Child, becauſe much leſs of the nutritious humor is expended at that time for Milk, they much more deprave the Blood, than the ſame being reſtrained at the time of ſuckling the Child, are wont to do: yea, from them being long ſuppreſſed, in the former condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an, as it were, envenomed taint is impreſſed on the maſs of Blood, which, unleſs it be purged forth by the daily Flux of the Lochia, preſently after being brought to Bed, produces grievous, and almoſt malignant Diſtempers. Wherefore, that I may give my opinion of the flowing of the Lochia, I ſay, that this bleeding proceeds immediately from the Veſſels being broken, by which the after-Birth did ſtick to the Womb, and that by this way, the excrementitious Blood and humors, being partly heaped up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Womb during the time of being with Child, and partly flowing from the whole maſs of the Blood, are evacuated, <hi>viz.</hi> whilſt the Womb at firſt intumified in its bulk, falls down preſently after the Birth, and is contracted into a leſſer ſpace, the Blood is plentifully preſſed forth, from the Veſſels opening into it. But beſides, foraſmuch as during the ſuppreſſion of the courſes, the bloody maſs is imbued with very fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Particles, as ſoon as after the Birth, the mouths of the Veſſels are opened, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as it were at the inſtant of a more large Flux of monthly courſes, the whole Blood grows hot (even as Muſt or new Wine upon the opening the Bottle) and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to purge forth the highly fermentative particles, out of its boſom, by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the Lochia, as it were the flowring: And therefore, beſides the Blood, which in the firſt days, oftentimes flows pure, by reaſon of the freſh opening of the Veſſels, afterwards is ſifted forth matter very much diſcoloured, <hi>viz.</hi> livid and green, and this very ſtinking, This kind of Flux is wont to continue, at leaſt for 14 days, yea, in ſome for a month; and if that by reaſon of any error, it be ſtopped before the maſs of Blood be throughly purified, by ſuch flowring, preſently a Feaver, very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, with horrid proviſions of ſymptoms, is wont to be induced: of which we ſhall ſpeak anon in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>The third conſideration, previous to the Doctrine of Feavers, belonging to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in Child-bed, is chiefly about the Womb it ſelf; to wit, how it is affected after Child-bearing, and what influence it has on other parts of the Body. As to the firſt, there are chiefly two accidents, upon which the acute Diſeaſes of Women in Child-bed very much depend, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, The falling down of the Womb, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:152521:80"/>
of it, from the bulk of ingravidation, to its natural ſite and magnitude: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the ſolution of the unity, within its cavity, by reaſon of the breaking of the connexion, or tying to the cake of it, or after-Birth. When the Child, with what wraps it about, is put forth, preſently the ſides of the Womb it ſelf, before very much amplified or enlarged, do mutually cloſe, and by the help of the Fibres, leiſurely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract themſelves into a narrower ſpace; by reaſon of this kind of contraction, the Blood and Corruptions, or matter, are plentifully preſſed forth, from the Veſſels and Pores of the Womb, and are thruſt forth with the Lochia. But ſometimes it happens, by reaſon of ſome preternatural things conteined in the Womb, as part of the ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine or after Birth, a Mole or piece of Fleſh, clodders of Blood, &amp;c. alſo, if there happen after a painful Birth, a Contuſion or great Dilaceration, that the Womb can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rightly draw it ſelf together, but by an inverſe motion of the Fibres, aſcends upwards, and is lifted up into a bulk; alſo the membranes being affected with a Convulſion, it ſelf is ſtill tormented with torments, as if it were yet in Travel; which kind of Diſtempers, if they long continue, by reaſon of the Orifite of the Womb being tied together, with the Convulſive motion, the Lochia are oftentimes ſtopped alſo: from hence grievous ſymptoms follow, and very often the Feaver is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther firſt excited, or it happens, being for ſome other cauſe induced, to be rendred far more dangerous. Secondly, as to the ſolution of the unity, from the cake of the Womb being broken, it comes to paſs, that the Birth, either at its juſt time, or preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitous, being too much haſtened; then the ſecundine is caſt forth, either whole, or being torn, or pull'd away, part of it being left behind, it is cut off as it were in half. If the Child be born at its juſt time, and the Birth, with what inwraps it, comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the cavity of the Womb, as ripe fruit from a Tree, whole, and without violence, the mouths of the Veſſels are ſomewhat unlocked, and the Lochia mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately flow; but from hence no grievous ſymptom is to be feared: but if the Child, not being yet ripe for the Birth, is pulled away, or breaks forth as it were by force, although the Cake, with the membrane is pulled away whole, yet the Veſſels being torn, a greater hemorrhage or bleeding, and at length an Ulcerous diſpoſition fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, the little mouths of the Veſſels ſpewing forth a ſtinking matter. If that part, or the whole ſecundine ſticks to the ſides of the Womb, after the Birth, it there pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifies, and ſends forth very ſtinking matter or corruption, and ſtirs up wicked diſtempers: oftentimes the Orifice of the Womb is ſhut up, and retains within gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets of clodder'd Blood, little pieces of Membranes, or Fleſh, which putrifying, by reaſon of the heat, impoyſon the Blood and humors, flowing together to that place, by Circulation, from the whole body; alſo, by a troubleſome itching or provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they ſtir up the parts of the Womb, being ſo very ſenſible, into Convulſions.</p>
                     <p>When therefore hurt is brought to the Womb, from Child-bearing, after the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ways, the ſame is quickly communicated to other parts, not without trouble to the whole body; which thing indeed is wont to be done by a double means. For firſt, this happens, becauſe the Lochia being hindred from being thruſt forth, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently reſtagnate or flow back upon the maſs of Blood, and infect it as it were with a virulent taint: moreover, from the contents putrifying in the Womb, either the ſubſtance it ſelf of the matter, or the Particles coming away from the cadaverous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, are mingled with the Blood, and nervous juice, paſſing thorow that place, and quickly infect their whole liquors. Secondly, hyſterical Diſtempers, are more largely extended, by reaſon of the notable conſent, which happens between the Womb and the Brain, with the Fibres and Membranes of the whole body, by the means of the nervous paſſage: for when the extremities of the Nerves, planted about the parts of the Womb, are driven into Cramps and Convulſive motions, by reaſon of the preſence of ſome hurtful humor, the Convulſions there received, preſently creep more largely upwards, by the indeavours and circumduction of the Nerves, towards the Brain; and ſo it happens, to the Viſcera to be ſucceſſively inflated, and cruelly haled together, and the Brain it ſelf at length to be pierced, and its functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be as it were overwhelmed: hence, from the convulſive motions, ariſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Womb, an inflation of the Belly, and hypochondria, a rumbling, vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſobbing, and ſtreightneſs of the Praecordia, difficult breathing, a ſenſe of choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and oftentimes a ſtupor, and want of ſpeech, or at leaſt ſome of theſe are excited: nor does the Tragedy to eaſily leave, but that alſo the Brain being hurt, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the diſtemper, by that means, the evil is retorted upon other parts, that oftentimes the whole nervous ſtock is compelled into irregularities of motions; For
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:152521:81"/>
what commonly is ſaid to be done by vapours, and the diſtemper, called the aſcent of vapours, creeping from the nether parts, to the upper, is nothing elſe than the parts of the Membranes, and nervous paſſages, being ſucceſſively driven into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions. Further, in theſe ſort of diſtempers, the hurt action doth not always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, or is at firſt perceived, in that region or place where the hurt is inflicted, neither do the paſſions which are called hyſterical, proceed only from the Womb; for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, the trouble is immediately brought from the Brain, or the Convulſions and Contractions begin in the extreme parts, and ſometimes the extremities of the Nerves, ſomewhere in the Viſcera, as the Stomach, Spleen, Reins, no leſs than the Womb, are haled; in which, irregularities being ariſen, they are continued into the neighbouring part, and from thence to the Brain: From whence again, the Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are reflected to other parts, and not ſeldom thorow the whole Body. Juſt ſo the buſineſs in Child-bearing Women, and with others in Feavers, as I have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; to wit, ſome by reaſon of their Womb being evilly affected, but others by reaſon of a Feaveriſh matter fixed in the Brain, by a critical metaſtaſis or tranſlation, fall into paſſions like to the hyſterical. And theſe things being rightly prepenſed, concerning the praevious proviſion, in the Feavers of Women in Child-bed, there is not any thing that we ſhould ſtick at in the entrance more, ſo that we take notice that the bodies of Women lying in, (eſpecially thoſe who are feeble, and of a more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſtitution) are debilitated, chiefly after a difficult and hard Labour; ſo that, by reaſon of this occaſion only, they eaſily conceive feaveriſh intemperatures, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought in by this or any other means, they are hardly able to bear them. We will next ſpeak of the Feavers themſelves, with which Women Lying in are wont to be ſick, of which Diſtempers there are commonly recounted as it were three kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> the Milkie Feaver, the Putrid, the Symptomatic, or of that manner by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain borrowed ſymptom, but is chiefly marked with the Pleuriſie, Squinancy or the Small-Pox: of which we will diſcourſe in order.</p>
                     <div type="part">
                        <head>The Milkie Feaver.</head>
                        <p>WE have already ſaid, that as yet it was uncertain of what matter Milk was immediately made, and by what paſſages it is carried into the Breaſts, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over when this part appears not at all to anatomical inſpection, I am of the opinion, that the Milkie Chyme, being made out of aliments in the Bowels, and from thence confuſed to the Blood for nouriſhing juice, is preſently again, for the moſt part of it, ſeparated from its maſs by the help of the Glandulas in the Womb, or in the Breaſts, that it might ſupply the Child with nutriment, either in the Mothers Belly, or in her boſom by the Breaſts. In the time of going with Child, altho the greateſt part of this is derived to the Womb, yet in the laſt months, a little quantity of it is laid up in the Breaſts; but about the third or fourth day, after being brought to bed, the Milk is more plentifully carried into the Breaſts, and as it were with a certain force, that it quickly fills them to a ſtretching them forth, and begins to be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. At this time, Women lying in (tho not all, yet moſt) are wont to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a feaveriſh intemperature, with thirſt, heat, and an inquietude of the whole Body, they complain of a pain very troubleſome in the Back and Shoulders, of a full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and burning of the Breaſts; and unleſs the Milk be diligently drawn forth, it being too much congeſted or heaped up, oftentimes brings forth an inflamation, with an Impoſthume following of it in the Breaſts. This Feaver, whilſt the Lochia are in good order, hardly laſts three days, but that about that ſpace it is wont to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, a plentiful ſweating ariſing of its own accord: yet this intemperature being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the coming of the Milk, is ſomewhat increaſed and continued longer, if that the Milk entring the Breaſts in abundance, be not milked forth, but is again repelled from thence; for by its departure, as well as by its coming, a perturbation is wont to happen in the whole Body, with thirſt and heat, which alſo more certainly comes to paſs if it happens to be driven away violently, by repelling Topicks. But being driven by their help from the Breaſts, or departing of its own accord, it is thruſt forth, with the Lochia, in the form of a whitiſh humor, and a ſweat, or more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful tranſpiration, exterminates the Reliques of the Diſeaſe. If that with this kind of intemperance, brought in by reaſon of the commotion of the Milk, the Lochia be ſtopped, or errors in eating and drinking be committed, or any other evident cauſe ſhould happen, that may encreaſe the fervor of the Blood, very often the Milkie

Feaver, preſently acquiring worſe ſymptoms, changes into a putrid, or rather ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Feaver.</p>
                        <p>The cauſe, or formal reaſon of the aforeſaid Feaver (whilſt the way of the Milk lies hid) may be only propoſed, from an hypotheſis, and as it were a certain Augury; for being ſuppoſed, that this milky humor is carried to the Breaſts immediately, by a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar paſſage, from the Viſcera of concoction, without any commerce with the Blood, this feaveriſh Diſtemper ariſes, for that the Breaſts being filled with Milk, and greatly diſtended, the ſanguineous Veſſels are ſo compreſſed, that they do not eaſily tranſmit the Blood flowing thither; from whence, the Blood being hindred in its circuit, begins to tumultuate thorow its whole maſs, and the Spirits being inordinately mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and wholly confuſed, it conceives a fervor, ſuch as being induced by a ſtopping, Surfeit, Inflamation, or Wound, conſtitutes ordinarily the ſimple Synochus; but if the matter of the Milk (as it is not improbable) paſſes thorow the Blood, this Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Women in Child-bed, ſeems to ſpring from hence, that when this Latex is transferred to the Breaſts, having left the Womb, a great portion of it ſubſiſts in the maſs of the Blood, which indeed, for that it exceeds the due proviſion of the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing juice, and ſo cannot be wholly aſſimilated, and beſides abounds in heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous parts, and as it were ſomething extraneous, and not mingleable with the Blood, creates a trouble, therefore for the carrying it forth of doors, and putting it forth, this three days feaveriſh Diſtemper is employed: For when the milky Chile, being uſed to be ſeparated about the Womb, by and by, after being Delivered of a Child, that wax of excretion is hindred, reſtagnating into the maſs of Blood, it is there firſt of all heaped up more plentifully, than that the whole may go into nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or be received into the Breaſts: wherefore, the Milk, not only in its paſſage to the Breaſts, but alſo in its return towards the Womb, brings forth the Feaver, to wit, by reaſon of either paſſage thorow the Blood.</p>
                        <p>But however the cauſe of this Diſeaſe is ordained, it matters little or nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Cure; for this is wholly committed to Nature, and ſo long as the Lochia are in good order, it proceeds for the moſt part happily, without any Phyſical help: becauſe, after the growing hot of the Blood, for three or four days, either a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſweat, or a more free tranſpiration, cures this Diſtemper, to wit, either the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Milky humor, degenerate in the aſſimulating, or the aduſt recrements, remaining after the deflagration of the Blood, or both of them at once ſupplying the food or tinder of the Feaver, are by little and little ſubdued, and evaporated out of doors, which being excluded, the Blood becoming free from the extraneous mixture, quickly recovers its priſtine condition; yet in the mean time, certain vulgar Rules are wont to be obſerved, about the admiſſion of the Milk into, or the driving away of the ſame, out of the Breaſts. If the Milk too plentifully ſprings into the Breaſts, that their inflamation, as alſo the immoderate growing hot of the Blood, may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, at that time, a more thin and ſparing dyet, to wit, no fleſh broths, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in a leſs quantity, is to be ordered: alſo the Breaſts are to be frequently drawn. If it be not commodious for the Mother to ſuckle her Child, it is uſual after the firſt or third day of her being Delivered to cover all the Breaſts over with Sear-Cloaths moderately binding (as the Plaiſter of Red-lead, &amp;e.) for ſo the ſpongious ſubſtance of the Glandulas, is ſomewhat conſtrained, or cloſed together, whereby they leſs readily receive the milky humor flowing thither, yet this kind of Remedy ought to be cautiouſly adminiſtred, leſt if the Milk be wholly excluded, or driven out of the Breaſt too abruptly, reſtagnating ſuddenly in the Blood, it induces its diſorder, the prodromus or forerunner of the Putrid or Malignant Feaver: of which it remains that we ſpeak next.</p>

                        <p>WOmen Lying in, from the fault of an evil affected Body, as by the Contagion of a received Peſtilential Air, are found to be too obnoxious to the Putrid, or rather Malignant Feaver; but all do not a like receive the Infection of this ſort of Diſeaſe; for poor people, Labouring Women, Country Women, and others accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to hard Labour, as alſo Viragoes, and Whores, which are brought to Bed clandeſtinely, bring forth without any great difficulty, and then, after a little time, leaving their Beds, return to their wonted Labours: But more rich Women, tender and fair, and moſt living a ſedentary life, as if participating after a more grievous
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:152521:82"/>
manner of the Divine Malediction, bring forth in pain, and then preſently after the Birth they are ſubject to difficult and dangerous chances; the reaſon of which ſeems to lie in this, that thoſe who are uſed to much exerciſe, continually agitate and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilate the Blood, and therefore fewer infectious taints from the monthly Flowers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppreſſed, do gather together for the matter of a Diſeaſe; moreover, laborious and nimble Women, as they have their nervous parts more firm, therefore they are leſs ſubjected to convulſive motions, and to the paſſions commonly called hyſterical: on the contrary, in delicate, and idle Women, the maſs of Blood, in the time of their going with Child, becomes very impure and fermentiſible; beſides, becauſe they have the ſyſtem of the Nerves, and the Brain ſoft and weak, upon every light occaſion, they ſuffer diſtractions of the animal Spirits, and inordinate motions of the nervous parts. And here, by the way, it is to be noted, that Women more than men, and that ſome of the ſame Sex before others, are ſenſible of the affections cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hyſtorical, not ſo much by the default of their Womb, as for that they are of more weak conſtitution of Brain, and nervous ſtock; for in thoſe ſo affected, the paſſions of anger, ſadneſs, fear, as alſo all troubleſome and more ſtrong objects, eaſily pervert the diſpoſitions and functions of thoſe parts, which, when they are once hurt, for the moſt part afterwards, are accuſtomed to thoſe irregularities. But we will return from whence we have digreſſed. The Feaver but now propoſed, is wont to infeſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Lying in, indeed at various times, and by reaſon of divers occaſions, now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the Birth, eſpecially if it be difficult and laborious, now it ariſes in the firſt, now the ſecond, third, or fourth week; yet the ſooner it begins, the more ſafely it is wont to be cured. The Type or Figure of this Diſeaſe, is performed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt after this manner. After a previous indiſpoſition, an open feaveriſhneſs, for the moſt part with a ſhivering, or horror, conſtitutes the firſt aſſault, which is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with heat, and afterwards ſucceeds a ſweat: perhaps, for a day or two, they have various reciprocal fits of heat and cold; then the Blood being wholly inkindled, the Lochia, if not before ſuppreſſed, either flow ſmally, or are wholly ſtopt: If the Diſeaſe be acute, and of a ſwift motion, it comes to its height on the third or fourth day, then an intenſe heat, with a very troubleſome thirſt, a vehement pulſe, and quick pertinacious wakings, a great inquietude of the whole Body, that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually toſſing themſelves in their Beds hither and thither, a thick Urine, and high coloured, and other moſt grievous ſymptoms, are wont to trouble them: whilſt the Feaver is after this manner at its height no Criſis is to be expected; for I never ſaw this Diſeaſe cured by a critical ſweat, but that the buſineſs was ſtill very precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly acted, as after the Blood was grown hot for a little time, preſently the aduſt matter being tranſlated to the Brain, moſt dangerous and heavy inordinations of it, and the whole nervous ſtock forthwith come upon them; for moſt often are ſtirred up, convulſive motions of the Tendons, wonderful diſtentions, and inflations about the Viſcera, like to the hyſterical paſſions; then ſometimes, alſo follow a phrenſie, or dilerium, not ſeldom a ſtupefaction, and ſpeechleſsneſs; the ſtrength is ſuddenly caſt down almoſt in all, without any manifeſt cauſe, the Pulſe becomes weak, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal; and the ſick are ſuddenly precipitated to death: If that any perhaps eſcape, either by the return of the Flux of the Lochia, or a Lask, coming upon it, they hardly recover but of a long time: I have known in ſome, purple ſpots to have appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and certainly in many, ſymptoms that reſpect either the Blood or nervous juice, which argue no light Malignity.</p>
                        <p>We will diſtinguiſh the cauſes of this Feaver, after the ordinary manner, into Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catartic, Evident and Conjunct. Thoſe of the firſt ſort, upon which the malignity, and the greateſt perniciouſneſs of the Diſeaſe depend, are two, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, a depraved diſpoſition of the Blood, from the long ſuppreſſion of the monthly Flux. Secondly, after the Birth, the evil affections of the Womb, from the dangerous Labours of Women, (who undergo the Divine Malediction appointed them) from the Menſtrua being long ſuppreſſed, the Blood not only ſwells up, and its Sulphureous parts being too much carried forth, are rendred more apt for burning, but beſides, the maſs of the Blood is imbued with very fermentative Particles, ſo that (as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hinted) as if it were touched with a venemous infection, preſently growing fervent, it is diſpoſed towards putrefaction, and corruptive diſorders; and beſides, forthwith impoyſons the nervous Liquor, and renders it infeſtuous to the Brain and the whole nervous ſtock. Theſe kind of evils, being impreſſed on the Blood, ought to be purged forth, by the Flux of the Lochia; but if after the Birth, the Womb be
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:152521:82"/>
out of order, the Lochia are not only ſtopped, and ſo a purifying of all the Blood is hindred, but beſides, ſtinking corruptions or defilements, are thence beſtowed on the Blood, and grievouſly infect it: Alſo, by reaſon of convulſive motions, begun about the Womb, and from thence continued to other parts, inordinations are ſtirred up in the Blood and juices, which oftentimes conſpire, either the production, or the acer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation or growing worſe, of the Feaver.</p>
                        <p>The evident cauſes, which induce an actual efferveſcency, either to the Blood, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gotten an ill diſpoſition, or invert the vices of the whole Body to the Womb, are after a diverſe ſort. A painful Labour, a ſolution of the unity about the Womb, a bruiſe, a retention of preternatural things, an ulcerous diſpoſition, and very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other accidents, which are induced by a certain neceſſity, may do this. But the occaſions, that are at the diſpoſe of the Patients, and eaſily to be avoided, which are wont to excite this kind of Feaver, are chiefly two, <hi>viz.</hi> an ill manner of Dyet, and the taking of cold. It is an uſual thing, to give to weak Women, after being Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, on the firſt or ſecond day, the fleſh of living Creatures, or Broths made of fleſh meats, and other foods, very improportionate to their diſpoſitions, from whence preſently ariſe an indigeſtion, and great trouble in the Bowels, and a feaveriſh diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the Blood, by reaſon of a more rich nutritious juice than ought to be. Beſides, the errors in Dyet, oftentimes hurt is cauſed, for that their Bodies, being ſo very tender, alſo by reaſon of the labours of the Birth, and bringing forth the Child, the paſſages are on every ſide opened, they are expoſed too heedleſsly to the cold: for moſt of them, being impatient of their Bed, within a day or two, or ſooner than they ſhould do, riſe out of it, and put on their Cloaths, from whence, preſently the Pores of the skin being ſuddenly contracted, and the Air being admitted into the parts of the Womb, tranſpiration is hindred, and often the Lochia, on the ſudden are ſtopped, either of which ſuffices to excite the feaveriſh diſtemper.</p>
                        <p>The conjunct cauſe, or formal reaſon of this kind of ſickneſs, chiefly comprehends theſe three things, to wit, there are preſent, firſt, a very notable diſcraſie of the Blood, that growing hot, from the Feaver being occaſionally induced, it doth not equally burn forth, nor leiſurely overcome the aduſt recrements, and afterwards cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically thruſt them forth; but the Blood growing hot, is preſently looſned in its mixture, and its frame being unlocked, turns and declines towards corruption; hence, when it grows but a little cool, the ſpirits being ſhaken out of their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are moved into confuſion. In the mean time, the Sulphureous Particles become untamed, and fierce, wherefore, the ſtrength falls down without any manifeſt cauſe, the Pulſe is made weak and diſordered; after the deflagration of the Blood, altho the aduſt recrements are very much heaped up, yet nothing is rightly concocted or ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, but the ſick being greatly oppreſſed in Nature, tho they continually ſweat, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nevertheleſs oftentimes no eaſe from thence; but the feaveriſh matter, which ought to be thruſt forth, being tranſmitted into the head, and nervous ſtock, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there moſt grievous perturbations of the animal regiment. Secondly, the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of this Diſeaſe owes no ſmall part of it, to the nervous juice being preſently made ſharp, and ſo improportionate to the Brain, and its Appendix; for this being infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, from the taint contracted from the Blood, doth not gently water, or pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blow up its ſubjects, but notably hale or pull thoſe tender parts, (as when an infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of vitriol is poured upon a Worm) and irritates or provokes them into convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and into motions, as if of dancing or ſuddenly leaping forth, and ſometimes wholly overturns their functions; hence comes contractures, grievous convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, dilerium, wakings, and ſometimes ſtupification, and the ſleepy Diſeaſe, upon Women Lying in. Thirdly, whilſt theſe things are done, oftentimes a third band of ſymptoms infeſt the ſick, to wit, for that the Womb, being hurt by ſome evil, moves it ſelf diſorderly, and is ſtruck with a Convulſion, according to theſe or thoſe parts, from thence by and by, convulſive motions invade, by the membranes, and nervous paſſages, the whole Region of the Abdomen; wherefore, the Viſcera and Hypocondria are blown up, belchings, and grievous vomitings are ſtirred up, then the Diſtemper creeping upwards, and poſſeſſing the nervous parts of the Thorax, a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult breathing, and unequal, a palpitation of the heart, a ſenſe of choaking in the throat, by reaſon of the Muſcles being there drawn backward, and other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, through the whole Body are excited, the ſame evil being at laſt carried to the Brain.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="154" facs="tcp:152521:83"/>The Feavers of Women in Child-bed almoſt never want danger; but ſometimes it happens, about the beginning, that they are cured by a ſlender Dyet, and by the Flux of the Lochia being reſtored; but if the feaveriſh diſtemper does root it ſelf more deeply, that the whole Blood is inkindled, and immoderately grows hot, the Prognoſtick ought not to be eſteemed of a light Omen; and there will be a greater reaſon of danger, if beſides the heat being ſuffuſed all over, the ſick are troubled with a frequent ſhivering, if they are affected or moleſted with a great diſquietneſs, and wakings, with ſudden concuſſions of the Body, or a contracture of the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons: or if, thirdly, they complain on the fourth day, of a tingling of their ears, with a great repletion or fulneſs of the head, you may from thence collect the evil to grow worſe, <hi>viz.</hi> a tranſlation of the feaveriſh and hurtful matter to the Brain; nor is it leſs to be feared, if they have on them an oppreſſion, and weight of the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> that the ſick cannot breath freely, nor draw their breath deep, and from the bottom of their breaſt, but only from the top, and that frequently, and ſighingly, and that they move themſelves reſtleſly hither and thither: For this argues the Blood to ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in its circulation, about the Heart and Lungs, and alſo to be apt to grow into clodders, and to be coagulated: that if yet worſe diſtempers of the Brain and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſtock follow, and the Pulſe ſhould become weak and unequal, you may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the buſineſs almoſt deplorable; but if (as ſometimes tho it more rarely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens) after the Feaver being inkindled, and grievouſly threatning, either the Flux of the Lochia returns, or a Diarrhea with eaſe ſucceeds, ſome hope of health may be admitted, tho the ſame be at the laſt caſt.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the Cure of theſe kind of Feavers, there lies a very great task upon the Phyſitian, becauſe any Phyſick is eſteemed with the vulgar not only unprofitable, but alſo hurtful for Women in Child-bed; wherefore, Phyſicians are rarely ſent for, unleſs when there is no place left for remedies, and the opportunity of all profitable means be wholly paſt: If that perchance they ſhould be preſent, about the beginning of the Diſeaſe, it will not be eaſie to procure health to the ſick by vulgar Remedies; but whatever they ſhould attempt, unleſs it ſhould bring help, it would be ſaid by the Women, and others about the perſon, to be deadly, and the only cauſe of her death; that in truth there is wont to happen to us, leſs of profit, or more of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny, about the Cure of no other Diſeaſe, as in this.</p>
                        <p>But the method of curing (even as in Contagious Diſeaſes) ought to be inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted twofold; to wit, Prophylactic or Preventive, and Therapeutic or Curative: The former of theſe, delivers precepts and cautions, whereby Women Lying in, may he preſerved from the aſſault of Feavers: the other ſuggeſts Curative intentions, whereby the ſick (if it may be done) may at length recover health.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Although this Feaver be ſomewhat Malignant, it is not caught by Contagion, and there is no fear of the ſicks receiving outwardly any invenomed taint; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, all Women in Child-bed, have an innate mine of virulency, and from the evil of this, as it were the tinder of moſt high Malignity, they ought to beware; wherefore, they need an exact ordering, to wit, whereby after the Birth, the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the Blood and humors, may be rightly purged forth, without danger of a Feaver; alſo, that the evil affections of the Womb, may be healed, and that the ſtrength being broken and debilitated, by the Labour, may be reſtored after its due manner. For theſe ends, theſe three things are chiefly to be inculcated, for preſcripts by Phyſitians. Firſt, I judg it neceſſary, that a moſt exact manner of Dyet be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to Women in Child-bed; to wit, that they be wholly fed with Oatmeal Candle, made ſometimes of Beer, and ſometimes of Water and White-wine mixt together, alſo with Panada, and other light nouriſhers, for a week at leaſt; becauſe they are much emptied, therefore it may be lawful for them to ſup often, but nothing of ſolid or more ſtrong food is to be given. For I have diligently obſerved that theſe Feavers have been ofteneſt induced, by the eating too ſoon fleſh, or ſtrong Broths or Food. Foraſmuch as Women Lying in, ought to be handled, not only as thoſe that are grievouſly wounded, but as thoſe that have got a feaveriſh indiſpoſition, from a diſturbed diſpoſition and temper of the Blood: For with them, the Blood being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready too much carried forth, and as it were touched with an impure infection, moſt quickly catches Flame, by the acceſs or means of any Sulphureous thing. Secondly, after Dyet, the care will be, leſt the Pores be ſhut up, by the incautiouſly taking cold from without, or that the Lochia ſhould be ſtopped: for upon the leaſt occaſion, the manner of tranſpiration being changed, the Blood firſt growing hot, conceives diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders:
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:152521:83"/>
alſo the Womb being touched by the blaſt of Air, contracts it ſelf, and ſhuts up the mouths of the Veſſels, whereby the Lochia flow forth leſs: wherefore, for five days at leaſt, after being Delivered, I would have Women wholly to keep their Beds. I know that 'tis a common cuſtom, to raiſe them from Bed on the third day, but by that means I have known many that have fallen into Feavers; and in truth, if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to keep Women in Child-bed from all danger, the ſafeſt means will be, that they may be kept long in their Beds. Thirdly, concerning preſervation, the intent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that by cauſing a gentle provocation of the Blood, in Women Lying in, the Flux of the Lochia may be continued: for this end, Midwives are wont (if after a difficult Labour they fear that evil) to give them <hi>Sperma Ceti,</hi> or powder of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Slate, or Saffron ſteeped in White-wine: Moreover, to make them Oat-meal Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, that may more fuſe the Blood, of Water, and White and Rheniſh Wine mixed together, in which they boyl, or in poſſet drink alſo, Marigold Flowers, leaves of Penyroyal, or Mugwort, there are many other kinds of adminiſtrations extant, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ordering Women in Child-bed, which being commonly known, I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly paſs over here.</p>
                        <p>The Cure of the ſubſequent Feaver of Women in Child-bed, is far from the uſual method in Putrid Feavers: for in this, it is not to be expected, that the Blood being touched with a feaveriſh burning, ſhould by degrees burn forth, and the ſame ſhould be ſeparated by a Criſis, but rather (as it is done in a Malignant Feaver) as ſoon as the Blood grows immoderately hot, it is convenient for it to be moved by gentle Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick Remedies, and its heterogeneous and impure mixtures to be carried forth of doors; wherefore, among the common people it is a cuſtom (and that not bad) to give to feaveriſh Women Lying in, ſudorificks preſently: by this means, the Blood being eventilated, its effervency is allayed; alſo, by reaſon of its agitation, the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia apt to be reſtrained, are provoked into a Flux. There is great difference among Authors, from whence the beginnings of theſe kind of Feavers ought to be compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>viz.</hi> whether from the Birth it ſelf, or from the firſt ſenſe of growing feaveriſh? however it matters little whether it be after this or that manner: For ſince this Feaver runs not the uſual ſtadia or courſes of the Putrid, neither hath a Criſis, nor wholly admits the uſe of Cathartic or Purging Remedies, we need not be ſolicitous ſo much for the days, concerning its period and menſuration. But yet, as to the Curative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications, it will be of uſe only to diſtinguiſh what is to be done in the beginning, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and end of this Diſeaſe: alſo, what we ought to indeavour whilſt there is ſome ſtrength remaining, as alſo what, when 'tis oppreſſed, and very much deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                        <p>When therefore any Woman in Child-bed is firſt taken with this Feaver (whoſe aſſault is known from the milky Feaver, becauſe for the moſt part it begins with a ſhivering) you muſt preſently let it be your work, that the more plentiful ſuſtenance may be drawn away from the burning Blood, and as I have already admoniſhed, that the fleſh of living Creatures, and Broths made of them, be utterly forbidden; yet in the mean time, all cold things, and that are indued with a ſtyptic or binding vertue, are equally to be avoided; for theſe fix the Blood, and bind it too much, and hinder its very requiſite Purgation, both by the Lochia, and by tranſpiration thorow the skin. But rather, though the Feaver be urgent, give them decoctions, powders, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of things moderately hot: of which ſort are, (as is already ſaid) decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Diſtilled Waters of the Flowers of Marigoids, the Leaves of Pennyroyal, Mugwort, the roots of Scorzonera, alſo Bezoartic Powders, Spirits of Harts-horn, fixed ſalts of Herbs, &amp;c. If the Lochia ſhould be ſtopt, that their Flux may be again provoked, muſt be indeavoured every way: To the moving of this, conduce fricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ligatures about the Thighs and Legs; ſometimes Cupping-Glaſſes, or Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters about the Thighs or Hips, alſo in the ſoles of the Feet: alſo, ſometimes the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening a Vein in the Ankle is convenient, in the mean time a fomentation of the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterical decoction, is to be applied about the Pubis, or the Caul of a Weather or Sheep, taken out warm, may be layed to the bottom of the Belly; and experience manifeſts, that ſometimes injections into the Womb are profitable: If the Belly yields not, it may be gently brought down, with a violet ſuppoſitory ſo called, or an emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient Clyſter; of more ſtrong provocations you muſt take heed, becauſe in Women Lying in, even as in a Malignant Feaver, from a copious dejection, with loſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, Life is quickly loſt. If with the ſuppreſſion of the Lochia, there be a notable perturbation of the Blood, with vomiting, thirſt, and wakings, I have often known,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:152521:84"/>
Laudanum mixt with Saffron, given with happy ſucceſs. Inſtead of a cooling Julep, this kind of mixture is convenient, <hi>viz.</hi> take of water of Pennyroyal, and Balm, each three ounces, of hyſterical water two ounces, of the Syrrop of Mugwort three ounces and an half, of the tincture of Saffron two drams, of Caſtor ty'd in a rag, and hung in the glaſs, one ſcruple, mingle theſe, and let them drink of this three or four ſpoonfuls oftentimes in a day.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If notwithſtanding the uſe of theſe Remedies the Feaver grows ſtill worſe, and by degrees is increaſed with worſer ſymptoms, that beſides the diſorders of the Blood, the Brain and nervous parts begin to be touched, Medicines, tho many of every kind may be tryed, do little; yea, in this caſe the indications are almoſt the ſame, with thoſe made uſe of in the Plague it ſelf: foraſmuch as the Lochia being for a good while ſuppreſſed, they cannot eaſily be reduced, or ſcarcely at all, in the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Blood and humors, therefore it is convenient quickly to move a ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to wit, that the corruptions, impreſſed on the Blood and nervous juice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtagnating from the Womb, may be carried forth ſome how, by ſweat, and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tranſpiration. Therefore here, Powders, and Confections of Bezoar, Spirit of Hartshorn, or of Soot, tinctures of Corals or Pearls help. I have ſometimes ſeen, by the help of thoſe kind of Medicines, in a deſperate caſe, when the Pulſe, and other ſymptoms have appeared a little better, ſome ſmall hopes to ſhew themſelves; yet Cure rarely to follow: but when the uſe of theſe Cordials were left off, the ſick with a weak Pulſe, and a Looſneſs preſently ariſing, have been precipitated to Death.</p>

When yet the buſineſs of the ſick proves ſtill worſe, when the Feaver being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, the Pulſe is weak and unequal, and frequent horrors, and convulſive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the whole body, with a delirium, and ſtupefaction infeſt them; then the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian having firſt made a Prognoſtication of Death, may inſiſt upon a few Remedies, and thoſe only Cordials, and muſt wholly abſtain from blood-letting, ſcarification, bliſtering, or the uſe of Cupping-glaſſes: for ſuch adminiſtrations beget only an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um and blame, that by ſo doing, we are eſteemed by ſome Women, as wicked and cruel.</p>

                        <head>The Symptomatic Feavers of Women in Child-bed.</head>
                        <p>THE Acute Diſeaſes of Women in Child-bed, ſhew themſelves not only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Figure of the aforeſaid Feaver, but ſometimes they are beſet with ſome ſignal ſymptoms, to wit, the Squinancy, Pleurifie, inflamation of the Lungs, Dyſentery, Small-Pox, or of ſome other kind; and at that time, they get the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of thoſe Diſtempers. It will not be here ſeaſonable, to repeat at large, what belongs to the eſſences and natures of each: but I ſhall briefly ſhew, what theſe ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, being complicated with the diſtempers of Women Lying in, contain peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly, as to the Cauſes or Cures.</p>
                        <p>All theſe ſymptoms, we ſuppoſe to proceed, from a certain Coagulation of the Blood, and from thence its extravaſation: But whilſt the Blood is extravaſated, or put forth of the Veſſels in one part, its efflux, however natural, and critical, is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in another: wherefore it is dangerous, leſt whilſt the Blood begins to be coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, either in a particular or accuſtomed neſt of Coagulation, or univerſally in its whole maſs, the flowing of the Lochia be ſtopped, which in truth for the moſt part happens, and therefore theſe Diſtempers, for the moſt part, are deadly to Women in Child-bed: yet the cauſe of their Death, for the moſt part, happens with ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Small Pox, the flowing of the Lochia, draws inwardly the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, begun to be carried forth outwardly, and forthwith compels the maſs of Blood, and the heart it ſelf, to be impoyſoned, with its evil; and therefore in the Small Pox, theſe purgings of the Womb, are convenient to be ſtopped: But in the Pleuriſie, Squinancy, and the reſt, when the provocative of the Diſeaſe, being fixed here or there, in a particular place, draws to it ſelf the impurities of the Blood, which ought to be ſeparated or ſifted forth by the Lochia, and derives it ſtreight from the Womb, for that reaſon it increaſes the impurity of the Blood. The Lochia being ſtopped in the Small Pox, by the more univerſal manner or way of excretion, may be ſhut forth of doors, with the venemous Particles of the Diſeaſe, which thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed does not ſucceed in the reſt, by reaſon of the minute, and more ſparing manner of excretion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="157" facs="tcp:152521:84"/>Of theſe, the Squinancy, Pleuriſie, and Inflamation of the Lungs, by reaſon, both of the great ſimilitude of the Cauſe, and analogy of the Cure, may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together: when any Woman Lying in is diſtempered with any of theſe, it is to be ſuppoſed, that beſides the Infection, gathered together in the time of being Big-bellied, there happens a certain ſouriſh diſpoſition of the Blood, by the means of which, whilſt that it ſelf grows feaveriſhly hot, certain Particles of it, being fuſed with the ſourneſs enter into congelation, in this or that part, like Milk growing ſour, and then to be coagulated: The Blood being there frozen or congealed, and hindred in its circuit, ſtops the paſſage of the reſt; but the Blood being obſtructed in its motion, buts againſt the impediment, and ſo being heaped up about it, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth of the Veſſels, grows into a tumour: from thence preſently, whatſoever is contained in its maſs, that is heterogeneous, and to be ſifted forth, is layed aſide into the diſtempered part, as it were a ſink: wherefore, the corruptions of the Blood, that ought to be purged forth by the Womb, are derived from thence towards the neſt of this Diſeaſe, which, when they cannot be ſufficiently purged forth by this way, both more remarkably corrupt the Liquor of the Blood, and render the particular diſtemper, <hi>viz.</hi> the Squinancy, Pleuriſie, or any other more hard to be cured.</p>
                        <p>For the Cure of theſe kind of complicated diſtempers, preſently from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, it ſhould be endeavoured, that the Blood being fixed ſomewhere, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to be extravaſated, may be reſtored to Circulation, that it may not impoſtumate; becauſe, very rarely, Women Lying in, are cured of theſe Symptomatic Feavers, by an Impoſthume, or ſpitting forth of the corrupt matter: Wherefore, internal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, which fuſe the Blood, and free it from Coagulation, are to be made uſe of; of which ſort are chiefly Diaphoretics full of a volatile Salt, as Spirit of Hartshorn, Soot, Urine, alſo the Salts themſelves; in like manner Shelly and Bezoartic Powders, Lapis Prunellae Decoctions and Juleps of Vegetables provoking Urine, or the terms, with all which ought to be mixed, what by experience are found proper for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of the Womb: Beſides, diſcuſſing Remedies, which may drive away the impacted matter, and diſperſe it (of which ſort are Liniments, Fomentations, and Cataplaſms) are diligently to be applied. In the mean time, the more impetuous motion, and immoderate effervency of the Blood, are to be removed, and its purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by all the ways poſſible transferred to the inferior parts. For this end Frictions, Ligatures, Epiſpaſtics, and (if need be) Scarifying about the Feet and Legs, are to be adminiſtred; if the diſtemper very much growing worſe, a taking away of Blood be indicated, unleſs there be a great fulneſs in the whole Body, and a very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute inflamation in the diſtempered part; it will be beſt to open a Vein in the Foot, or to take away Blood from the hemorrhoid Veins by Leeches: But if neceſſity urges, it may be done in the Arm it ſelf; if after that Letting Blood (if another be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) let it be done in the Leg; but you are to be warned, that in theſe caſes, the opening a Vein is to be ordered very cautiouſly, for unleſs it brings preſent help, (which I have rarely known it to do) immediately the Pulſe being made more weak, the buſineſs of the ſick becomes much worſe.</p>
                        <p>The Dyſentery takes its riſe almoſt for the like cauſe, with the aforeſaid diſtempers; but in this, becauſe the extravaſated Blood is preſently poured forth, nor being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Body, becomes there troubleſome, or is any more corrupted, and as this Flux makes an excretion near the Womb, and does not afterwards dreive it to any other place, there is leſs of danger to be feared, from this Diſeaſe, than from thoſe aforeſaid: yet oftentimes this Diſeaſe is fatal to Women in Child-bed, for that indeed, the rather, becauſe things attempering the Blood, and moderately binding, are ordered for the Dyſentery: for theſe are found too apt to inhibit the Flux of the Lochia; wherefore in this caſe, until the Women Lying in are ſufficiently purged by a long Flux, the Cure of the other Diſeaſe is to be omitted, and the fierceneſs of the ſymptoms is to be allayed, only with gentle aſſwaging things.</p>
                        <p>The indications of the Small Pox, do not only differ from thoſe above deſcribed, but indeed they are beſet with contraries to themſelves; for they require (as hath been ſaid) that the Flux of the Lochia ſhould be moderately ſtaid: yet in the mean time, that the flowring forth of the Blood, and a gentle ſweat ought to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for when in this Diſeaſe, the invenomed ferment is twofold, and the corrupt Particles of the Blood, are carried outwardly in a twofold way, you muſt beware, leſt that the leſſer, and ſtraiter part, ſhould draw to its door, the whole matter, or more than it were able to ſend forth: therefore, leſt the Lochia flowing more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:152521:85"/>
ſhould recall inwardly the venom, apt to flower outwardly, the manner or way of Dyet is ſomewhat to be changed, and ſpecially thoſe things which have a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon reſiſting force, and are alſo aſtringent (as the roots of Tormentil and Biſtort) are to be boyled in the Broths of the ſick; alſo Powders, Juleps, and Opiats, indued with ſuch like virtue, are convenient to be adminiſtred at due intervals: yea, in this caſe, by no means, Women ſhould be indulged, that they might eat fleſh, or Broth made of it, or to riſe out of their Bed: but the quiet, both of mind and Body, is to be procured, as much as may be, and a Dyet to be ordered of thoſe things, that move not the Blood, and the buſineſs almoſt wholly to be committed to God and Nature.</p>
                        <p>What hath already been ſaid, concerning the acute Diſeaſes of Women in Child-bed, may eaſily be illuſtrated with Hiſtories and Obſervations: But examples which may be brought in this thing, for the greateſt part, are mournful and of an ill chance: becauſe thoſe Feavers for the moſt part end in Death. But to deſcribe theſe kind of ſickneſſes, does neither confirm the work of the Phyſitian, nor render ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the method of Medicine, altogether taken in them; however, becauſe the knowledg of theſe may make for the better diſcovery of this Diſeaſe, I ſhall here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome ſingular caſes of Women Lying in, and variety of ſymptoms; in which, altho the forms and means of Cure more ſparingly occur, yet we may have ſome rules of precaution, of no contemplable uſe.</p>
                        <p>A Gentlewoman in her ſix and twentieth year of her Age, brought forth her ſixth Child, with very difficult Labour, and not without danger of her Life; yet preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, ſhe began to be better; on the ſecond day ſhe eat a whole Chicken, on the third roſe out of her Bed, and ſate in a Chair for four hours; the night following ſhe found her ſelf ill, at which time her Milk came into her Breaſts; which, by the application of Diaculum Plaiſters, ſoon vaniſhed; the next morning ſhe complained of a wearineſs, and as it were an ulcerous pain of her whole Body, alſo of a vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nauſeouſneſs, and fulneſs about the Ventricle, and Hypochondria: the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing night was full of trouble; on the fifth day ſhe was plainly in a Feaver, ſhe felt now a ſhivering, now a heat, every where increaſing, ſhe nauſeated every thing, and was troubled at her Stomach, moreover being unquiet, and without ſleep, the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia flowed little, but a whitiſh humor (commonly called the Flux of the Milk) came away: In the evening ſhe had a weight, and as it were a ſleepineſs about her forehead and temples, and began to ſleep a little; but awaking in half an hour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſturbed with Phantaſms, ſhe complained of her head, as if increaſed in bulk, alſo of her jaws being ſet, that ſhe could not open her teeth, and her fiſts being ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clutched, ſhe ſeemed as if ſhe felt a pricking and ſtupor, or numneſs in her whole Body; her Ventricle and Hypochondria ſtood ſtill inflated, and ſtretched forth; they adminiſtred to her Frictions, Ligatures, Cupping-glaſſes, and other Remedies, both inward and outward, that might recall the Lochia, and drive the recrements of the Blood from the head: Her Pulſe being weak, and diſordered, would not admit of Letting Blood; Powders, and Juleps, which might gently move ſweating, and fuſe the Blood and nervous juice, and hinder them from reſtagnating, were diligently gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her; yea, fomentations, now of Wollen Cloaths dipped in emollient Decoctions, and now of warm inwards of living Creatures, were applied to her Belly; in the mean time, ſtinking things (ſuch as they uſe to the Mother Fits) were put to her noſe, which might drive away the impetuouſneſs of the Spirits and Blood, carried into the head, but theſe, and other things, being for ſeveral hours carefully perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſhe ſeem'd to feel ſome eaſe; but ſtill ſhe feared to ſhut her eyes, or to ſettle herſelf to ſleep, for her eye lids being cloſed, a thouſand Phantaſms ran in her mind, with noiſe and tingling in her whole head: ſhe continued that night almoſt without ſleep; aſſoon as ſhe had begun to ſleep, preſently being affrighted, and feeling a weight in her Precordia, ſhe was awaked: on the ſixth day about noon, ſhe was troubled with a great ſhivering, or rather an horror, with a ſtrong concuſſion of the whole Body; to which, as in the fit of an Ague, by and by heat, and then ſweat co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly followed: but from thence, nothing of eaſe accrued to the ſick, for preſently after the ſweat, the feaveriſh heat was renewed, and convulſive diſtempers infeſted her more: the night following, with the reſt of the ſymptoms growing worſe, firſt a Palſie was excited in her tongue, and by and by in her throat, that ſhe could not ſpeak, and ſcarce ſwallow at all: on the ſeventh day, about the ſame hour, a ſhive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring invaded her again, with heat and ſweat; then her Pulſe being much weaker,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:152521:85"/>
and unequal; alſo a difficult breathing, and fetching the breath ſhort and quick, with her Breaſt lifted up, ſhe knew not them about her: on the eighth day ſhe died.</p>
                        <p>There was a manifold occaſion of the death of this Gentlewoman, prediſpoſed to a Feaver, by reaſon of her Big-belly, and which had increaſed the malignity of the Diſeaſe over and above; for the hurt received by her hard Labour, the ſudden exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Milk from her Breaſts, the eating of fleſh, and the riſing too ſoon our of her bed, hapning together, made as it were a conſpiration for the greater evil: The Blood being touched with a feaveriſh burning, preſently conceived inordinations, and ſnatched into it ſelf the Lochia, and perhaps other defilements of the Womb, and ſo by that means acquired a greater infection, and plainly venemous diſpoſition; the membranes of the Viſcera, being imbrued with the degenerate nervous juice, were ſtruck either with Convulſive motions, or with Convulſions continued to them from the Womb; for theſe kind of inflations, about the Abdomen, and thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentions are the effects of Convulſions: For altho the direct Fibres drawing the member do oftentimes preſs it, yet ſince the Fibres are direct and tranſverſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers placed in a various ſite, the membranes are pulled together into an hollowneſs, by their coming together, the part ſwells up like a blown bladder, into whoſe vacuity the Air being rarefied ſecondarily carries it ſelf forward: But it is not the Air (as is commonly ſaid) or a blaſt there at firſt heaped up, that is the cauſe of the diſtention. The Blood growing hot in our ſick perſon, and being quickly filled with an aduſt and malignant matter, did endeavour to ſubdue it, and being unable to put it forth by ſweat, forthwith fixed it in the Brain; the firſt ſuffuſion of the ſame matter into the head, by reaſon of the animal Spirits being half overthrown, brought in that ſenſe of her head being much increaſed in bulk; which thing happened by the like means, as when the foot being taken with a ſleepineſs, ſeems as if it felt much bigger than it is: But that after ſome caſe, the diſtemper grew worſe, by ſleep and cloſing of her eyes, the reaſon is, becauſe waking, and the exerciſe of the ſenſes, ſhake off and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from them, ſomewhat, the matter beſieging the Brain and Nerves; which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding being neer and in its precincts, ſleep creeping on, is as it were ſupped up by them, and enters their Bodies more deeply with the alible juice. But the Blood, altho it had plentifully poured forth its recrements in the Brain, yet did not itſelf become free; but being ſtill full, with an impure ballaſt, it conceived as it were a critical flowring, and attempted to ſhake off its burthen once or twice (as it is wont in a great excretion) with a ſhivering, and with heat and ſweat following it, by which endeavour however nothing was further effected, than that the matter ſticking to the Brain, pierced more deeply into it, and becoming fixed in ſome little ſhoots of the Nerves, took away her ſpeech and ſwallowing, and afterwards her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and the maſs of Blood, being by degrees more and more depraved, at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came unable to ſuſtain Life.</p>
                        <p>A noble Gentlewoman, being married a little before ſhe was twenty years of Age, and being with Child, uſed, during the time, an ill dyet, and little or no exerciſe; yet falling into Labour, and ſuffering the torments with intermiſſion, and frequent caſe for twelve hours, at length was brought to Bed of a Son: The Child, with the after-birth came away, and all things were right about the Womb: the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day ſhe found her ſelf indifferently well, but on the third, after a light ſhiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe began to complain of thirſt and heat; to which a looſneſs followed, that ſhe had that day four ſtools: the following night ſhe was almoſt without ſleep, the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh diſtemper remained, after that, in the ſame manner for two days; daily ſhe purged three or four time the Lochia as yet flowed moderately: when on the ſixth day, by the perſuaſion of the Women, ſhe had took ſome aſtringent thing, to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Flux of her Belly, the purgings of the Womb were almoſt wholly ſtayed: at which time the Feaver became more ſtrong, and ſymptoms as it were hyſterical ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; for in her Precordia, ſhe had great and frequent oppreſſions, and was troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a ſenſe of choaking in her throat; on the ſeventh day, the heat was yet ſtronger, and her breathing difficult and laborious; but then, by the preſcription of a Phyſician, at that time firſt ſent for, Blood was taken from her foot to three ounces, by which ſhe was better for four hours; for a quiet ſteep, with a plentiful ſweat fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed upon it, and the Lochia appeared again tho in ſmall quantity: In the Evening again, all things grew worſe, her ſtrength being very much loſt, her Pulſe weaker and unequal; ſhe complained alſo of a noiſe and tingling of her ears, with a fulneſs of her head, moreover a leaping up of the tendons in her wriſts; alſo ſhe had ſudden
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:152521:86"/>
concuſſions of her wholy Body, yet ſtill her looſneſs held; to her were adminiſtred, by the preſcripts of ſeveral Phyſicians, Cordials, and other Remedies, and kinds of Adminiſtrations carefully, but nothing profited: her Pulſe being more weak, and her ſtrength leiſurely waſting, ſhe died on the ninth day, after ſhe was delivered.</p>
                        <p>This Feaver very much depended upon the vitious proviſion of the Body, as the procatartic cauſe; for I have often obſerved, that it fares ill with Women Lying in, who when Big bellied devoured fruit, and any unwholſom traſh, and living without motion or exerciſe, indulged themſelves with eaſe and reſt: the Blood, by reaſon of the previous Cachexie, conceived a burning without any evident cauſe, as it were of its own accord: But growing hot, laying inwardly ſtill its recrements, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, cauſed the Diarrhea: neither yet was its maſs made more pure, by its almoſt continual excretion, yea, rather being ſtill more depraved in its mixtion or craſis, the Blood at length wholly departed from its proper diſpoſition, and became unable to be fermented in the heart, whereby heat and breath might be every where diſperſed: The looſneſs, excited by the motion of Nature, was untowardly ſtopped, eſpecially by the uſe of aſtringent things; for this I have often obſerved, never to be done without paying for it; becauſe the Flux of the Belly has cured ſome that have been ill, but in this Lady, and in many others (as has abundantly appeared to our experience) altho it did not take away the Feaver, yet it freed her from the more grievous diſtempers of the Brain and nervous ſtock: from whence this ſick perſon was wholly free from a Delirium, nor was ſtruck with Convulſive motions, till reduced almoſt to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
                        <p>The Mother of a Family, and a Gentlewoman, about 36 years of Age or upwards, being with Child of her ſeventeenth Child, was troubled, and very anxious, leſt ſhe ſhould die of that Child-bearing: But (God favouring) ſhe was delivered well enough of a Son, and for three days after ſhe was very cheerful: on the fourth day, when ſhe had eaten more than ſhe ſhould do of a Chicken, a little before night ſhe fell into a feaveriſh Diſtemper, with vomiting, and a ſtopping of the Lochia: all night ſhe lay reſtleſs and without ſleep, the next morning ſhe had four ſtools, and ſeemed ſomewhat eaſed: about Noon (about which time I came to her) ſhe complained again of heat and thirſt, as alſo a palpitation of the heart, and of the aſcent of ſome ſubſtance in her throat: her Pulſe was quick and ſmall, her Urine red, the Lochia ſcarce appeared: I ordered her Juleps, Cordials, and things to purge the Womb, beſides a fomentation for the bottom of her Belly, alſo her Legs and Feet to be rubbed often, with warm Wollen Cloaths; at going to ſleep I gave her of Laudanum one grain, with Saffron Pouder half a ſcruple, in a ſpoonful of Treacle-water: She ſlept well, and the Lochia came down plentifully, and by that means, with a ſlender dyet, and continuing to provoke moderately the Flux of the Womb, for a few days, ſhe became very well.</p>
                        <p>The immoderate eating of fleſh, as an evident and almoſt only ſufficient cauſe, without any great proviſion, or vitious prediſpoſition, induced the Feaver. The Lochia reſtagnating into the Blood, increaſed its intemperance, and preſently brought troubles upon the nervous kind; but in the mean time, the Blood altho growing hot, did not undergo any great corruption, but when the recrements, heaped up by the Surfeit, were ſent forth by the looſneſs, and the Blood, the Lochia being reſtored, began to be purged forth again after its wonted manner, this Feaver wanting a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther malignant ferment, quickly vaniſhed.</p>
                        <p>A noble Lady, young, and fair, was brought to Bed of a ſecond Child, and for ſix days, as to the Lochia and other accidents, ſhe was well, and wholly free from the ſuſpicion of any intemperature: ſhe ate fleſh daily, and riſing from her Bed, was brisk and chearful in her Chamber; on the ſeventh day, without any manifeſt cauſe, a ſhivering came upon her, with a Feaver, and a leſſning of the Lochia, but not ſuppreſſed: to the tenth day after her Delivery, ſhe was only moderately feaveriſh; whilſt the purgings of the Womb yet flowed, ſhe remained free from any grievous ſymptom: but then, although ſhe was greatly feaveriſh, ſhe was more cheerful than ordinary, and ſeemed more confident of her health: at Night ſhe ſlept little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; the morning following (at which time I firſt viſited her) ſhe clearly raved, the Lochia were ſtopped, alſo her whole Body was ſhaken with horror the tendons in her wriſts were pulled together, ſo that I could hardly diſtinguiſh her Pulſe, which in the mean time was weak, unequal, and very quick. I ſaid ſhe would die quickly, unleſs God ſhould miraculouſly reſtore her by his Divine Power, however, ſix grains

                        <p>A Woman well known, who had ſcarce paſſed the twentieth Year of her Age, of a florid countenance, and ſlender Body, after her being brought to Bed, when the Lochia flowed immoderately, made uſe of ſome aſtringent Remedies, by the counſel of thoſe about her, by which means they were wholly ſtopped; but a Flux of her Belly ſucceeded, which when it had increaſed for three days, the Women gave her other things for the ſtopping her Looſneſs: nor were they fruſtrated in the ſucceſs; in the mean time, in the place of the former evil, they had brought a moſt dangerous Feaver, and diſtempers as it were hyſterical: for the unhappy Gentlewoman Lying in, was troubled with thirſt, heat, wakings, and at ſeveral turns, with ſwoonings, and cold ſweats; at this time being ſent for, I preſcribed her Cardaic Remedies, and ſuch as moved the purgings of the Womb, and alſo a Clyſter to be given her: at length, the Flux of her Belly being provoked, the Lochia alſo came down, and the ſick Woman being freed from the aforeſaid ſymptoms, and the more grievous Diſeaſe, to wit, the Remedies of the Nurſes, quickly grew well of her Feaver.</p>
                        <p>The more plentiful Flux of the Womb, hapning to this Woman, removed the Procatartic cauſe of a more grievous Diſeaſe: wherefore, when they had committed ſo many errors about the ordering her, (<hi>viz.</hi> firſt in ſtopping the Lochia, then what might compenſate their defect, in hindring the Flux of her Belly) yet the Feaver was only light, and without any venomous taint impreſſed on the Blood; the like to this I have known to happen frequently, to wit, when at firſt the purgings of the Womb have flown very plentifully, afterwards when they have flown very ſparingly, and ſometimes ſtopped, the Women in Child-bed have eſcaped. And by the way, it is here to be noted, that it is wholly dangerous, to inhibit, or at leaſt divert, and croſs any motion of Nature, incited, tho irregular.</p>
                        <p>A Noble Gentlewoman, about 20 years of Age, indued with a ſmooth and full habit of Body, miſcarried twice in the ſpace of a Year; when ſhe had again Concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by the preſcription of her Phyſician, ſhe provoked a Vomit once a month, by drinking plentifully Poſſet Drink, by which ſhe was wont to caſt forth much thick tough Phlegm, alſo in the time of her being with Child, he Let her Blood 5 times; the time of her going being over, ſhe was brought to Bed of a Son, with very hard Labour; the Secundine came whole away, and ſhe purged notably: on the ſecond day, whilſt ſhe was lifted upon her feet in Bed, that the Sheets and the Blankets might be laid in better order, ſhe took Cold, and by that means the bloody Lochia wholly ſtopped, and only a little ſerous Water came away: on the third day ſhe began to complain of an acute pain in her right ſide, to which the Women laid Bags of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momil made hot with Bricks, but the diſtemper grew worſe with a bloody ſpittle; on the fourth day of her being brought to Bed, a moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>harp pain, with a difficult breathing, and very Laborious, invaded her: by the preſcription of her Phyſician, then coming to her from the neigbourhood, ſix ounces of Blood was taken away, out of the Baſilic Vein, and ſhe felt ſudden eaſe, for 10 hours ſhe was better, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the night the pricking pain returned with its wonted fierceneſs: at length, other Phyſicians being called to Counſel, they agreed that it was neceſſary to open a Vein again, in the arm of the diſtempered ſide: four ounces of Blood being taken away, the pain remitted, and the ſick breathed better; then by Diaſphoretic Remedies, ſhe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:152521:87"/>
fell into a great ſweat, with a quiet ſleep: But the Pulſe was made quicker and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, alſo contractures of the tendons in her wriſts appeared: preſently afterwards ſhe talked idly, and within 24 hours, after ſhe was laſt Let Blood, ſhe departed.</p>
                        <p>That this Lady fell into a Pleuriſie, with a Feaver, upon the Lochia being ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the cauſe in ſome meaſure ſeemed to be, the Letting of Blood ſo often in the time of her being with Child: for by this means, the Blood being accuſtomed to be even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated at the arm, afterwards growing hot, leaving the Womb, was carried violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the place of its letting forth, where, when it found not a paſſage, it fixed in the neighbouring ſide, as the next neſt to the place of extravaſation; yea, beſides the uſual manner of a Pleuriſie, there was no ſmall malignity hapned to this Diſeaſe; for the Blood being hindred from being let forth of the Veſſels, began preſently to be corrupted in its diſpoſition, and in the third day of the Feaver, was ſo much depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that it could not be any longer fermented in the heart ſo as to Prorogue Life.</p>
                        <p>It was not ſo with the Wife of a certain Smith, who was brought to Bed, at what time her Children had the Small Pox in the ſame Houſe, and ſhe her ſelf, as it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had taken the Contagion of the ſame Diſeaſe, for on the ſecond day after her Delivery, they began to break forth with a feaveriſh heat, and pain in her Loyns, which indeed for three days, whilſt the Lochia moderately flowed, aroſe rightly into little ſwellings; altho the purging of the Womb was very copious at that time, ſhe had the Small Pox very thick all over her Body, not only in the ſuperficies of her skin, but alſo they filled the cavity of her mouth and throat, ſo that ſhe could ſcarce ſpeak or ſwallow: The ſixth day of her Lying in, the Lochia flowed immoderately, from whence preſently fell upon the ſick, a frequent ſwooning, with a flagging of the Small Pox, Convulſions, and other ſymptoms of an ill nature, which threatned Death ſoon; being ſent for, I preſcribed half a dram of this Powder, to be taken conſtantly every three hours, in a ſpoonful of the following Julep, <hi>viz.</hi> take of the Roots of Tormentil in Powder, drams two, of the beſt Bole Armonie dram one, of the ſpecies of Hyacinth half a dram, make a Powder. Take of the Compound Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Scordium, of Dragons, of Meadowſweet, each three ounces, of Therecal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar one ounce, of the Syrup of Corals two ounces, of Harts-horn burnt half a dram, make a Julep. Beſides, I ordered to be boyled in her Broths, and in every thing ſhe drank, the Roots of Tormentil: by theſe Remedies, the purging of her Womb was ſoon wholly ſtopped, and the Small Pox by degrees being ripened, came off without any grievous ſymptom.</p>
                        <p>Indeed this caſe was difficult, and was cured with great danger, <hi>viz.</hi> for either the Lochia, or the Small Pox to have been reſtrained inwardly, was very dangerous, and yet the more full eruption of the one, hindred the motion of the other; ſo long as either moderately proceeded, things being permitted to the conduct of Nature was moderately well: but when one of them became ill, the work of Art was required, and it was requiſite to bridle the Lochia, but to provoke the Small Pox.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Of Epidemical Feavers.</head>
                     <p>HAving meditated rather a Commentary, than an intire Tract, I had thought here to have concluded our Diſcourſe of Feavers: But foraſmuch as certain Epidemical Feavers do often ſpread, which obſerve no Laws, nor can be brought to any certain rule of Doctrine, but being irregular vary every year, and for that reaſon, as often as any of them increaſe or ſpread abroad, preſently it is called the new Diſeaſe; therefore, I thought it worth our while, becauſe general precepts concerning theſe Feavers are not to be delivered, to ſubjoyn ſome particular Hiſtories, of ſome of this kind; for out of the various proviſion of ſymptoms, whereby they are wont to be noted, the nature and the whole formal reaſon of theſe kind of diſtempers, may ſomewhat appear. Since therefore of late years, within a ſhort tract of time, three popular Diſeaſes have ſpread in theſe Countrys, I will add, as a Crown to this work, the ſeveral Deſcriptions of them, made at thoſe times, when theſe Feavers raged.</p>
                     <div type="part">
                        <head>A Deſcription of an Epidemical Feaver, ſpreading about Autumn, in the Year <hi>1657.</hi> taken in the middle of <hi>September.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>WHilſt we meditate the Deſcription of a Feaver, at this time cruelly raging, it is fit, that following the example of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> we firſt conſider the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going conſtitution of the Year, its intemperance and exceſs of qualities. For Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical Diſeaſes, and commonly excited among the people, are from a common cauſe; ſuch as the habit of the Year, and by that means contracted, a diſpoſition of the Blood, by which many are alike affected. But that we may draw the matter from the beginning, the laſt Spring, and the time ſucceeding it, even to the end of the Summer, was all that half years ſpace extremely dry and hot, but eſpecially after the Summer ſolſtice, the heats were ſo intenſe for many weeks following, that day and night there was none that did not complain of the heat of the Air, and were almoſt in a continual ſweat, and were not able to breath freely: About the Calends of <hi>July,</hi> this Feaver, at firſt ſporadical or particular, began to break forth in ſome places, that perhaps one or two were taken in the ſame City or Village: In many it imitated the likeneſs of an intermitting Tertian, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fits returned every other day; which yet infeſted the ſick with a moſt intenſe heat, without any cold or ſhivering going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; Vomiting and Choleric Stools plentifully hapned to moſt, ſweat ſucceeding but difficultly, and often interrupted, whereby the feaveriſh fit rarely ended in a remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that all the time between, the ſick continued languiſhing and weak, with thirſt and reſtleſsneſs; in ſome, when the buſineſs began to grow better, after three or four fits, cold and ſhivering began the fits, and the Feaver became an exact inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Tertian: But in moſt, the Feaver ſtill grew worſe, and preſently became of an evil nature, and difficult Cure, with a depraved proviſion of ſymptoms; for when the ſick were highly heated in their fits, and hardly ſweated, they were wont to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit errors, which daily increaſed the ſtrength of the Diſeaſe, becauſe by reaſon of the inpatience of the ſick, and the unskilfulneſs of Servants, the ſweat being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, which ſhould have ended the fit of the Feaver, after one fit was ſcarce finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, another preſently ſucceeded, and ſo the Diſeaſe was wont to have wandring and uncertain periods, without any intermiſſion betweene and afterwards to paſs into a kind of continual Feaver. The condition of which, ſometimes being very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, with an evil affection of the Brain and nervous ſtock, ſo that oftentimes a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, or Delirium, or not ſeldom cramps, and Convulſive motions, were excited: About the month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> this Feaver began to ſpread far and near, among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that in every Region and Village many were ſick of it; but it was much more frequent in the Country, and ſmaller Villages, than in Cities or Towns. It was ſtill like an intermitting Feaver, unleſs that it ſeemed more infeſtous than that is wont, and with more cruel fits, and ſhorter intermiſſions, and therefore was called
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:152521:88"/>
the new Diſeaſe: beſides, it underwent the note of a certain malignity, and gave knowledg of its Contagion and Deadlineſs; inſomuch, that it crept from houſe to houſe, infected with the ſame evil, moſt of the ſame Family, and eſpecially thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly converſing with the ſick; yea, old Men, and Men of ripe Age, it ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took away.</p>
                        <p>If you reſpect the nature and eſſence of the Diſeaſe, this Feaver properly ſhould be referred to the rank of intermitting Feavers, for the fits returned at ſet times, alſo for the moſt part they began with cold and ſhivering, and ofteneſt with vomiting, and by and by a moſt intenſe heat proceeding, they were finiſhed at laſt with a ſweat. The Urine in moſt appeared of a flame colour, thin in the fits, with ſome hypoſtaſis, without it more thick, and with a rediſh ſediment; altho with a moſt copious ſweat, and often iterated, the Diſeaſe was not cured, which might be expected in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Feaver; yea, the diſtemper continued exceeding long, for many days, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times months, tho much evacuation almoſt daily hapned by vomit and ſweat: which we obſerve frequently in an intermitting Feaver, rarely to happen in a continual; out of the fit, at any time of the Diſeaſe a purge was profitably inſtituted, which in a Synochus before the ſign of concoction, were a wicked thing to attempt; beſides, that this Feaver was of the intermitting kind, it ſeems to appear from hence, becauſe very many recovered of it, that ſcarce one of a thouſand died, which I ſcarce ever knew in an Epidemical Synochus. About the firſt beginnings of this Diſeaſe, it appeared very like to an intermitting Tertian, altho afterwards in ſome, by reaſon of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious proviſion of their body, and errors committed in Dyet, and ſweating, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to change into a continual; for in whom the fits were not rightly concluded, nor ended in a remiſſion, by reaſon of the morbific matter not being throughly diſperſed, their Blood was continually hot: from whence it came to paſs, that the fits ſooner returned, and continued longer; till at length, by reaſon of the plenty of matter, and the languiſhment of Nature, the Blood being made weaker, endeavoured no longer to ſwell up, and to ſeparate the feaveriſh matter at ſet hours, but to ſubdue it by little and little, with a continual effervency.</p>
                        <p>We are to inquire concerning the cauſes of this Diſeaſe, what may be the leading, evident, and conjunct cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> by the means of which it ſpread ſo generally, and became Epidemical through all <hi>England;</hi> by what means, and for what occaſion, it was wont to be excited in all men: and laſtly, what kind of alteration of the Blood and humors, being induced, brought forth this kind of Feaver, with ſuch a proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſymptoms, and conſerved it in the Act.</p>
                        <p>I know it is eaſie to place wholly the cauſe of this ſo popular Diſeaſe in the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant conſtitution of the Air, to wit, that the Particles of the Air, in which we breath, were infected by a certain extraneous Infection, and not agreeable to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the little bodies of which Infections being admitted within, did ferment with the Blood and humors, and ſo in moſt, brought in this Feaver, almoſt with the ſame appearance of ſymptoms. For who dares deduce the original of a Diſeaſe ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally raging, from a leſs public fountain? or refer to any other place, the received cauſes of Diſeaſes, than to that neſt of Vital Air, on which every one ſeeds? But whilſt I more attentively conſider the thing, it ſeems to me, that its ſtem, and as it were its firſt beginnings, are to be ſought a little deeper. To wit, that this Feaver is born not from the Contagion communicated by the Air, and immediately fixing its evil on men, but rather from a certain feaveriſh prediſpoſition or nature, impreſſed ſomewhile before on our Bodies, becauſe of the intemperance of the Year, which at length having gotten maturity, on the leaſt occaſion is brought into Act, and ſo breaks not forth into this Feaver, ſo much as it ſifts it forth.</p>
                        <p>For when about the Calends of <hi>July,</hi> the Air was immoderately hot, with a moſt intenſe heat for many days, is eaſily altered our Blood towards an hot and bilous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, by which (as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                           </gap>ine growing more hot than it ſhould do) the ſweet part, and the ſpirituous was much conſumed, in the mean time, the Saline and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous was too much carried forth, that by that means, the Liquor eaſily contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a rancor or ſourneſs: We have in another place ſhewn, that this kind of diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Blood, whereby indeed it turns from a ſweet and ſpirituous temper, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a bilous or choleric, is moſt apt for intermitting Feavers: Hence the alible juice, which is continually carried into the maſs of Blood, is not rightly concocted nor aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilated into Blood, but perverted as it were into an extraneous and fermentative matter: which ariſing to a fulneſs in the boſom of the Blood it ſelf, and growing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:152521:88"/>
turgid according to its increaſe at ſet periods, as we have already ſhewn, induces the fits of the intermitting Feaver: when therefore, from the great burning heat of this Summer, the Blood almoſt of all men, becoming more hot than uſual, was very much ſcorched, it is no wonder, if from thence it ſhould contract a great aptitude for intermitting Feavers. But why not whilſt the fervor of the Heaven was yet urgent, but a little after, this Diſeaſe ſpread it ſelf, the reaſon is, becauſe this indiſpoſition is not impreſſed on our Blood at once, or at one time, but by little and little, and not but of a long time; and therefore, Diſeaſes like Fruits, are chiefly ripened in Autumn, after the foregoing heat of the Summer.</p>
                        <p>This aptitude or feaveriſh diſpoſition, all do not contract alike; thoſe whoſe Blood is of a more hot Nature, and abounds more in Sulphur, and for that cauſe is ſooner ſcorched, alſo ſuch who labour, or ſtay long in the heat of the Sun, and open Air, by reaſon of their Blood being more remarkably torrified, more eaſily fell into this Diſeaſe; wherefore, at firſt, it chiefly raged among Husbandmen in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: of theſe, who had acquired an aptitude to this Feaver, from the Blood being before ſcorched, ſome perhaps fell into this of their own accord, the feaveriſh diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition being leiſurely carried forth to a maturity; others, by reaſon of a light occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or evident cauſe, which was wont otherways to ſtir up the feaveriſh burning, as from taking Cold, Surfeit, drinking of Wine, and the like; and others fell ſick from the Contagion received of others, for as the <hi>effluvia</hi> conſtantly came away from the ſick, when they pierced Bodies prediſpoſed to the like diſtemper, they eaſily excited the hid powers into Act.</p>
                        <p>As to the third Propoſition, to wit, that the conjunct cauſe of this Diſeaſe, and its formal Reaſon, may be known, we muſt put you in mind of thoſe things, which we have elſewhere delivered concerning the nature of intermitting Feavers; for we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the retorrid and bilous conſtitution of the Blood, as the baſis of this Diſeaſe, by reaſon of which, the alible juice, being ſupplied daily, as it were in a certain meaſure, is not rightly concocted, but by the aſſation or ſcorching, becomes or goes into a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative matter, not miſcible with the Blood. When the Blood is filled to a full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with this matter (which happens at ſet intervals of times, becauſe the alible juice is ſupplied as it were by a ſet meaſure) it of its own accord conceives a ſwelling up, and the growing hot or efferveſcency being excited, for the carrying away of this matter, cauſes the feaveriſh fit: which ſo long indures, till this feaveriſh matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inkindled, and as it were burnt in the heart, is wholly diſſipated with ſweat.</p>
                        <p>From theſe things premiſed, it is made plain, that in this diſtemper, we now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of, there are ſome things happen by a peculiar way, from the common kind of intermitting Feavers, and therefore it was noted, and that not undeſervedly, with the appellation of a New Feaver; which are, Firſt, That about the beginning of the Diſeaſe, fits did a long while afflict the ſick, without cold or ſhaking, but with a moſt intenſe heat, thirſt, and cruel vomiting; by which, the ſweat hardly, and for the moſt part partial, and often interrupted, ſucceeded, whereby the fit was not finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but of a long time. The reaſon of which, may be only laid upon the very cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leric diſpoſition of the Blood, and being above meaſure ſcorched: For this proceeding from the domineering Sulphur, wholly inhibits the wonted ſourneſs of the Blood, which follows its turgency or ſwelling up, and is wont to ſtir up the cold or ſhiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and by reaſon of this kind of temper of the Blood, too much roaſting and as it were burning the alible juice, the Blood growing turgid, together with that juice, and being ſtirred up into motion, is inkindled more than it is wont in the heart, and by its deflagration, induces a moſt intenſe and troubleſome heat, with thirſt, to the ſick. Cholerick vomitings, happen not only at the beginning, but in the middle of the fit, by reaſon of the abundance of choler, with which, the Choleduct Veſſels being too much filled, infuſe the inteſtines; which then, a Convulſion being ſtirred up, is eaſily emptied into the Ventricle: ſweat hardly ſucceeds, becauſe the bile abounds more than the ſerum, wherefore the feaveriſh matter being burnt, it is not eaſily ſifted forth by ſweat but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either mingled with the Blood, cauſes the long effervency, or being carried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the inteſtines, produces Vomiting, or a Flux. Secondly, This Feaver differs from the vulgar intermitting Feaver, becauſe after the fit was ended, there was no full intermiſſion, even to a remiſſion, but the ſick ſtill remained languiſhing and thirſty; and as to appetite, ſleep, and other accidents, very ill: which indeed hapned, becauſe, by the intenſe heat of the fit, more of the Blood and feaveriſh matter is inkindled, than that its recrements remaining after its deflagration, are able preſently to be diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:152521:89"/>
eſpecially, becauſe the ſweat, by reaſon of the dryneſs of the matter, very hardly ſucceeds, nor is the feaveriſh matter enough diluted with the ſerous <hi>Latex,</hi> to be ſifted forth; wherefore, the Blood by its Contagion, in the time of the fit, not being perfectly freed, grows hot ſtill, neither the fit being ended, doth it get any full truce from the Diſeaſe: In the mean time, whilſt the Blood is urged after this manner, with almoſt a continual effervency, it differs from a Synochus; becauſe in this, the Sulphureous part of the Blood, being too much carried forth, and as it were inflamed, cauſes the Feaver by its deflagration; but the continual ebullition, which after this manner comes upon this intermitting Feaver, wholly depends upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the not miſcible matter, and its hard ſecretion from the Blood. The Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus happens like Wine growing hot of its own accord, by reaſon of its richneſs, the other conceives its fury, like the ſame Wine, by reaſon of ſome heterogeneous thing poured to it: wherefore we remark, that whilſt our Feaver is ſeen ſtill to be continual, it is not cured by ſweat or the Flux of the Belly, altho they frequently and copiouſly happen: becauſe it depending upon the Blood being depauperated, rather than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inflamed, it continues long, and diſpoſes the ſick towards a Cachexie,</p>
                        <p n="3">3. There is a third reaſon of difference, by which this Feaver may be diſtinguiſhed from the common rank of intermitting Feavers, and it is this, that it is eaſily propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to others by Contagion; the reaſon of which is, becauſe here very many bodies are prediſpoſed after the ſame manner, towards the ſame diſtemper, which happens not at another time; wherefore, the meer effluvias from a diſeaſed Body, are able to excite the like effect, in a very fit ſubject; even as ſome Beams of Flame enkindle Flame, in a very combuſtible matter: In the mean time all do not alike contract the Infection of this Feaver, but that ſome being leſs prepared or fitted for it, converſe with the ſick without harm.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. There is another ſymptom occurs, not conſtant to this Feaver, but only hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in ſome places, that diſcriminates it not only from the common, but varies its own proper type; to wit, ſometimes it happens, this Diſeaſe to be accompanied with a Dyſenterick diſtemper; in ſome cholerick Vomits, and bilous Stools very much infeſt, and in others Bloody Stools follow, with cruel pains and torments of the Belly. The former I often obſerved in our Neigbourhood, and the reaſon of it may be deduced from the highly bilous temper of the Blood: For by reaſon of this, the aduſt matter, not to be diſſipated by ſweat, is copiouſly ſifted into the Liver; then by reaſon of the choler-carrying Veſſels, being filled to a flowing over, it is ſent away to the Ventricle, and Inteſtines. The other Dyſenterical diſtemper, was found only in ſome places, and there peculiar rather than common, it laid hold only of ſome ſick. The origine of it may be referred to the peculiar diſpoſitions of ſome Bodies, or viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proviſion, alſo to the ſite of the place, or condition of the Air; then the Diſeaſe is to be ſuſpected, to be thence tranſlated to others, not without the communication of a certain Infection.</p>
                        <p>There is to be had a double Prognoſtication concerning this Diſeaſe: Firſt, of the Feaver in General, what end it ſhall have, and when; what it may threaten to the Land: whether it precede not (which is commonly feared) the Plague, or Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Sickneſſes. Secondly, The ſigns ought to be laid down, whereby we are wont to preſage health, or danger, in the various caſes of the ſick.</p>
                        <p>As to the Firſt, Becauſe we have ſhown that the Origine of this diſtemper is not to be fetched from the Contagion of the Air, or its being infected with any venomous Infection, nor from any malignant ſeeds of Vapours diffuſed through the Air, but only from the ſignal bilous temper or diſpoſition of our Bodies, with the Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made aduſt and roaſted extremely, by reaſon of the Summer heats, I think there is no reaſon of fear, that this Feaver ſhould be carried forth into any thing worſe, by the vice of the Air, or might at length grow to be Malignant or Peſtilential. But rather (that the ſeaſon of the Year being changed, and the alteration of our Blood aſſuredly to be expected) we might fear leſt this Feaver, which now imitates the way of an intermitting Feaver, ſhould afterwards paſs into a Quartane, the Blood growing into a melancholy temper. Which thing indeed I obſerved to happen to ſome already, and I believe, that before the Autumn be fully paſſed over, will happen to many more.</p>
                        <p>As to the particular Prognoſtication, the chiefly notable ſigns, which occur in the courſe of this Feaver, and in a manner foretel its condition and event, are of this ſort; if the Diſeaſe happens in a firm Body, well tempered, and eaſily perſpirable;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:152521:89"/>
if vomiting with eaſe ſucceeds, and that the Belly be looſe: if the fit begins with a light ſhivering, and afterwards a moderate heat, with ſweat concludes it, and that the intermiſſion be with ſome tolerable remiſſion; if the Pulſe be ſtrong, the Urine of a flame colour, clear, and with a laudable hypoſtaſis, we may Predict that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe will quickly end without any danger. But if this Feaver be excited in a fat Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and or a vitious habit, it with troubleſome vomiting, an intolerable thirſt, and fierce heat, long exerciſe the ſick; if to the heat a difficult ſweat, and partial, and often interrupted, and between frequent vomitings ſucceed, and that it ends not in a remiſſion, we may declare, that this Diſeaſe may be long, and of a dangerous iſſue. But if the ſick remain in ſtrength, and the Urine ſhew ſigns of concoction, we need not deſpair of health; eſpecially, if after four or five periods, the Diſeaſe, as it is wont to do, remits of its wonted fierceneſs. Thirdly we obſerve, if this Diſeaſe is excited in an old Body, or others broken with ſickneſſes, or debilitated; if beſides horrid vomitings, there happen ſwoonings, faintings, Deliriums or Lethargic di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers; if after many fits, the ſick having loſt their ſtrength, the Diſeaſe remits nothing, but exerciſeth the Blood, with a continual effervency, and that the Vital Spirits are much deſtroyed; if the appetite be loſt, wakings pertinacious, and that they have Convulſive motions, with a weak Pulſe, and Urine troubled, or thick, we judg the matter to be full of danger: yet is not the ſick to be left as deſperate, becauſe the Diſeaſe is not haſty, and kills not ſuddenly, and out of hand; but is drawn out at length, and grants time and occaſions to nature, of recollecting her ſelf, and to the Phyſician, of giving Remedies.</p>
                        <p>The Therapeutic Indications, which have place in the Cure of this Feaver, are chiefly four. Firſt, That the Blood being now ſcorched, and made too choloric, may be reduced to its due temper. Secondly, That the depravation of the nouriſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble juice, and its alteration into a fermentative matter, may be inhibited, or at leaſt leſſned. Thirdly, That about the declining of the Diſeaſe, the Blood depauperated by a frequent deflagration, and made more impure by the fuſion or pouring into it the morbifick or aduſt matter, may be reſtored, and rendred as it ſhould be volatile. Fourthly, That the ſymptoms, which chiefly infeſt in the courſe of the Diſeaſe, may be timely helped, by fit Remedies; that theſe intentions may be ſatisfied, I counſel that this following method be uſed.</p>
                        <p>About the beginning of the Diſeaſe, if the bilous or cholorie humor, flowing forth of the choler bearing Veſſels, and being ſuffuſed into the Venticle, cauſe the ſick to be prone to vomiting, let a more plentiful evacuation be procured, by a gentle Emetie in the time of the fit: The opening of a Vein, and Purging, ought not to be adminiſtred, unleſs between the fits: for whilſt the Blood grows mainly hot, or is reſolved into ſweat, Nature ought not to be called back from the Work begun, nor her endeavours to be diſturbed, by the preſcriptions of Phyſicians; wherefore, after the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> being paſt, and the ſweat throughly finiſhed, a Purging may be inſtituted, by a gentle Cathartic, and the ſame afterwards ſometimes repeated, on the like occaſion: for by this method, not only the proviſion of the excrementitious matter, is brought away, from the firſt paſſages, but chiefly the choler-bearing Veſſels being emptied, the choler is copiouſly drawn forth from the maſs of Blood, and by that means the Blood is reſtored to its natural Craſis or diſpoſition. The Letting of Blood, if it be indicated, ſhould be performed preſently after the beginning; for ſo its Liquor being too turgent or ſwelling up, is eventilated, whereby both the nutritious juice is leſs perverted, and the fit urging, it burns forth with a leſs heat, together with the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick matter: but otherwiſe, if a Vein be opened after a long ſickneſs, when the Blood being made poorer, and more watry, more of the morbific matter is heaped together, and does not rightly concoct, and ſift it forth, it detracts much from the ſtrength of Nature, and nothing from the power of the Diſeaſe. In the interval of the fits, when there is no place for opening a Vein, nor Purging, let the Belly be kept looſe, by the conſtant uſe of Clyſters; alſo digeſtive Remedies, of acetous or ſaline Liquors and Powders, are to be exhibited; of which ſort are, Cream of Tartar fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Salts of Herbs, Tartar Vitriolate, Harts-horn burnt, Spirit of Vitriol, and Salt, &amp;c. for theſe reſtore the loſt, or ſleepy ferments of the Viſcera, purifie the Blood by fuſing it, alſo ſeparate the morbific matter, and as it were precipitate it: alſo, at this time, between, if pertinations waking infeſt the ſick, and overthrow their ſtrength, it may be lawful to adminiſter anodyne, and gentle narcotic Remedies; but never in the fit: for then they greatly hinder the ſubduing, and ſifting forth of the feaveriſh matter, and draw out in length the fit that would end ſooner.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="168" facs="tcp:152521:90"/>Theſe things are to be done about the interſtitia, or intervals of the fits; but whilſt the fit is urgent, altho the ſick then chiefly ſend for, and call upon Phyſiicans, yet at this time their preſcripts are limited to a narrower ſpace: If Vomiting (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding an Emetic being given) ſtill infeſt, it may be more freely provoked, either by ſimple Poſſet Drink, or with bitter Herbs boyled in it: But let the chiefeſt means of help be, in temperating the heat and thirſt, which moſt grievouſly torments the ſick in this Feaver: For whilſt the Blood growing hot, with the morbific matter, and being inkindled in the Heart, leaps forth into the Lungs, ſtirs up there a cruel Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which requires a profuſion of a cold humor as it were for the extinguiſhing the Flame; wherefore they greedily deſire without any meaſure drink, for want of which the ſick are almoſt killed with too great heat, and their Blood being almoſt wholly rarified into flame and fume, the thrid of Circulation is hardly continued; wherefore, drink ought to be wholly granted, to thoſe in Feavers: which however, if it be taken in too large a quantity, it at firſt more diſturbs the eſtuating Blood, and at length brings confuſion to the feaveriſh matter, begun to be ſeparated; that from thence, the Work of ſubaction and ſecretion is longer protacted, and the fit is made longer: alſo, beſides, large drinking cauſes troubles in the Ventricle, and by diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and often provoking Vomiting, hinders the breathing forth, and calls inward the ſweat breaking forth, or perhaps already broke forth: wherefore, at firſt, the heat of the Feaver being inkindled, altho the ſick be very thirſty, let them only ſip a little, and abſtain from drink as much as they can; afterwards, when the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burnt, and ſubdued, begins to be diſſipated by ſweat, they may be more freely indulged as to this, for ſo the ſweating is greatly helped, and the fit is ſooner finiſhed: as to the nature of the Drink, let them take ſometimes Poſſet Drink, ſometimes Small Beer, or Barly Water, and ſometimes ſimple Water, or ſharpned with the juice of Lemons: In this caſe, the uſe of Sal Prunellae is deſervedly praiſed, to be given in every Liquor; for this, with its nitroſity, wonderfully allays the raging Blood, and potently moves ſweats, I have often obſerved, in the midſt of a fit, the ſick wont to fall into a ſwoon, or ſyncopy, to whom preſently they give Cordials or hot Waters that much increaſe the violence of the Feaver, and bring forth more troubles than uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that the fit is more difficultly finiſhed: But theſe faintings, for the moſt part, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, either from a bilous humor ſuffuſed in the Ventricle, or by reaſon of the ſweat ſuddenly breaking forth; and againſt theſe I always found the moſt preſent Remedy, that either a feather being put down the throat, Vomiting may be provoked, or that Liquor being plentifully drunk, a ſweat may be again raiſed up: alſo, in the whole courſe of this Feaver, I am wont never to give any Cordials, or alexiteriums.</p>
                        <p>The Dyet in this Feaver ought to be only ſlender, and not nouriſhing, all ſorts of Fleſh, or any thing prepared of them, are wholly to be avoided; for as theſe abound with Sulphur, they give a more plentiful food (as Oyl poured on Flame) to the hot or enkindled Blood: beſides, nothing ſpiritous, as ſtrong Waters, ſtrong Beer, or Wine, is to be yielded to; but Decoctions, or Broths of Oat-meal, or Barly, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with cooling Herbs, are chiefly to be uſed; alſo Poſſet Drink, and ſmall Beer, or Whey, is to be given them at their pleaſure: for by this means, when a very ſlender and watry nouriſhing juice, is conveyed to the maſs of Blood, the ſoluted Particles of Sulphur, burn forth ſooner, and with the leſs tumult; alſo the recrements of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſt matter, are more eaſily carried from the boſom of the Blood: but if on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, a more rich or plentiful nouriſhment be adminiſtred, the effervency of the Blood is thereby very much augmented, and the Blood is more infected, by the confuſion or pouring in of the aduſt matter.</p>
                        <p>After that the Blood being much burnt forth by frequent fits, and the Feaver being in its declination, remits of its fervor and fierceneſs, you muſt take heed, leſt the ſick at length growing well, fall not into a Cachexie, or Scorbutic Diſtemper: for the diſpoſition of the Viſcera being hurt, and the Blood very much depauperated, the alible juice, though not ſcorched ſo as at firſt, is not however rightly concocted, and ripened into perfect Blood: but by reaſon of the want of tranſpiration, the ſerous excrements, being imbued with a fixed ſalt, are greatly heaped together, and now fixed in the Bowels, now in the extreme parts, bring forth various Diſtempers. Wherefore in a long languiſhing of the ſick, or otherwiſe for the ſake of being ſooner well, Remedies ſhould be given them, which volatiliſe the Blood, or hinder the ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fings of the Viſcera, or if ſtuffed, may open them, and their ferments as if extinct, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore: for this uſe, thoſe Remedies and Preparations chiefly help, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

                        <head>The Deſcription of a Catarrhal Feaver Epidemical in the middle of the Spring, in the Year <hi>1658.</hi> taken the fourth of <hi>June.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>AN equally intenſe Froſt followed the next Winter, the immoderate heat of the foregoing Summer, ſo that no one living could remember ſuch a Year, for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exceſs both of heat and cold. From the Ides of <hi>December,</hi> almoſt to the vernal Equinox, the Earth was covered with ſnow, and the North wind conſtantly blowing, all things without doors were frozen: alſo, afterwards, from the beginning of the Spring, almoſt to the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> the ſame Wind ſtill blowing, the ſeaſon was more like Winter than Spring; unleſs now and then a hot day came between. During the Winter (unleſs that a Quartan Feaver contracted in Autumn infeſted ſome) among our Countrimen, there was a moderate ſtate of health, and freedom from all popular Diſeaſes. The Spring coming on, an intermitting Tertian (as uſed to do every year before) fell upon ſome. About the end of <hi>April,</hi> ſuddenly a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper aroſe, as it ſent by ſome blaſt of the Stars, which laid hold on very many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: that in ſome Towns, in the ſpace of a Week, above a thouſand people fell ſick together. The particular ſymptom of this Diſeaſe, and which firſt invaded the ſick, was a troubleſome Cough, with great ſpitting, alſo a Catarrh, falling down on the palat, throat, and noſtrils; alſo it was accompanied with a feaveriſh Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, joyned with heat and thirſt, want of appetite, a ſpontaneous wearineſs, and a grievous pain in the Back and Limbs: which Feaver however was more remiſs in ſome, that they could go abroad, and follow their affairs in the time of their ſickneſs, but complaining in the mean time, of want of ſtrength, and of languiſhing, a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of food, a Cough, and a Catarrh: But in ſome a very hot Diſtemper plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that being thrown into Bed they were troubled with burning, thirſt, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, hoarſneſs, and coughing, almoſt continual; ſomtimes there came upon this a bleeding at Noſe, and in ſome a bloody ſpittle, and frequently a Bloody Flux, ſuch as were indued with an infirm Body, or men of a more declining Age, that were taken with this Diſeaſe, not a few died of it; but the more ſtrong, and almoſt all of an healthful conſtitution recovered: thoſe who falling ſick of this Diſeaſe, and died, for the moſt part died by reaſon of the ſtrength being leiſurely waſted, and a ſerous heap more and more gathered together in the Breaſt, with the Feaver being increaſed, and a difficulty of breath, like thoſe ſick of an Hectic Feaver. Concerning this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, we are to inquire, what procatartic cauſe it had; that it ſhould ariſe in the middle of the Spring ſuddenly, and that the third part of Mankind almoſt, ſhould be diſtempered with the ſame, in the ſpace of a Month: then the ſigns and ſymptoms being carefully collated, the formal reaſon of this Diſeaſe, alſo its Criſis and way of Cure ought to be aſſigned.</p>
                        <p>That the Northern Wind is moſt apt to produce Catarrhs, beſides the teſtimony of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> common experience doth make known: but why Catarrhs did not ſpread, at leaſt in ſome peculiar places, all the Winter and Spring, but only in one months ſpace, and then joyned with a Feaver, this Diſtemper ſhould become Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical, doth not ſo plainly appear. I know many deduce the cauſe from the unequal temper of the Air, at that time; which altho for the moſt part very cold, yet the North Wind ſometimes leſſening, there would be a day or two very hot between: wherefore, from this occaſion, as from cold taken after the heat, men ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fall ſick: But indeed, for the exciting the Diſtemper, ſo ſuddenly riſing, and commonly ſpreading, there is required, beſides ſuch an occaſion, a great foregoing cauſe or prediſpoſition, tho the other might ſuffice perhaps, for an evident cauſe, for to diſtemper them with this ſickneſs; for we ought to ſuppoſe, that almoſt all men were prone to the receiving this Diſeaſe, otherwiſe no evident cauſe could have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed its power ſo potently on ſo many, wherefore, it ſeems very likely, that this Diſeaſe had its Origine from the intemperance and great inordination of the year: and as the Autumnal intermitting Feaver before deſcribed, was the product of the preceding immoderate heat, ſo this Catarrhal Feaver, depended altogether upon the following part of the year, being ſo extremely cold: For the Blood being now throughly roaſted by the very hot Summer, and prone to the Feaver before deſcribed,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:152521:91"/>
then being made more ſouriſh by the Autumn urging it, and apt for a Quartan Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, afterwards being a little eventilated by reaſon of the ſtrong cold of the Winter, and hindred from its due perſpiration, retained yet its Dyſcraſie, or evil diſpoſition, and readily broke forth on the firſt occaſion given: wherefore, when the Blood, in the middle of the Spring, (as the juice of Vegetables) being made more lively, and alſo begun to flower and grow rank, by reaſon of the ſtoppage being ſtill continued, was ſtraitned in its Circulation, and eaſily made prone to a feaveriſh efferveſcency: and as the ſerous Water redounding in the Blood, could not evaporate outwardly, becauſe of the Pores being ſtill ſtraitned by the cold, reſtagnating within, and chiefly falling upon the Lungs, (where it might be moved about, inſtead of an outward breathing forth) excited the ſo frequent and troubleſom Cough.</p>
                        <p>The Original therefore, and formal Reaſon of this Diſeaſe, are founded chiefly on two things, to wit, that there together hapned a greater efferveſcency of the Blood than uſual, from the coming on of the Spring ſeaſon, and alſo a ſtoppage, or great conſtriction of the Pores, excited by the too great cold of the foregoing ſeaſon; that therefore there was not a free ſpace granted to the Blood, flowring or luxuriating in the Veſſels: The buſineſs being after the ſame manner, as if Wine begun to grow hot, ſhould be put up into cloſe ſhut Veſſels, for by this means, either the Veſſels, or the Liquor, were in danger to be loſt.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore, that we may contract the thing in ſhort, the cauſe that this Diſeaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the middle of the Spring, having preſently ſpread largely, ſeiſed very many, was not the blaſt of a malignant Air, whereby the ſick were diſtempered, as if ſtruck with a blaſting, but that at this time, the Blood being inſpired by the conſtitution of the Spring, and ſo luxuriating, and apt to grow hot, was contracted or ſtraitned in its motion, and, the effluvias being conſtrained inwardly, could not be ſufficiently eventilated or cooled. In every year, tho temperate, it is uſual in the Spring and Autumn for ſome Epidemical Diſeaſes to reign, becauſe at this time, the Blood being as it were reſtored, flowers anew; and therefore, intermitting Feavers, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Small Pox ordinarily ſpread in this ſeaſon; wherefore, 'tis no wonder, after a great unequal conſtitution of the year, and not natural, when in this Spring, the Blood boyling up more lively within the Veſſels, by reaſon of tranſpiration being hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, could not be freely circulated, and ſufficiently eventilated, if for that cauſe, great diſorders follow, and from this moſt common cauſe, a diſtemper greatly Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical ſhould be excited.</p>
                        <p>As to the ſymptoms joyned with this Diſeaſe, a feaveriſh intemperature, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever belongs to this, the heat of the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> thirſt, a ſpontaneous wearineſs, pain in the Head, Loyns, and Limbs, were induced from the Blood growing hot, and not ſufficiently eventilated: hence in many, a part of the thinner Blood being heated, and the reſt of the Liquor being only driven into confuſion, a ſimple Synochus, or of more days was induced, and this for the moſt part ceaſed within a few days: But in ſome endued with a vitious diſpoſition of Blood, or evil habit of Body, this kind of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ariſing by reaſon of the ſame cauſe, quickly paſſed into a very dangerous Putrid Feaver, and often Mortal.</p>
                        <p>The Cough accompanying this Feaver with a Catarrh, draws its Origine from a ſerous humor heaped up together in the Blood, by reaſon of tranſpiration being hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred for a long time, and then an efferveſcency being riſen, dropping forth more from the little Arteries, gaping within: for when the Pores are conſtrained, the ſuperfluous ſeroſities in the Blood, being wont to evaporate outwardly, are poured forth on the Lungs, by a proper caſtration or cleanſing of the Blood, wherefore, by taking cold, (as they commonly term it) that is, from tranſpiration outwardly being hindred, the Cough for the moſt part is ſtirred up: And for a foregoing cauſe to this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the flowing forth of the ſerum into the maſs of Blood, hath for the moſt part the chief place; for, from the long cold hindring the ſcorching of the Blood, or the proviſion of the bile, and prohibiting the breathing forth of the watry humor, there was a neceſſity, that very much of the ſerous humor ſhould be heaped up in the Blood: wherefore, when the Blood flowring in the Spring, conceived an heat, the flowing forth of the ſerum, and a pouring of it on the interior parts, was wont to cauſe firſt the Cough, as the proper ſymptom of this Diſeaſe: and thoſe, whoſe Blood was more diluted by the mixtion of the ſerum, and who were greatly obnoxious to the Cough and a Rheumatic Diſtemper, were cured with leſs trouble of the feaveriſh Diſtemper.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:152521:91"/>
the Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe, concerning private perſons, is for the moſt part eaſie, that one may deliver the event, from the firſt aſſault; for if this ſickneſs be excited in a ſtrong Body, and healthful before, and that the feaveriſh Diſtemper be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and without any grievous and horrid ſymptom, the buſineſs is free from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the Diſtemper is to be accounted but of light moment, as that commonly is of catching cold, neither needs a Phyſician be conſulted, nor Remedies, unleſs trivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and ordinary, be adminiſtred: But if this Diſtemper happens in a weak and ſickly Body, with an evil proviſion, or that the Feaver being carried into a Putrid Feaver, or the Cough growing grievous, induces difficult breathing, and as it were a tabid or Conſumptive diſpoſition, the event of the Diſeaſe is much to be ſuſpected, and often terminates in Death. The common Prognoſtic, that was taken from hence, concerning the future ſtate of the year, conteins nothing to be feared, or ominates any great ill; by reaſon of the unequal intemperance of the year, the great heats, and then exceſſive cold, we might fear Diſeaſes to ariſe from the Dyſcraſie of the Blood, yet from the preſent condition, we need neither ſuſpect any noted depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Air, or Infection with poyſonous breaths; that from thence may be had any judgment of the Plague, or Malignant Diſeaſe to be at hand.</p>
                        <p>As to what belongs to the Cure; when this Diſeaſe is more lightly inflicted, its Cure for the moſt part is left to Nature: for this Feaver, when it is only a ſimple Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nochus, is wont to be cured within a few days by ſweat: wherefore, by a copious ſweating, for the moſt part about the third or fourth day, the heat, and thirſt, the wearineſs, and heavy pains are allayed; then the Cough being ſomewhat longer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, by little and little afterwards remits, and at length the ſick leiſurely grow well; if this Diſeaſe hath rooted it ſelf more deeply, there is need of fit Remedies, and an exact method of curing, the Feaver growing worſe is to be healed, according to the Rules to be obſerved in a Putrid Feaver: but nevertheleſs with this difference, that, becauſe tranſpiration being hindred, and the ſuffuſion of the ſerous humor on the Lungs, are chiefly in fault, therefore Diaphoretic Remedies, and thoſe called pectoral are of more frequent uſe, for theſe reſtrain the flowing forth of the ſerum, from the Veſſels within, or by opening the Pores convey it forth of doors; or precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it from the boſom of the Blood, ſend it forth be the urinary paſſages; therefore the method of Medicine for this Diſeaſe, being brought into the worſer ſtate, reſpects both the feaveriſh intemperance, for the ſake of curing which you are to be directed, according to the intentions ſhewn in the Putrid Feaver, and alſo the Rheumatic Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, which however let it be ſecondary, and not every expectorating Remedy, or thoſe uſed againſt a Cough are to be admitted, but of that kind only which do not increaſe the Feaver: the forms of theſe, and the means of curing, are to be ſought from the precepts, delivered generally for the Cure of the Putrid Feaver, and of the Cough; the helps, which now, by frequent experience, are commonly ſaid to bring Cure chiefly in this Diſeaſe, are ſweating, or the provoking of ſweat, and letting of Blood: for the Veſſels being emptied by this or that means, both the immoderate heat of the Blood, and the abundance of the ſerum, are reſtrained.</p>

                        <p>THE vernal Feaver but now deſcribed, did not laſt longer than ſix weeks, that it plainly was ſeen, that it was only a more light flowring of the Blood, which ſwelling up in the Spring, and at the ſame time ſtreightned in ſpace, for want of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilation, moſt impetuouſly boyled up, like new Wine cloſe ſhut up in Bottles, and then ceaſed of it ſelf. Yet from thence, as neither the year, ſo neither our Blood did recover its due temperature, and ſo another tinder or neſt for a new Feaver, was quickly gathered together. Becauſe after the Summer ſolſtice, the North wind ſtill blowing, a cold ſeaſon remained for a long while; ſo that the Fruit and Corn this year, was feared by the Husbandmen, would ſcarce be throughly ripened; but after this, a little before the beginning of July, a moſt fierce heat followed, for ſeveral days: and when the Dog days were begun, the Air grew moſt cruelly hot, that one could ſcarce indure the open Air. By reaſon of this heat and cold in exceſs, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of this year was very unequal: wherefore, there was a neceſſity, for our Blood to be now fixed, and as it were congealed, now too much roaſted, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from its natural diſpoſition, to a ſcorched, and melancholly temper; alſo it
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:152521:92"/>
came to paſs that the Pores of the skin were much altered from their right conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that by that means, an inſenſible tranſpiration could not be performed, after the wonted manner.</p>
                        <p>From the time that the former Feaver ceaſed, almoſt to the end of the Dog days, there was a ſtate of health, and free from all popular Diſeaſes; but then a few here and there among the Villages, and in leſſer places, firſt fell ſick; but afterwards, about the end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> a new Feaver ſuddenly ariſing, began to ſpread through whole Regions, every-where round about us; alſo, this as the other which ſpread the laſt Autumn, raged chiefly in Country Houſes and Villages; but in the mean time, few of the Inhabitants of the greater Towns and Cities fell ſick. At the ſame time, in other Regions, ſituate at a diſtance from us, yea, almoſt throughout <hi>England,</hi> the Epidemical Feaver was ſaid to rage; and in ſome other places, to be far more deadly, than it was about our Country. Perhaps the Idea of this Feaver now reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had not the proviſion of its ſymptoms alike in all places, or was noted wholly with the ſame appearances and accidents: yet whatever it ſhewed in our parts, as to its nature, I ſhall briefly and ſuccinctly add, from our own proper obſervation, or what I had learnt, being communicated from others.</p>
                        <p>About the beginning of this Diſeaſe, its figure was wandring, and very uncertain; becauſe in ſome there was a continual fervor, in others it was intermitting, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by ſet fits; but at this time it hapned to very many, as a pathognomic ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, that they were ill in their brain, and nervous ſtock, that preſently from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beginning of this Feaver, almoſt all complained of their head being grievouſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered: For a cruel headach infeſted ſome, and hardneſs of hearing, with a noiſe in the ears troubled others, but to moſt was wont to happen, either a ſtupidneſs, and heavy ſleepineſs, with a vertiginous Diſtemper, or pertinacious wakings, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium, and diſtractions of the animal ſpirits. I have obſerved in ſome, that on the firſt or ſecond day of their ſickneſs, that little broad and red ſpots, like to the meaſles, have leiſurely broke forth in the whole body, which being ſhortly vaniſhed, the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preſently became ſtronger, and eſpecially the Diſtempers of the head, far more grievous. From thence a benumedneſs of the ſenſes, and a ſleepineſs fell upon ſome for many days, that they lay a long while as if dying, without ſpeaking, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of their friends. I knew others to have fallen from hence into a Lethargy, and others caſt into an Apoplexie, and ſome into a Phrenſie, and Delirium. Of theſe, the younger, and ſtrong men (yet not without a long languiſhment, and doubtful recovery) moſt of them eſcaped; in the mean time, old men, or other ways weak and ſickly, generally died. Thoſe who fell ſick with the Feaver, as it were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, with thoſe notes of malignity, were more rare, and the diſtempered were only ſporadically, in ſome houſes only. But the ſickneſs which moſt commonly ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, fell upon moſt, and tho it cruelly raged, it ſeemed to imitate an intermitting Feaver, to wit, either a Tertian, or a Quotidian: for that the ſick had fits, either every day, or (which I more often obſerved) every other day, which infeſted them grievouſly, and a long while, with cold, heat, and ſweat, ſucceeding in order: but theſe kind of fits, as alſo the courſe of the whole Diſeaſe, were wont to be noted with diverſity, according to the age and temper of the ſick; and with various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of ſymptoms, and accidents. Yet this was common to moſt of (I had like to have ſaid all) the ſick that together with the Feaver, they were troubled with Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalic Diſtempers.</p>
                        <p>When therefore any one was troubled with this Diſeaſe, (whether the ſickneſs was excited from an evident cauſe, or Contagion, or without any manifeſt occaſion) its coming betrayed it ſelf, by a pain in the head, and often in the loyns, with thirſt, want of appetite, ſpontaneous wearineſs, and heat tho not ſtrong: if it hapned in a young Body of a florid Blood, and more hot temper, the fits wanted the cold and ſhivering, about its beginning, but they were very troubleſome, and ſharp, with long heat: The ſick were often troubled with vomiting, and their head aked cruelly for the moſt part; ſweat difficulty ſucceeded, which being often partial and quickly broke off, rarely cured the fit, but when the ſweat failed, they grew hot again, that ſcarce in 18 or 24 hours the fit was finiſhed in ſome. In the mean time, from the Blood being very fervent, the phantaſie was diſturbed, that oftentimes a Deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, abſurd or idle talking, wakings, and high inquietudes were ſtirred up during the fit; but the ſame being finiſhed, in the time between, ſtill a troubleſome thirſt, a ſlow heat, languor of ſpirits, and great debility of ſtrength, with an headach, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:152521:92"/>
a vertiginous Diſtemper, for the moſt part moleſted them. It was rarely found, for any to find themſelves indifferently well, as in a common Tertian, between the fits. About the beginning of the Diſeaſe, the feaveriſh fierceneſſes were ſomewhat more mild, which afterwards at every turn, leiſurely grew worſe, and then began with cold and ſhaking; to which nevertheleſs, after a long and very troubleſome heat, ſweat very hardly ſucceeded in moſt, ſo that the fit rarely ended in its due temper. Within ſix or ſeven periods, the ſtrength of the ſick was much caſt down, that being made languid, and weak, they had an hard task to ſtruggle with the Diſeaſe: becauſe unleſs Nature were ſuccoured by Art, the Feaver ſtill prevailed, and rarely or never in a ſhort time, was it cured by a Criſis, or leiſurely remitted; but it brought the ſick into great ſtreights, by its long ſiege, and ſtill perſiſting, till the Blood being by its frequent deflagration made very liveleſs and watery, was unable to grow too hot in the Veſſels of its own accord, or to be inkindled more plentifully in the heart, and then oftentimes, became ſo dead, and wanting of ſpirits, that, being inſufficient for the continuing of the Vital Lamp, it brought in Death. But ſometimes the maſs of Blood being depraved, and made poor, by this Diſeaſe, was able (tho hardly) to continue the half extinct Vital Fire, and to renew it by little and little, with ſpirit and vigor, in a long time: yet in the mean time, after the heighth of this Diſeaſe, when the Blood being made more weak and impure, could not expel forth of doors this feaveriſh matter, or aduſt recrements, by a critical motion, it often transferred it to the Brain; and therefore about the height of this Feaver, a torpor, and ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of ſpirits, ſleepineſs, vertigo, tingling of the ears, tremblings, and convulſive motions, with a great oppreſſion of the whole animal faculty, were moſt often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
                        <p>Men of a more cold temperament, or in years, who were taken with this Diſeaſe, altho they were but little feaveriſh, were wont however to be in greater danger of Life; becauſe, in theſe, beſides the diſpoſition of the Blood, not eaſily reducible, alſo what was gathered together in the fits, that was extraneous and not to be mixed, was hardly ſubdued, and difficultly ſifted forth of the maſs of Blood; wherefore, both the Blood was ſtill more notably depraved in its Craſis, and in every fit more infected by the impure mixture: Moreover the nervous Liquor was greatly perverted from its due temper, and defiled moſt badly, by the aduſt recrements continually poured on the Brain. Therefore, when old men, melancholic, or otherways ſickly perſons, fell into this Feaver, they became, preſently after its firſt aſſault, ſtupified, and for the moſt part vertiginous: Tho in the fits, the heat was not very ſharp and piercing, they were however very unquiet, and ſtill toſſing about, oftentimes they talked idly, and at random; after a long burning, either no ſweat, or only partial, and often broke off, followed; whereby the fit was not fully helped, but that in the whole intervals, the ſick were thſrſty, and remained very ill, with a drineſs of the mouth, a ſcurfineſs of the Tongue, and a ſuffuſion of a viſcous filth. After ſome fits, their ſtrength being exceedingly caſt down, they were wholly fixed to their Beds, or riſe only for a little while, could ſcarce ſtand or ſet a foot before another, to move from place to place, or able to walk: in the mean time, they laboured with a languiſhment, a difficult breathing, a nummedneſs of ſenſes, and a great debility of the whole nervous ſtock: The Urine in moſt was highly red, of a more deep co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and of a thicker conſiſtency, than in a common Tertian: The Pulſe, whilſt the ſtrength was not wholly caſt down, for the moſt part was ſtrong and equal; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when the ſick became very languiſhing, it was weak and unequal, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes intermitting; to which alſo, conſtructures of the tendons, and convulſive motions in the wriſts, being joyned, were for the moſt part prognoſticks of Death. Thoſe who leiſurely being debilitated, declined towards Death, ſome little time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they died, lay for the moſt part without ſpeaking, or knowing thoſe about them, as it were ſtupid: and it rarely hapned in this Feaver, that any one about to die, was ſo perfect in their memory and intellect, as to diſpoſe of their Family affairs, or to take leave of their friends. But it hapned to thoſe who eſcaped, from a deep languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and almoſt deſperate condition, not quickly, or ſuddenly to recover, from their manifeſt evil diſpoſition, but lying a long while wavering, ſtupified, and without ſtrength, that Nature at length, not but after a doubtful and difficult ſtrife, got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſcarcely the better of the Diſeaſe, and then recovered ſtrength by degrees, and health lingringly and ſlowly.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="174" facs="tcp:152521:93"/>If the nature, and formal reaſon of this Epidemical Feaver but now deſcribed, be demanded, we ſay, that this (as that of the former year) properly is an intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Feaver: for what commonly ſpread bore that figure; altho ſome here and there, more rarely, had it continual, which we ſhall by the way mention by and by. The ſeed plot or ſeminary of this, need not be derived from the air, being infected with any Infection, but rather its leading cauſe is to be ſought, from the undue conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the year, and from thence an indiſpoſition of our Blood being acquired. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in the Spring and Autumn, intermitting Feavers have yearly ſprung up and increaſed; to wit, for that our Blood, like to the juice of Vegetables, is wont to be more lively moved than uſual, and to flower at thoſe times. Wherefore if the maſs of Blood, by reaſon of the foregoing ſeaſon, of the Summer, or Winter, ſhould be altered from its due temperature, and ſhould contract either a ſharp or atrabilous diſpoſition, or of any other kind, its evil diſpoſitions begun before, are chiefly ripened about the Equinoxes; to wit, when the Blood more freely fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting (if that it hath departed from its natural diſpoſition) doth not ſo eaſily ſanguifie, but that it will be apt to pervert the alible juice, poured to it, into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous and feaveriſh matter. When therefore this year, had not very much decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from a right conſtitution, (as not only the Dog-days going before but that the two ſolſtices, and the equinoxes, were wholly intemperate, it was no wonder if intermitting Feavers, more frequent than uſual, and thoſe noted with ſome unuſual ſymptoms, did increaſe about the Autumn. That therefore an intermitting Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Feaver raged at this time, I judg it not to be attributed to the fault of the preſent Air, but to the irregularities of the foregoing ſeaſon: yet from what cauſes and occaſions, ſome ſymptoms proper to this Feaver, and diſtinct from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rule of intermitting Feavers, did ariſe, will be worth our Inquiry. I have already ſaid, that the proviſion, that made this Feaver ſo deadly, conſiſted in two things, chiefly, <hi>viz.</hi> the temper of the year, now extremely cold, then upon it very hot, then that it had variouſly perverted the diſpoſition of our Blood, and had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered the pores of the skin, with an undue conſtitution. According to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons taken from either, I ſhall endeavour to explicate the accidents of this Diſeaſe, and to aſſign the cauſes of its appearance.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Firſt, We ſhall obſerve, that the type of this Feaver was various, to wit, in ſome with a continual heat, in others with an eruption of ſpots, but in moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting, and like a Tertian, and ſometimes (tho rarely) a Quotidian, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the fits every day, or every other day: the cauſe of this diverſity, we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to the more ſtrong and potent morbific procatarxy of this year, which produced in the Autumn, a more common intermitting Feaver than it was wont, wherefore, in ſome (perhaps indued with a more praved habit of Body) it ſtirred up Feavers ſomething malignant; and in whom it cauſed intermitting Feavers, according to the wonted manner of the ſeaſon, it made them to be noted with a peculiar appearance of ſymptoms.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Thoſe taken at this time, with the Epidemical Feaver (whether it was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual or intermitting) ſuffered preſently evil Diſtempers of the head, <hi>viz.</hi> now they were wont to be infeſted with cruel head-ach, now with a ſtupor, or too great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction of the Animal Spirits. The reaſon of this is, that the nervous juice, as well as the Blood, by reaſon of the intemperance of the year, was much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from its due Craſis or Diſpoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> by nature ſweet and ſpirituous, and was become now heavy, and almoſt lifeleſs, now ſharp, and too much pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive. Beſides, alſo, the maſs it ſelf of the Blood, very much contributed to this evil; for whilſt it grew hot, the vaporous effluvia, which ought to have been diſperſed outwardly, by reaſon of the Pores being ſhut up, were poured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Brain, and membranes of the head: and by reaſon of this kind of ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, impreſſed almoſt on all, ſweat hardly, and not but partial, and often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, ſucceded in the fits; hence alſo in the height of the Diſeaſe, a perfect Criſis, or ſpontaneous, rarely or never hapned to Cure it; but inſtead of this, if the buſineſs was committed to Nature, the aduſt matter, or recrements ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in the Blood, were transferred to the head, and there raiſed up now the ſleepy evil, now Phrenſies, and thoſe long and ſtubborn.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That the fits ſometimes begun without cold or ſhivering, but with a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome heat, and were prolonged with a difficult ſweat, partial, and often inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:152521:93"/>
then foraſmuch as the ſame being finiſhed, the ſick began again to wax hot, that the fits were not finiſhed without a long evaporation of a dry breath; the cauſe was, the too ſharp and bilous diſpoſition of the Blood, whereby when it grew turgid, it was ſtuffed rather with aduſt Salt and Sulphur, than a ſerous juice, and preſently conceived an inkindling, without any previous Flux of ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous matter; and therefore for want of ſerum, and by reaſon of the Pores being ſhut up, its deflagration was continued for a long time, almoſt only with a dry exhalation, and ſcarce at laſt ended in a remiſſion. And therefore the interſtitia of the fits were moſt troubleſome with heat, and thirſt, Head-ach, Vertigo, and other Diſtempers: becauſe the feaveriſh matter, being heaped up in the Blood, was not all diſperſed by the ſeveral fits, but part of it being left after the fit, as it were extraneous and not miſcible, induced almoſt a continual burning.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It was obſerved, that thoſe diſtempered with this Feaver, preſently loſt their ſtrength and fleſh, that after a fit or two, they panted for breath, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very weak, were not able to ſtand or go, without being led; when it is an uſual thing, in an intermitting Feaver that is common, for the Patient to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lively and cheerful, between the fits: the reaſon of the difference is, becauſe in this Feaver, the maſs of the Blood is both more depraved by the impure mixture of the degenerate juice, and eſpecially, that the ſame is more perverted from its natural diſpoſition, and therefore, when it boyls up leſs out of the fits, it yet ferments not rightly, and equally in the boſom of the heart: wherefore, when by any more quick motion, or agitation of the Body, the Blood is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more impetuouſly into the boſom of the heart, becauſe it is not there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently inkindled, it both leaps forth of doors, and by its ſtagnation, cauſes the oppreſſion of the heart, and great weakning of the Vital Spirits. By reaſon of this kind of dyſcraſie of the Blood, to wit, whereby it is made more unfit for due Fermentation and inkindling in the heart, alſo ſome Beaſts, and eſpecially Horſes, in the Spring time, are made hard breathed, and very unapt to any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid motion.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Laſtly, We are to inquire, concerning this Feaver, wherefore it ſpread chiefly in Villages, in leſſer Towns, and the Country, when Cities and greater Towns were leſs troubled with it. It might ſeem that this Diſtemper, ſhould be excited from marſhie Fogs, and other hurtful Vapours, plentifully heaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in this or that Tract of the Air: but there is a better reaſon, for that the inhabitants of theſe kind of places, being more expoſed to the Spring cold, and then to the Summer heats, might have contracted a greater Dyſcraſie of the Blood, and ſo a more apt diſpoſition to this Feaver. For in truth, the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Country, could ſcarce go out of their houſes, but they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Sun's Beams, or the fervor of the heated Air. Beſides, Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Husbandmen, and ſuch as were accuſtomed to Labours (among whom this Feaver chiefly raged) from their immoderate toyl in the Sun, or open Air, alſo uſing a bad and ſharp Dyet, ſooner acquired an aduſt and torrid diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, and ſo more apt for this Diſeaſe, than Citizens and Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who lived an idle life, and enjoyed wholſome food, and moſtly continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within doors, and in refrigerating ſhades. We may believe this aſſertion, for that not only the Epidemical Feaver now raging, but alſo another of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn before, excited by reaſon of the evil diſpoſition of the Blood, increaſed chiefly among the Countrymen, and inhabitants of the Country: but the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Feaver, which aroſe in the middle of the Spring, depending chiefly upon tranſpiration being hindred, moſtly infeſted Citizens and the Inhabitants of Towns; whilſt ruſtical men, that were wont, by Labour and Exerciſe, to procure a more free breathing forth, remained free.</p>
                        <p>The general Prognoſtication of this Diſeaſe, ſeems only to ominate or foretel, the like evil almoſt to follow this, as followed the Epidemical Feaver of the former Autumn, to wit, (the Augury being taken rather from the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Blood, than from the evil of the Air) not the Peſt, but a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane Feaver might be feared to come upon it. As to the particular Indication, as Signs that promiſe Health or Death, I ſhall briefly mention them; and they chiefly reſpect the temper and government, either of the Blood, with the Vital
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:152521:94"/>
Spirit, or elſe of the nervous juice, with the animal Spirit. If it be plainly indicated from the Pulſe, Urine, from Actions leſs hurt, and the appearance of other ſymptoms, that the Blood, as to its feaveriſh diſpoſition, is not very much perverted, from its natural temper; that in the fits it moderately burns forth; and in every Combat eaſily ſubdues the load of the feaveriſh matter, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhakes it off from its company; that after ſame fits, the maſs of Blood is ſomewhat reſtored towards its due temper; that it perverts little the alible juice, and ſifts forth, with a more gentle riſing up, what is extraneous, and not mingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and that if in the mean time, the other ſpirituous Liquor, rightly inſpires and waters the Brain, and nervous Bodies, that ſleep, waking, ſenſation, and motion, are performed well, or at leaſt indifferently, all good is to be hoped concerning the ſick. But if it appears from the ſame Fountains of Indications, that the Blood hath acquired in this Feaver, a diſpoſition far removed from the natural, if it perverts much of the alible juice, and then from its extraneous and incongruous mixture, the Liquor of the Blood is greatly diſturbed, and the Spirits driven into confuſion; if in the fits, the Blood too ſtrongly, and in a long time burns forth, yet doth not truly ſubdue the feaveriſh matter, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the whole, but that by its impure mixture, it is ſtill more and (in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry feaveriſh fit) more infected, and the Spirits being continually conſumed, it becomes poorer, we may pronounce the life of the patient to be in much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Beſides theſe, if the vices of the nervous juice happen, that being altered from its due temper, or being too dull, and as it were liveleſs, little actuates the Brain and nervous ſtock; or being above meaſure ſharp, continually provokes the ſame into Convulſions and Diſtractions; and if beſides the vaporous efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vias continually falling away from the Blood, or the aduſt recrements being wont to be ſifted forth by a critical ſweat, ſhould be transferred into the head, and there induce Lethargic or Phrenſical Diſtempers, the hopes of health will be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and we may fear a very deadly event.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the Cure of this Diſeaſe, the intentions will come under three conſiderations chiefly. Firſt, a quick reduction (as much as may be) of the Blood, and nervous Liquor, to their natural tempers, or at leaſt a prevention of their too great depravation. Secondly, Concerning the right handling the fits of the fick it ought to be procured, Firſt, that leſs of the degenerate juice, may be gathered together, for matter of the fit; Secondly, that what is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together may be wholly diſperſed by every fit, that thereby the ſick may be better in the intervals; Thirdly, that the Body being altered for the better the fits may be inhibited by anti-feaveriſh Remedies. The third intention re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the ſymptoms chiefly urging, which ſhould be timely oppoſed, whereby Nature, being not hindred, may reduce whatſoever intemperance may be contein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Viſcera or Veſſels, may ſubdue and ſift forth the extraneous matter, and at length may recover a lively force and priſtine vigor.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, therefore, for the reduction and emendation of the Blood and nervous juice, diverſe manners of evacuations are wont to be exhibited in this Diſeaſe, about the beginning of the Sickneſs, with good ſucceſs. It appears plainly from Modern practice, that vomitories are of more noted uſe in this Diſtemper, than in a common Tertian: wherefore in a robuſt Body, and prone to Vomit, about the beginning of the ſecond or third fit, it is convenient to give an Emetic Medicine. The operation of this ſeems to be very helpful in this Feaver, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it more plentifully evacuates the filth from the ventricle, and the yellow bile from the choler-bearing Veſſels; and becauſe it copiouſly preſſes forth the ſerous juice from the emunctories of the nervous ſtock, planted about the Pancreas and Inteſtines, and by provoking them draws it out. Wherefore we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that from a Vomit being taken, the ſick do find themſelves better about the Diſtempers of the Head. A Purge (to whom a Vomit is not convenient) may be ordered inſtead of it, the day following the fit, alſo tho an Emetic have been taken, it may be well permitted after a fit or two: But yet only with gentle and benign Phyſic, let it be performed, which will not diſturb or too much move the Blood. We were wont in theſe Feavers, letting alone Diagri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium or any Aloetic Medicine, only to give an infuſion or Powder of Senna, Rhabarb, and yellow Sanders, with Tartar and Salt of Wormwood; and to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:152521:94"/>
celebrate this kind of Purgation not very long after the beginning of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe: But at other times to keep the Belly ſoluble, with the frequent uſe of Clyſters. Frequent experience has ſufficiently taught, that Letting of Blood is highly profitable in this Diſeaſe: for when by reaſon of the Pores in every one, being more ſtrictly cloſed than uſual, the Blood growing hot, by the Feaver, wanted Ventilation, the Letting of Blood ſupplies the place of a more free breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, and prevents the reſtrained <hi>effluvia,</hi> from ſo readily ſuffuſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the Brain and nervous ſtock. But this Remedy is chiefly indicated from the very fervent Blood, and more hot temperament, nor ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently uſed to old men, Phlegmatic, and other very weak perſons, unleſs perhaps in a ſmall quantity, that the maſs of Blood may be ſomewhat eventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and that the removal of the feaveriſh matter into the Brain, may be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. If it be convenient to open a Vein, let it be done about the beginning of the Feaver, or at leaſt before the fourth or fifth fit, <hi>viz.</hi> before the Blood is made very lifeleſs by the frequent deflagration, and rendred too impure by the confuſion of the aduſt matter: becauſe, if Phlebotomy be made uſe of, whilſt the Blood is highly corrupted, the Vital Spirits, and by that means the ſtrength of the ſick are more debilitated, nor yet is there any thing taken away, from the power of the Diſeaſe, or from its cauſe. There remains another famous way of evacuation, in this Feaver, to wit, Veſicatory Plaiſters applied to various parts of the Body; theſe are commonly obſerved to be ſo helpful, that thoſe that abhor and diſlike very much ſuch a Remedy, by the example of others being the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them, have admitted them. By what means they ſeparate the Cuticula from the skin, and lift it up like a Bladder filled with Water; or whether they preſs forth this watery and limpid humor, out of the Arteries, or out of the nerves, is not in this place to be inquired into; yet that they are profitably ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in this Diſeaſe, beſides experience, Reaſon ſeems ſomething to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade; becauſe it in ſome manner compenſates the want of tranſpiration, by the large profuſion of this kind of ſerous Latex: Moreover, this kind of Remedy, as it were opens the ways and doors, by which both the Blood, and nervous juice, may forthwith ſend forth by a proper purging, the extraneous matter, confuſed with them; wherefore, in the Plague, and Malignant Diſtempers, Veſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories are eſteemed very profitable. Alſo it appears by common obſervation, that in this, and other Feavers, frequent at the ſame time, they did prevent the more grievous Diſtempers of the Head, and were wont to help them, if they were brought in before: wherefore, epiſpatic Plaiſters, may be applied about the beginning of the Diſeaſe, for preſervation ſake, to Phlegmatic perſons, elderly people, and men of a more cold temper; and they are wont profitably to be adminiſtred to ſeveral others, labouring with a Vertigo, Stupefaction, or cruel Head-ach, for the Cure of the ſame Diſtempers. But in conſtitutions very hot, where with the defect of the ſerum, the Blood is too much burnt, and if thoſe ſick of the Feaver are obnoxious to wakings, or a Phrenſie, with intolerable heat, bliſterings ſeem then to be of little uſe.</p>
                        <p>For the mending of the temper of the Blood, and alſo the tenor of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcera, at vacant times, when there is leiſure from purging, attemperating Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies have place, and digeſtives, which fuſe the Liquor of the Blood, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate its faeculencies, and as it were by precipitating them, thruſt them towards the emunctuaries: For theſe ſort of intentions, are wont to be given Juleps, and refrigerating Decoctions, ſharpned with ſpirit of Vitriol, of Salt, Tamarinds, or with the juice of Oranges or Lemons; forms of which choice enough are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to be had. Alſo for this end acetous, ſaline, and ſhelly Powders are uſed, to wit, prepared out of Tartar, Salnitre, the fixed Salt of Herbs, of burnt Harts-horn, alſo the claws and eyes of Crabs. As for example, take of Cream of Tartar drams three, of Salt of Wormwood dram one and an half; the Doſe half a dram, in an opening Decoction, twice in a day out of the fit. Or take of Cream of Tartar dram one, of the Powder of Crabs eyes dram one, of purified Nitre half a dram, mingle them, let them be taken after the ſame manner. Or take of Harts-horn burnt drams two, of the Spirit of Vitriol, what the Powder will drink up, the Doſe is one ſcruple, it is of excellent uſe when thoſe in Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are infeſted with Worms. Theſe kind of Remedies, promote the ſecretion of the feaveriſh matter, and alſo reſtore the almoſt deſtroyed ferments of the Blood, and Viſcera.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="178" facs="tcp:152521:95"/>The ſecond intention, <hi>viz.</hi> concerning the right handling the fits, comprehends more. Firſt, there ought to be inſtituted a right order of Dyet, whereby the more full heaping up of the degenerate juice, for the matter of the fit, may be inhibited; wherefore, they are only to be fed with thin aliments, and they muſt wholly abſtain from fleſh, (or broth made of it) Eggs, ſtrong Drink, and all rich meats and food whatſoever; and be contented only with Barly Broth, or Grewel, Panada, Whey, and ſmall Beer: for that a more plentiful aliment is not digeſted, or aſſimilated, but loads the Ventricle, and being poured into the Blood, diſturbs its Liquor, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels it to grow impetuouſly hot. In the beginning of the fit, and the time of its du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, no food ſhould be taken, unleſs for the allaying of thirſt: But for the temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of heat and thirſt, Juleps, and cooling Decoctions, and eſpecially ſmall Beer, and poſſet Drink ſhould be granted. Secondly, a little before the coming of the fit is expected, a gentle Medicine may be adminiſtred, which may drive away the fit by preventing it, or make it more eaſie by procuring a ſweat: for this uſe, the febrifuge potion of the moſt learned <hi>Riverius</hi> ſerves well, of the Water of Carduus, with oyl of Sulphur, and ſalt of Wormwood: Or take of Cream of Tartar, of ſalt of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and the ſeeds of Nettles, each one ſcruple, let it be given in the Decoction of the Roots of Sorrel; when the Feaver begins to decline, and that the fits are a little more remiſs, proper febrifuges, applied outwardly, often inhibit the comings of the fits. Yet in the mean time, ſo long as the fits of the Feaver return, the ſick are to be handled ſo, that in every fit, the feaveriſh matter heaped in the Blood, may be throughly diſperſed; wherefore, when ſweat hardly ſucceeds, it ſhould be a little excited by temperate Medicines. Alſo the ſick ſhould be kept in bed, with a gentle breathing many hours, nor quickly permitted to riſe; for I have often obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that ſick perſons have been ſtill worſe, becauſe impatient of their bed, they have put on their cloaths before the vaporous effluvia were ſufficiently exhaled.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, as to the ſymptoms, and particular accidents, wherewith the ſick are wont to be infeſted in this Feaver, it is ſufficiently provided for moſt of them, with Remedies, in the method of Cure hitherto deſcribed: again thirſt, the heat of the mouth, the ſcurfineſs of the tongue, vomiting, the looſneſs, fainting, ſwooning, may be referred hither, very well the preſcriptions commonly uſed in other Feavers: but what may ſeem to require in this Diſeaſe a peculiar method of healing, are chiefly the Diſtempers of the head and brain, with the nervous ſtock, which not being time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly helped, may ſoon put the ſick into great danger of life: As to the indications of theſe kind of evils of the head, they are of a twofold kind; if it appears from a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefaction or torpor, a Sleepineſs, Vertigo, or Head-ach, that the nervous juice is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come too dull, and as it were vapid or lifeleſs, and therefore doth not ſufficiently actuate the brain, and nervous bodies; beſides the Remedies already delivered, and eſpecially veſicatories, Medicines full of a volatile ſalt do chiefly help: wherefore, ſpirits of Harts-horn, and of Blood, alſo the ſalts of them, are of excellent uſe: but if the nervous Liquor be too ſharp, or the effluvia ſuffuſed from the eſtuating Blood, drive the Animal Spirits into confuſions or diſtractions, Remedies of the ſame ſort of volatile ſalt are adminiſtred with ſucceſs in a little ſmaller quantity. Beſides, a frequent letting of Blood, and aſſwaging Medicines, againſt its Fervor, help much; as Emulſions, Whey, and ſimple Water, plentifully drunk; Opiats are cautiouſly to be given in this Feaver, for the Phrenſie being often allayed by them, is changed into a Lethargie, or a deep ſtupefaction.</p>

                        <p>THE Inſpection of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines, and from them an inveſtigation of directions concerning the Medicinal practice, began to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the Ancients, even from the firſt beginning of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine: for from hence for the making of judgments concerning the Sick, and for the chuſing the moſt fit times for Curing, the great <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath chiefly taken both his praenotions, and his precepts, ſo that that famous and to this day approved ſtatute of old Medicine, to wit, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, to compoſe Medicine according to digeſtions, cannot be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without rightly conſulting the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinal. Alſo this ſeems conſonant to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon, that for as much as we cannot ſearch into the moſt intimate parts of the ſick Body, as it were a Veſſel ſhut up, judgment is ſought from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed liquor, waſhing all its parts, and taking from many ſome little parcels. For neither more certainly do the acidulous or Spaw-waters, ſhew the nature of the hidden Mine, through which they are ſtrained, than <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the divers manners of dyſcraſies of our Bodies, and their habitudes. Wherefore the Contemplation of this Excrement, (as vile as it is) hath grown to a Science, and hath exerciſed the ingenuities of the moſt excellent Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, both Ancient and Modern. Concerning this thing there are many Books extant, writ with great diligence; in which are rehearſed the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines, varieties of Colours, and diverſities of Conſiſtence, and their Contents exactly deſcribed, and diſtinct precepts are delivered for every excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them: Which indeed are eſteemed by ſome of ſo great certitude, that from the inſpection of the water, a ſignification is ſought of any Diſeaſe, or of the part affected; yea of every accident concerning the ſick. But in this the common people are egregiouſly deceived, and ſtill pertinaciouſly will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, whilſt they imagine the knowledg of every Diſeaſe, and the prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it cannot be found out, but by inſpecting the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine; and eſteem a Phyſician of little worth unleſs he undertakes to divine from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinal as from a Magical Glaſs. But indeed, as to what belongs to the precepts, and rules, whereon the reaſon of Judgment by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine doth depend, there are many col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by diligent obſervation, that are extant, and from thence eſtabliſh'd with good reaſon and judgment: yet for as much as the ſignification of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines is by ſome too largely extended to particular Caſes, very many uncertain things interwoven, and ſome obnoxious to deceit, and others plainly falſe; therefore who ſhall confidently pronounce concerning the buſineſs of the Sick, by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only of the Water, deſerves rather the name of a jugling Quack, than of a Phyſician.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:152521:97"/>But this Doctrine concerning <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines, abounds ſo ordinarily with errors, that the obſervations which belong to its practice, are either wrongfully made, or not well reduced into method. We may lawfully ſuſpect that the obſervations are not rightly made, becauſe, perhaps from one or two particular caſes, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a general Rule is eſtabliſhed. For Example ſake, becauſe ſome Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical people render a thin and watry <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, therefore it is affirmed, ſuch ſort of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines neceſſarily denote a Dropſie, when alſo in ſome other diſeaſes, ſuch like <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines are made; and ſometimes in the Dropſie, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine are thick, and full of redneſs. Alſo as it is moſt commonly received, that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines on which a cream doth ſwim (as on water that hath Tartar boyled in it) doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note a Conſumption, which is moſt uncertain, becauſe this ſign is more proper and familiar to Hypochondriacks, than to Conſumptive people: And how many dye of Conſumptions without this? Beſides, what is generally aſſerted, to wit, that in all diſeaſes whatſoever, Nature doth make known the Diſeaſe by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, is altogether falſe; becauſe ſometimes ſick people make their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine like healthful people; and ſometimes thoſe who are very well in health, by reaſon of ſome accident (perhaps from the meats eaten) have ſuſpected <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, varying from the natural ſtate or condition. As to what belongs to the method, or doctrine delivered by most, concerning <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines, they ſeem to be altogether Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirical, and nothing rational: for the naked differences of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines are rehearſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and are wont to be diſtinguiſhed according to their colour, conſistency, and contents: thence are oppoſed to the ſeveral ſpecies of theſe pathologick ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, collected only from more rare obſervations; when in the mean time, the cauſes of the appearances, nor of the preternatural alterations in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines, are not aſſigned, as they ought to be; nor is the ſignification of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Cauſes of diſeaſes, but only to the Diſeaſe or Symptom; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is moſt often deceitful, and uncertain; becauſe the ſame morbifick Cauſe, and ſignification of the ſame <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, may in like manner mediately reſpect at once divers Diſeaſes, and Symptoms. As for Example, a thin and watry <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine moſt often immediately denotes Indigeſtion, or a defect of Concoction in the Viſcera: nevertheleſs, by reaſon of that condition of Crudity, the Green-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Virgins, ſometimes the Dropſie, or the white watery phlegmacy, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Head-aches, and many other diſeaſes ariſe. But the task which you have required of me, Worthy Sir, to wit, That the notions which in times paſt we have diſcourſed together, and conceived concerning <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines, as it were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected notes, and what have ſince fallen under my own knowledg, by my proper ſtudy and obſervation, concerning this thing, ſhould be fram'd into a little Treatiſe, and that I ſhould write a plain, and new method of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinoſcopie. I confeſs the work greater than can well be performed by our own proper ſtrength: however, I have reſolved as much as I am able, to obey you therein. But that a doctrine or method concerning <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rines may be inſtituted, beyond the vulgar and plainly Empirical manner of Philoſophiſing, there ſhall be theſe two heads of our Diſcourſe. To wit, Firſt that the Anatomy of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine may be delivered, of what elements and parts it conſiſts; and alſo its geneſis in our Body; to wit, by what Concoction this kind of Liquor is made, and then by what ſecretion of ſome Particles from others. Secondly, That the inſpection of urines in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinal may be truly unfolded, and what may be the Rules, and the Certitude of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>romancie, or divination of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Elements and chief Accidents of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</head>
                           <p>WHEN the Liquor of the Urine, being either freſh rendred from the body, or putrified by a long digeſtion, is expoſed to a ſpagirick Analyſis, it is wont to be reſolved into theſe parts or principles: In the Diſtilling, firſt, aſcends whatever of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſpirit is in it, diluted with water; but yet in fo very ſmall quantity, that it is not eaſily to be perceived by the taſte it ſelf. To this follows a watry liquor, large enough in proportion, with which are mixed ſome more looſe particles of Salt, and Sulphur eſpecially. Thirdly, There is ſtilled forth a very penetrative water; which is commonly called the ſpirit of Urine, but in truth almoſt without any vinous ſpirit, and is chiefly phlegm highly ſharpned with Salt, and therefore it aſcends laſt, as in the diſtillation of Vinegar: but foraſmuch as the ſalt of Urine is volatile, but that of Vinegar only in the Flux; therefore the liquor ſtilled forth, which is greatly impregnated with its particles, is very acid: That which is imbued with the ſaline Particles of the other, is exceeding ſharp and pricking. It is a ſign that this kind of Spirit of Urine (as it is commonly known) ows its ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs chiefly to the Salt; becauſe, though it be moſt ſubtil it will not take fire, but being put to it extinguiſhes it. After the humidity is wholly exhal'd, another porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Salt remains with the earth, in the bottom of the cucurbit; to which if a more hot fire be made, that Salt will be ſublimed into the Alembick, and the earthy feces only remain. This kind of Anatomy of Urine plainly ſhows, that the Elements of which its liquor is compoſed, are a great deal of Water and Salt, and a little of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur and Earth, and a very little of Spirit.</p>
                           <p>The ſaltneſs in Urines is perceived by the taſte and touch; it comes neareſt to a Nitrous ſalt in ſavour: It is drawn indeed from ſaline particles of things eaten, which being more plentifully exalted by the concoction in the Bowels, and the circulation in the Veſſels, for the moſt part go into a volatile Salt. That is truly Salt and Spirit, by reaſon of the long accompanying of either together, are gathered into a moſt ſtrict bond; and therefore it happens, that the Salt it ſelf otherways fixed, is carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up on high, and rendred able for motion, as it were by the wings of the other. Urines contain in them more or leſs of Salt, according to the diſpoſition of our body, and have it either more volatile or fixed; which are therefore of a divers colour and conſiſtency.</p>
                           <p>That there is Sulphur contained in Urines, their quickly putrifying, and ſtink, ſufficiently teſtifie: it ariſes from the fat and ſulphureous particles of Meats, in the concoction being moſt minutely broken, and boyl'd with the ſerum and ſalt; ſo as alſo there is leſs plenty of Spirit in it, than is in Blood, Soot, or the Horns of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals: wherefore in the diſtillation of Urine, there aſcends nothing almoſt of an oylie form or fat. But indeed, whilſt the blood is circulated in the Veſſels, the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and ſulphureous little bodies, which fall away from it, do for the moſt part evaporate out of dores; in the mean time, the ſaline recrements, and the watery, chiefly conſtitute the Piſs: nevertheleſs, Urines do always participate a little of ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, but its quantity and proportion, is diverſly altered according to the various degrees of Concoction and Crudity; and thence alſo the colour and conſiſtence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive many mutations in Urines.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="2" facs="tcp:152521:98"/>That there is but a very little of vinous ſpirit in Urines, the defect of it in the liquor firſt diſtilled forth, alſo the ſoon putrifying of the Stale do teſtifie: but that there is ſome, the inteſtine motion of the particles in the Urine, doth argue, to wit, the departure of the thin from the thick, and the ſpontaneous ſeparation of ſome parts from others, and a collection of them into a ſettlement: beſides, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line particles (for that they are made volatile) are married to ſpirituals, and ſo they are of a more ready motion, and energy; yet according to the divers plenty of ſpirits in Urines, and their power, there ariſe divers manners of hypoſtaſes and ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; alſo the Urines themſelves, ſooner or ſlower putrifie.</p>
                           <p>The watry part of the Urine far exceeds the reſt in quantity, and is greater than they by almoſt a ſixth part: it is not ſo ſimply drawn forth by diſtillation, but that ſome particles of Salt and Sulphur (for as much as they are volatile) aſcend with it, and impart to the water an ingrateful ſtink: the potulent matter, copiouſly taken with aliments, affords an original to this; which of what kind ſoever it be, before it is changed into Urine, lays aſide its proper qualities, and acquires others; for tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the aſſumed liquor, there is nothing ſincere almoſt left in the Piſs, beſides meer humidity.</p>
                           <p>That there is earth, and muddy feces to be had in Urines, its diſtillation, or eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration ſufficiently declares: for when the reſt of the parts are exhaled, the earth as it were a <hi>caput mortuum,</hi> will remain in a moderate quantity in the bottom: Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as in the nouriſhing juice, there is required ſomething ſolid beſides the active principles of ſalt, ſulphur, and ſpirit, whence the bulk and magnitude of the body grows; the recrements of this, <hi>viz.</hi> the earthy feculencies, are plentifully diſſolved in the ſerum, and contribute to it a thick conſiſtence and contents: but theſe ſhew themſelves after a divers manner, according to the ſtate of Concoction and Crudity.</p>
                           <p>Theſe are the principles which conſtitute the body of the Urine, alſo into which it is eaſily reſolved, by a Chymical Analyſis: Out of the divers changes, and various contemperation of theſe, the other accidents of Urine ariſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Quantity, Colour, Conſiſtency, and Contents, which are as to the ſenſe the moſt notable concerning it, and the chief objects of the rendred Urine: For when there is nothing almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held beſides in the Piſs, they conſtitute theſe firſt Phaenomena, in which rightly ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, conſiſts the whole Hypotheſis of this Science: Wherefore we ſhall ſpeak in the next place concerning theſe, and firſt of the Urine of healthful people, what its quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity may be, how coloured, with what conſiſtence and contents indued; and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall be unfolded, out of what mixture of Elements, and by what Concoction in the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and Veſſels, each of theſe depend. Secondly, ſhall be ſhown how many ways the Urines of Sick people vary from the ſquare or Rule of this of the Sound: and I ſhall endeavour to aſſign, for the ſeveral differences of them, proper Cauſes of their alterations; and theſe ſhall conclude our firſt propoſition in this Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Anatomy of Urine.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Quantity and Colour of the Urines of Sound People.</head>
                           <p>THE Quantity of the Urine in ſound people ought to be a little leſs than the humor, or liquid ſubſtance daily taken; for moiſt and drinkable things dayly taken, are the matter it ſelf of which Urines are firſt made: But theſe (hunger and thirſt urging) are more plentifully required, both that they may ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently waſh the maſs of the Chyme, by which means it may rightly ferment in the Viſcera; and that they may ſerve for a Vehicle, both to the Chyme, whereby it may be conveyed to the bloody Maſs, and to the Blood it ſelf, that it might be circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the Veſſels without thickening; and to the Nervous Juice, whereby it might actuate and water the Organs of ſenſe and motion: when the ſerous Latex by this means hath beſtowed whatever it hath almoſt of Spirit and Sulphur, for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Heat, and Motion, it gives way to a new nutritious humour; and it ſelf as unprofitable, being ſecluded from the Blood, by the help of the Reins is ſent away.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152521:98"/>
The nouriſhing liquor, which will at laſt be changed into Urine, of its own nature is divers, <hi>viz.</hi> now watry, now impregnated with Spirit, now with Salt and Sulphur, and according to the various forces of this or that Element in it Urines are wont to be ſomewhat altered: However all liquors taken in at the mouth, do not paſs thorow our body whole and untouched; but that they undergo mutations in various parts, and loſe a little portion of their quantity, before they are made into Urine: For the Latex or Humour to be converted into Urine, is firſt of all received into the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, (for I aſſent not to <hi>Reuſner,</hi> who affirms the ſame falling for the moſt part on the Lungs, to cauſe the more quick making water after drinking) whilſt that it ſtays in the Ventricle, it is there boyled; alſo impregnated with Salt and Sulphur of its own, or from more ſolid Aliments diſſolved: then very much of it is confuſed in the blood, with the nouriſhable juice; which, when it is a long time Circulated, from thence receives a farther tincture of Salt and Sulphur, according to the various temper of the Blood, and its inkindling in the Heart: Hence ſome portion of it is derived with the Animal Spirit, to the Brain and nervous ſtock; and afterwards from thence, being made lifeleſs and weak, is laſtly reduced into the boſom of the Blood; after that it hath beſtowed on the Blood and Nervous Juice, whatever of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous or noble is conteined in the Serum, alſo no ſmall quantity is conſumed by ſweat and the other emunctories; what remains, whilſt that the Blood continually waſhes the Reins, a precipitation being made, either by a ſtraining or force of a certain ferment, it is there ſeparated from the Blood, and from thence paſſes thorow the Ureters into the Bladder, and ſo is carryed forth of doors.</p>
                           <p>From the origine and luſtration of the Serous Latex, but now deſcribed, it plainly appears, that the Urine ought to anſwer to the quantity of the liquids taken, in ſomewhat a leſſer proportion, perhaps under a third part; which plainly ſhews the diſpoſition and ſtrength of the Viſcera ſerving for Concoction, as alſo the temper and diſtribution of the Blood it ſelf, and after a ſort of the nervous juice; moreover it carries with it ſigns of the affections of the Urinary paſſages. The quantity of the Urine declines often from this Rule, ſo that ſometimes it ſuperabounds, alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is deficient: and either for a ſhort time, may conſiſt with a diſpoſition not much unhealthful; but if theſe kind of diſtempers continue long, they argue a ſickly condition. Concerning theſe we ſhall ſpeak among the appearances of the Urine in a diſeaſed condition of the Body; we ſhall now next conſider the colour of a ſound Urine.</p>
                           <p>The Urine of Sound People, which is rendred after Concoction is finiſhed in the Body, is of a Citron colour, like Lye a little boyled: which without doubt proceeds from the Salt and Sulphur of the nutritious juice, and the Blood, diſſolved in the Concoction, and boyled in the Serum. This colour doth not ariſe only from Salt (as ſome would have it) becauſe the Liquor impregnated with Salt, unleſs it be evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a certain thickneſs, will not grow yellowiſh: Alſo Salt of Tartar, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by melting, continues ſtill clear. What may be objected concerning the Lye of Aſhes, I ſay, there the whole Sulphur is not conſumed by burning, but the Citron colour ariſes from ſome ſaline Particles, and others Sulphureous burnt, and ſticking together in the Aſhes, and then infuſed or boyled in the liquor. Neither doth the Urine of ſound people acquire this ſame colour from Sulphur only, becauſe Sulphur in a watry Menſtruum, is not diſſolved unleſs by the addition of Salt, nor will it give any tincture of it ſelf; but if Salt of Tartar and common Sulphur be digeſted together in water, or if Antimony be boyled in a ſaline Menſtruum, both liquors will by that means grow yellow like Urine; after the like manner, the ſaline and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Particles of Aliments, being incocted and moſt minutely broken in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, by a Digeſtion in the Ventricle and Inteſtines, and by a Circulation with the Blood in the Arteries and Veins, impart to it a Citron Colour.</p>
                           <p>This kind of diſſolution of Salt and Sulphur, by whoſe means the Urines are made of a Citron Colour, is firſt begun in the Bowels; and afterwards perfected in the Veſſels, and very much depends upon the Concoction performed in the Ventricle and the Inteſtines: For here, by the help of heat and of ferments, the Aliments taken are chiefly ſubdued; the bond of mixture being broken, the ſaline and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Particles being moſt ſmally broken, and made ſmall, go into a milkie Cream, and from thence the Serum remaining after that Concoction and diſtribution of that milkie juice, becomes of a Citron colour: after the ſame manner, as when the Salt of Tartar and common Sulphur being diſſolved together, and mixed with ſome acid
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152521:99"/>
thing, indue a milkie colour; then the contents being ſeparated by ſetling, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining liquor grows yellow like Lye. If that the aliments, by reaſon of an evil diſpoſition of the Ventricle, are not rightly digeſted in the firſt Concoction, as in the Longing Diſeaſe or Pica, the Dropſie, and other ill diſpoſitions of the Bowels, uſually comes to paſs, the Urine alſo is rendred crude, clear, and almoſt inſipid, like Fountain water; but if by reaſon of the ferments of the Viſcera being more than duly exalted, or otherways depraved as in the Scurvy, Hypochondriac diſtemper, or Feavouriſh intemperance, the particles of things eaten are too much diſſolved in the firſt Region, by that means Urines are rendred red, and thick.</p>
                           <p>The Serum, as hath but now been ſaid, being imbued with a lixivial tincture in the firſt Concoction, and confuſed in the Blood, ſo long as it is circulated with it, it is yet further Concocted, and acquires a more deep colour; for the particles of the Blood being roaſted and ſcorched, although for the moſt part they are laid aſide into the Gall bag, yet being in a manner boyled in the Serous Latex, they heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten its colour; hence the Concoction being ended, the Urine which is firſt made, is more Pale, and that which is laſt, more Red. That which is made after long faſting, is yet more high Coloured. Where the Blood is more cold, as in Cachectical people, the colour of the Urine is made leſs; where the Blood grows raging with a feavouriſh Heat, and is roaſted, the Urine grows highly Red.</p>
                           <p>Concerning the Urines of ſound people, it is worth obſervation, that which is made after plentiful Drinking, hath no tincture, but is pale like water; of which we ſhall enquire, by what means the Serous Latex ſo ſuddenly ſlides away out of the Ventricle, (contrary to what is vulgarly believed) and paſſing thorow all the Chyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous paſſages, then the Veins, Arteries, the boſom of the Heart it ſelf, and the turnings and windings of the Veins, and Ureters, is put forth of the Body within ſo ſhort a ſpace: moreover, how it comes that the Urine being ſo precipitately made, contrary to moſt other things, is not only changed into no Colour in its paſſage, but it alſo loſes its own proper: For as the Proverb is, <hi>Our Drink goes thick in, and comes forth thin:</hi> or <hi>We Drink thick Beer, and Piſs clear.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Concerning this we ſay, that beſides the long wandring of the nouriſhing juice, to wit, whereby, after ſome ſtay in the Ventricle, it ſlides into the Inteſtines, and from thence thorow the milkie Veſſels into new paſſages, and thence is carried into the Veins, (which carrying about cannot be quickly performed) it is moſt likely, that there is another nearer paſſage of the ſame Nutritious Juce, whereby indeed it may be conveyed immediately and without delay to the Maſs of Blood, and perhaps to the nervous Liquor; and therefore, after faſting there immediately follows a moſt quick refection of ſtrength and ſpirits, after Eating, and eſpecially after Drinking; which indeed cannot be thought to be made by the Spirits and Vapours; alſo from ſuch drinking, the Urine is preſently rendred, and indeed ſooner than it can be thought, that the Maſs of the Chyle can be ſent out of the boſom of the Ventricle; wherefore, it is not improbable, that when the Alimentous Liquor is entred the Ventricle, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the more thin portion of it, which conſiſts chiefly of Spirit and Water, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed by its Spongeous Membranes; and from thence being inſtilled into the little mouths of the Veins, it is preſently confounded with the Blood, flowing back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Heart. For of this opinion (though not very ſtubbornly) I always was, <hi>That the Chyme was in ſome meaſure immediately derived from the Ventricle, and Inteſtines, by the branches of the Vena Porta, into the Maſs of Blood;</hi> and as the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie paſſages carry it about by a long compaſs, whereby it may be inſtilled into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending Trunk of the <hi>Vena cava;</hi> ſo that it may be carried in a more near way, <hi>viz.</hi> into the aſcending Trunk of the ſame, by theſe Veſſels; foraſmuch as the Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made poorer in its Circulation, returning from either part, before it had entred the Heart, it ought to be refreſhed with a new juice, whereby it might more lively ferment in the boſom of the Heart; but foraſmuch as the much greater part of the Blood is carryed upwards, ſurely it may ſeem agreeable to truth, that at leaſt ſome portion of the nouriſhing Juice may be added to this, as it were a ſuſtenance, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before burnt forth, and almoſt lifeleſs, for its new inkindling in the Heart. The Arguments that ſeem to perſwade to this, not of light moment, I could here heap together, but I ſhould ſo divert far from our propoſition: wherefore, that we ſo ſuddenly make a wateriſh Urine after Drinking, I eſteem to be done after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as was but now ſaid; therefore the Liquor that is carryed ſo haſtily from the Aliments to the Maſs of Blood, paſſing thorow the ſo narrow windings (as are the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152521:99"/>
Membranes of the Viſcera) being drawn as it were by diſtillation, the more thick matter being rejected, conſiſts almoſt only of Water and Spirit; with which indeed it refreſhes the vital Spirits, and dilutes the Blood; about which task, when the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous part is conſumed, the watry Latex, becauſe of its plenty, being heavy and troubleſome, is continually ſent away by the Reins; and when it comes from the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, not yet imbued with Salt and Sulphur, nor is long circulated with the Blood, that it might by that means acquire a lixivial tincture, it is rendred thin, and clear.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Conſiſtence and Contents of the Urine of Sound People.</head>
                           <p>SO much for the Quantity and colour of Urines, which proceed from a ſound Body; but as to what belongs to the Contents, we muſt know, that there ought to be nothing beſides the Hypoſtaſis in a ſound Urine; but what this is, and by what means it ſinks down, remains to be unfolded in the next place.</p>
                           <p>So long as the Maſs of Blood, being fuſed with the ſerous and nouriſhable humour, is continually Circulated in the Veſſels, from it a certain nutritious juice is made, by a perpetual digeſtion, which being put continually to the ſolid parts, goes into nouriſhment: This firſt of all is digeſted into a glutinous humour, like the white of an Egg, afterwards into thin Filaments or Rags, which being interwoven in the Pores and little ſpaces of the ſolid parts, ſtill afford to them an increaſe of new ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; but whilſt the Serum being mixed with the Blood, waſhes all the Regions of the Body, it ſucks up into it ſelf a certain ſuperfluous portion of this laſt Aliment, to be lay'd on the ſolid parts, and carries it forth of dores with it ſelf; and this it is that conſtitutes the Hypoſtaſis or ſettlement in Urines; wherefore ſo long as this is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it indicates how far Concoction and Nutrition in ſome meaſure is performed, and is accounted a laudable ſign; its abſence ſhews Crudity and Cachectical people, or a Dyſcraſie in Feavours; it conſiſting of ſmall Threads or Filaments, is diſperſed at firſt thorow the whole body of the Urine, and then is collected into a little Cloud, by this means. Theſe Filaments or Threads, are long, and ſmooth, alſo indued with ſome ſharpneſſes like Brier-pricks, that from thence being ſhaken about, they eaſily lay hold of one another, and are faſtned together; even as if into an Urinal full of water, you ſhould caſt many Hairs, and then by ſhaking about the Veſſel, the hairs at firſt ſwimming diſperſedly, in a little time would lay hold on one another, and be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected into a little bundle; after the ſame manner (as it ſeems) the little threads which conſtitute the Hypoſtaſis or ſettlement being variouſly here and there agitated by the colour and ſpirits implanted in the Urine, intangle and thruſt upon one another, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they gather into one little Cloud by the mutual knitting of all together; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Filaments are compacted, and more ſolid than the other Contents of the Urine, they ſink towards the bottom with their weight.</p>
                           <p>It is very likely, that theſe kind of Filaments, make the Hypoſtaſis in the Urines of Sound people, for that the Blood being well conſtituted, and diſpoſed to nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is very much ſtuffed with Fibres, or white Filaments: becauſe, when a Vein is opened, if the Blood let out be received into warm water, it will be conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous to any one; for the red thick ſubſtance being diluted with the liquor, theſe ſmooth and white threads ſwim in the water; wherefore it ſeems, that ſome of theſe thin or ſlender rags, being ſnatch'd away with the ſerous juce, are the matter of this cloud ſubſiding in the Urine; wherefore in Cachectical people, by reaſon of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, the Blood being very wateriſh, and unfit for nouriſhment, is deſtitute of theſe well labour'd Fibrils; alſo in Dyſcraſies, when the nutritious humour, the Blood being too much ſcorched, is not rightly concocted into theſe kind of Filaments, the Hypoſtaſis in Urines is either wholly wanting, or is very confuſed and diſturbed.</p>
                           <p>It is ſaid to be a good and laudable Hypoſtaſis, which is of a whitiſh colour, of a round and equal figure, and ſinks towards the bottom, to which are required, Firſt, that that laſt Aliment be rightly labour'd, whereby the Filaments may become white, ſmooth, and ſolid, like to ſlender Fibres. Secondly, that the Urine be ſufficiently ſtrong in ſpirits, which (as is beheld in the growing hot of Muſt, or new Wine)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152521:100"/>
may agitate, and compel here and there all parts. Thirdly, that the liquor be not too thick, nor that its Pores be firſt poſſeſſed by ſtrange bodies, whereby the motion of the contents may be hindred, but that a ſufficient ſpace may be left, for the free agitating and toſſing about theſe kind of Particles.</p>
                           <p>If the ſubſtance be red, it is a ſign that that laſt Aliment is ſcorched and burnt, with too much heat; wherefore ſuch a ſediment, for the moſt part is in the beginning of a Feavour, ſo long as the Coction in the Viſcera and Veſſels, is not wholly perverted; if the Hypoſtaſis be broken and unequal, it is a ſign that the nutriment deſtinated for the ſolid parts, is not rightly and equally concocted, and that its Particles are not homogene, and alike in every part: wherefore the Filaments do not cohere together, but theſe with thoſe, and they with others, are entangled apart; hence ſome more thick deſcend towards the bottom, and others more light ſwim upon the top. When the Hypoſtaſis does not wholly ſink down, but hangs all of it, either in the middle or upper Region, that happens, becauſe that thoſe Filaments are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly laboured, nor ſolid and compact, but more rare and ſpungy, or becauſe the liquor is thicker, and more impregnate with Salt and Sulphur, and therefore like Lie it ſuſtains ſome weights, which otherwiſe would ſink to the bottom. Sometimes the Hypoſtaſis is wholly wanting, in ſound people, after long faſting, immoderate labours, or copious ſweating, the matter being wholly conſumed into nutriment, or evaporated by ſweat; in Feavours, by reaſon of the very depraved condition of the Blood; alſo in the Pica, Cachexie, and other Diſtempers of that kind, by reaſon of the great Crudity.</p>
                           <p>Concerning the conſiſtency of the Urine in ſound people, there is not much wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy conſideration to be met with: It is wont to be of that ſort, as midling Beer is, being purified by a long Fermentation; or Lye a little boyled, <hi>viz.</hi> the watry liquor of the Urine, ought to include in its Pores and paſſages, a great many Particles of Salt, and Sulphur, moſt ſmally broken, and diſſolved; and beſides a little of earth, divided very exceeding ſmall, and diſperſed thorow the whole body of the Piſs; if the conſiſtence be thinner than it ought, as it is in clear, or limpid Urines, and watry, it is a ſign of indigeſtion and crudity; that the Aliments are not fully overcome, and Concocted; but if the Urine be thicker, and cloſer than it ought, it is a ſign, that the body of the liquor, is filled with preternatural Contents. But of theſe elſewhere, when we ſhall ſpeak of the Urines of the Sick.</p>
                           <p>Thus far of Urine, foraſmuch as it is an Excrement, and ſign of Concoction in a ſound body (truly performed in the Viſcera and in the Veſſels) the quantity or bulk of which is to be determined by the potulent matter; the colour Citron, from the diſſolved Salt and Sulphur, and boyled in the Serum; the Hypoſtaſis or Contents depend upon the Filaments, elaboured in the Blood, for the nouriſhment of the ſolid parts; the conſiſtency on the Salt and Sulphur, together with the Particles of Earth, filling the Pores and paſſages of the ſerous liquor. It next remains, that we treat of the Urines of ſick people: in which alſo, the Quantity, Colour, Contents, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, and ſome accidents beſides, offer themſelves to conſideration.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Quantity and Colour in Urines of ſick People.</head>
                           <p>IN a Morbous proviſion of Bodies, or Sickly eſtate, the quantity of the Urine does not exactly quadrate with the proportion of the liquid things taken; for ſometimes it wants of its due meaſure, and ſometimes exceeds it. When the Urine is much leſs than the drinkable things taken, the reaſon is, becauſe the watry Latex either ſtays ſomewhere in the Body, or is diverted by ſome other way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, than by Urine: if it remains within; Firſt, it is either heaped up about the Viſcera, and their Cavities, and ſo is ſtay'd now in the Ventricle, more than it ought to do, and induces by the diſtention of it, troubles, with ſpitting; but more often, it is laid up in the hollowneſs of the Abdomen, and ſometimes of the Thorax and head, and there is wont to cauſe Hydropic Diſeaſes. Or, Secondly, the Serum ſtagnates in the Veſſels, and ſo increaſes the bulk of the Blood, and Nervous Liquor,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152521:100"/>
and notably perverts its motion; whence Catarrhs, Rheumatick diſtempers, and often Palſies and Convulſions are cauſed. Or thirdly, this watry humour is fixed in the habit of the body, and ſo creates a ſwelling up of the whole body, or of ſome parts. Or fourthly and laſtly, it is obſtructed in the urinary paſſages, by the Stone, or thick matter, as it were a dam oppoſing it; and cauſes in thoſe parts pains and Convulſions, and a fulneſs of the Serum in the whole body. When the ſerous water is other ways beſtowed, the Patients are for the moſt part prone to frequent and troubleſom Sweats, or almoſt to a continual Looſneſs.</p>
                           <p>The diſtempers therefore which the ſmall quantity of the Urine is wont to indicate, are ſometimes the ſwelling up of ſome of the Viſcera, and a heaping up of water in them, ſometimes Catarrhal diſtempers, ſometimes evil diſpoſitions of the nervous ſtock: ſometimes an Anaſarca and watry Tumors; and ſometimes the ſtony diſpoſition of the Reins and Bladder. And ſometimes alſo the diminution of the <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> is the effect and ſign of ſome other preternatural evacution, <hi>viz.</hi> an immoderate excretion of Sweat, Lask, or ſome other thing. To deſcribe here exactly all the ſubſiſtences of the ſerous Latex, either in the body, or the cauſes of it other ways excreted, and the manner of doing it, were to transfer hither almoſt the whole matter of Pathology; for many and divers are the occaſions and circumſtances, whereupon this Serum is heaped up in this or that part, and ſubſiſting in the body, diminiſhes the quantity of the Urine; but for the moſt part the principal and moſt frequent cauſe of this conſiſts not ſo much in the fault of the Liver, Spleen, or Reins, as of the blood it ſelf: to wit, a copious and free making of Urine, as alſo its ſtay in the body, and only made in little quantity, depend chiefly on the temper of the blood, and either on its kindling, or fermentation in the heart: for if the blood be ſtrong in rightly exalted principles, (<hi>viz.</hi> Spirit, Sulphur, and Salt) it grows very hot in the Veſſels, and ſo the frame of the liquor being looſe enough, it is duly kindled by the ferment of the heart; and almoſt ſpiritualizes the whole, paſſes through all parts with heat and a rapid motion, without ſtopping, and whatſoever is ſuperfluous and volatile, evaporates out of doors: and whilſt the blood is ratified, and boiling with heat, paſſes through the Reins, what is ſerous is eaſily ſeparated, either by the ſtrainer of the Reins only, or (which is moſt likely) by a coagulation, and is as it were precipitated from the remaining maſs of the blood. The ſame thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt happens after this manner to the blood, as we may obſerve in Milk, <hi>viz.</hi> whilſt it is warmed, and grows hot, it moſt eaſily goes into parts, and its Serum is moſt eaſily ſeparated by the leaſt drop of Runnet, or Coagulum put into it: but if you pour much more ſtrong and ſour ferment into it, when it is cold, a precipitation will hardly follow; ſo if the blood becomes through an evil conſtitution, or ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living, more cool and watry, that being leſs endued with active Elements, it grows but dully hot, and is but little kindled in the heart; it is circulated very ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and difficultly in the Veſſels; paſſing through the Pores and paſſages of the Viſcera, it cleaves a little to them, and leaves ſomething behind it; whence are begotten every where Obſtructions and Tumors; alſo the blood by this means becoming viſcous and cool, and ſo unfit for precipitation or percolation, lays aſide leſs readily its excrements in the Reins; but leaves them every where in the body, becauſe it hardly, and not without the reſidence of a certain humor, is circulated. Wherefore in this ſtate, thoſe things that move the blood very much, as exerciſe and a more quick motion; or alſo ſuch as may fuſe it, as it were with a Coagulum or Runnet, as are ſharp things, and preparations of Salts, will more freely provoke Urine.</p>
                           <p>It ſometimes happens, that the Urines of the ſick are made in a large quantity, and very profuſe, that in a day and a nights ſpace, they make perhaps twice or thrice as much water, as the Liquids they have taken; the cauſes of which diſtemper are alſo various, and the ſignifications very divers; if after the ſuppreſſion of Urine, or its quantity formerly leſſened, if in Hydropick diſtempers, Rheumatiſms, or paſſions of the nervous ſtock, or in the Criſes of Feavers, a flowing down of the Urine follows, either of its own accord, or by the uſe of Diureticks, it denotes a Cure of the diſeaſe, or preternatural diſpoſition, or at leaſt a declining of it. But if (as I have often obſerved) in a lean and weak conſtitution (without any of the previous diſtempers but now recited) the Urine exceeds much the Liquids taken, and from thence a great debility of the whole follows; this indeed ſignifies an evil diſpoſition, with a tendency to a waſting or Conſumption. I have known ſome women of a tender and moſt fine make, who ſometimes being ill, for many days,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152521:101"/>
were wont daily to make water in a great abundance, (exceeding twice the Liquids taken) and that watry and thin, without contents or ſettlement; at which time they have complained of a languiſhing of ſtrength, difficult reſpiration, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency to motion. I ſuppoſe in this caſe, that the blood and nervous juyce grow too ſour, from the ſalt carried forth, and ſuffering a Flux, and therefore that they are ſomewhat looſned in their mixture, and fuſed ſo much into ſeroſity, as to be made fit for it. For it is to be obſerved, that all Liquids, though more thick and mucilaginous, if they be kept to a ſourneſs, preſently become for the moſt part wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and limpid: alſo the flowing down of the Urine is ſometimes ſeen to ariſe from ſuch a diſpoſition of the blood and humors: for that the Urine ſo copiouſly excreted, is like Vinegar in taſte; and theſe kind of diſtempers are uſually cured, chiefly by Chalybeates, and not by binding and thickning things.</p>
                           <p>But as to what reſpects the Colour, the Urine of ſound people may be the ſquare or rule, to which all the reſt of the ſick may be referred; for as the colour of ſound peoples is Citron, the Urine of the ſick is paler than Citron, and ſo either watry, or white, or higher coloured than it; whoſe chief kinds are, flame-colour, yellow, red, green, and black. I ſhall run through every one of theſe briefly, and endeavour to weigh them together, by what cauſes all the alterations may be made, and what diſtempers, or proviſions of diſeaſes they are wont to make known.</p>
                           <p>The Urine is watry or limpid, when by reaſon of the indigeſtion of the Ventricle, the ſaline and ſulphureous particles of things eaten, are not rightly ſubjugated, nor being ſmally broken, are made ſo volatile, that being diſſolved in the Serum, they may impart to it a tincture, which it may carry with it, through the ſeveral turnings and windings of its paſſage: For the Latex or juyce to be changed into Urine, becauſe it is forced through very ſecret paſſages, and narrow, as it were by a certain diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; therefore it is wholly deprived of the colour and conſiſtency, which it had from the taken Liquids, and imbibes almoſt nothing, but the volatile part, from the Chyme, whoſe Vehicle it is. Wherefore, if by reaſon of the great crudity, the Salt, Sulphur, and other contents are not firſt made volatile in the Viſcera, nor afterwards diſſolved in the Veſſels, that they may make their paſſage together with the ſerous juyce; it being at laſt ſtripped almoſt of all, is ſent out like clear water. That ſuch Urines do want the active principles, it is a ſign, becauſe they are kept a long time from putrefaction: This ſort of Urine denotes in Virgins, for the moſt part, the Green-ſickneſs, in moſt the Cachexy or Dropſie; in all it is a note of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtion and crudity. Sometimes in thoſe obnoxious to the Stone, it foretels the approach of the fit, <hi>viz.</hi> whilſt the Serum is coagulated by the ſtony juyce in the Reins, its diſſolutions and contents are congealed into a tartareous matter, only a watry juyce or Latex ſtaying behind. Thoſe who for ſome time make a thin and watry Urine, whatever ſickneſs they are obnoxious to, have often adjoyned to it a difficulty of breathing, and ſhortneſs thereof after motion, and a diſtention about the region of the Ventricle, and as it were a ſwelling up after eating. The reaſon of the former wholly depends on the defect of ſpirits in the blood, becauſe its liquor is not fully imbued with active principles (of Spirit, Sulphur, and Salt) rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted; therefore it is not ſufficiently kindled by the ferment of the heart, whereby the whole may preſently leap forth, and break as it were into a flame: but that hardly fermenting, and being apt to ſtagnate in the heart, and for the moſt part to reſide there, burdens it grievouſly: wherefore if the blood ſo diſpoſed, is urged more than it is wont, by a more quick motion, into the boſom of the Heart, becauſe not being rarified of its own accord, it may preſently go wholly forth, therefore there is need of great endeavour of the Lungs, and a more quick or frequent agitation, whereby it may be carried forth. Therefore watry Urines ſignifie this kind of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in the blood; becauſe, for as much as they receive no tincture almoſt from the Salt and Sulphur, it is a ſign that the Particles are little diſſolved in the maſs of blood, or are rendred volatile. As to what appertains to the inflation of the Ventricle (of which alſo limpid or clear Urines are the effect and ſign) I ſay, becauſe of a defect of due Fermentation, the Chyle goes not into a volatile Cream, but (like bread not fermented) into a ſad and heavy maſs; which indeed is ſlowly, and not without a reſidence of viſcous Phlegm, carried out of the ſtomach: its reliques being impacted in the folds and Membranes of the Ventricle, obſtruct all the Pores and paſſages, that nothing may vapour forth, nor that the thin and ſpirituous part may be conveyed (as it ought to be) by the ſecret paſſages, to the blood: hence flatulencies are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152521:101"/>
which continually diſtend the Ventricle, and blow it up beyond its due bulk: alſo when thoſe Feculencies are left a long time in the ſtomach, they abound in a fixed Salt, and degenerate now into an acid, now into a vitriolick matter, or of ſome other nature; from whence Heart-aches, deſire of abſurd things, oftentimes Heat with cruel thirſt, and ſometimes Vomiting ariſe: ſome of which though they argue a very ſharp heat to lye hid within, yet by reaſon of the want of concoction, ſuch diſtempers often render the Urine crude and watry. We have treated thus largely of a limpid or clear Urine, becauſe from hence the reaſons of the reſt (which as to colour and conſiſtency are pale and thin in healthful perſons) may be drawn. For from the Salt and Sulphur, more or leſs diſſolved and boiled in the Serum, the appearances of a pale and ſtraw-coloured Urine, and of other colours, under a Citron colour, are excited; and by the like means, which was ſaid of the watry, they may be unfolded.</p>
                           <p>There remains another certain kind of Urine, more pale than the Citron colour, not thin, but thick and cloudy, and of a whitiſh colour; it appears by common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that children do often make ſuch water, when they are troubled with the Worms: The reaſon of which ſeems, becauſe the matter whereof the worms are made, is a certain viſcous Phlegm, heaped up in the Viſcera, by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtion of the Chyle, and a defect of making or generating Spirits, which matter at firſt tranſmits no tincture to the Urine, becauſe of its fixity, the ſame afterwards putrifying is exalted, and is in ſome manner volatilized; and then partly by heat and ſpirit, is formed into worms, and partly being confuſed with the paſſing Chyle, and carried into the veſſels, when 'tis made unfit for nouriſhment, it is ſeparated with the Serum from the blood, and being mixed with the Urine, gives it that white co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Sometimes alſo in Feavers, eſpecially of children, the Urine is whitiſh: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which is, becauſe the ſupplement of the nutritious juyce being poured from the Chyle to the maſs of blood, is not rightly aſſimilated, but degenerates into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious humor: A portion of which being incocted in the Serum, imparts to it the thick conſiſtence and milky colour: otherwiſe than in the Feavers of thoſe of riper years, where when the heat is ſtronger, the ſame degenerate juyce impreſſes on the Serum a red colour. Alſo the Urine is whitiſh in the flowing of the Whites, the Gonorrhoea, Ulcers of the Reins and Bladder, and of the urinary paſſages, by reaſon of the confuſion or mingling of the filthy matter, or the corrupted ſeed: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, that the colour of the urine be white, it is produced from its contents, which at laſt putting down its ſettlement to the bottom, the liquor for the moſt part becomes of a paliſh and yellowiſh colour; even as it may be perceived by the making of the Milk of Sulphur, where the milky ſubſtance ſinking down to the bottom, the over ſwimming liquor is of a Citron colour.</p>
                           <p>Urines whoſe colour is deeper than Citron, owe their appearance, not only to the Salt and Sulphur diſſolved more than uſual, but in ſome ſort to the more thick contents in the liquor. The more plentiful diſſolution of the Salt and the Sulphur, is chiefly performed in the veſſels, in the maſs it ſelf of the blood, and from thence the Tincture is impreſſed on the ſerous Juyce: But this happens to be done for the moſt part, after a double manner, <hi>viz.</hi> either by reaſon of the feaveriſh fervour, for as much as the blood boiling in the veſſels, and being more kindled in the Heart, is very much looſned in its mixture, and ſo copiouſly fixes on the Serum the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Salt and Sulphur, waſted as it were by the boiling: Or without a Feaver, when theſe kind of ſulphureous and ſaline little bodies, wont to be ſent forth at other ſinks, are reſtrained; and ſo being by degrees heaped up in the blood, are poured into the Serum. Of this alſo there are two chief cauſes or means; for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the excrements of the blood, which chiefly participate of aduſt Sulphur, and that ought to be ſent away by Choler-carrying veſſels, are retained, and ſo they impreſs, being ſuffuſed on the ſerous humor, a tincture of yellowneſs: or elſe the Effluvia's, which are chiefly of a ſaline nature, and ought to be evaporated by inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible tranſpiration, are reſtrained, and from thoſe the urine is filled with a lixivial tincture. The urines of the former kind are proper to people that have the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; but thoſe of this latter are familiar to the Scurvy: for in the Scurvy the ſaline particles of the blood depart from volatilization, and get a Flux: wherefore, by reaſon of their fixity, they will not evaporate, and ſo being more fully heaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the blood, they more and more pervert its Craſis, and very much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate the ſerous humor with a ſaltneſs. The contents which heighten the colour
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152521:102"/>
of the urine, are of a twofold kind, to wit, either aduſt recrements, remaining after the deflagration of the blood, or particles of the nutritious juyce, degenerated into an extraneous matter: Concerning which we ſhall ſpeak hereafter in their proper place. It now remains that we deſcribe particularly the ſeveral Colours of Urine more intenſe or deep than Citron colour.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The firſt is a flame-coloured urine, which ſhines with a brightneſs like the Spirit of Nitre: and this is very often ſeen in an intermitting Tertian Feaver; this colour ariſes from a portion of the thinner yellow Bile, mixed with the Serum, whilſt it is in motion: for that in this Feaver there is a ſharp and hot intemperature of the blood, which burns and ſcorches all the humors, and ſo plentifully begets Choler. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this, for the moſt part, is ſeparated from the maſs of blood by the bilary veſſels and paſſages; yet when it abounds in the veſſels, a part of it, or (which is the ſame thing) ſome burnt and aduſt particles of the blood and humors being boiled in the ſerous water, impart to it an high or deep yellowneſs. This urine is thin and ſhining, for that there is in this diſeaſe almoſt a continual breathing forth, that thruſts out the recrements of the nutritious Juyce, and all the thicker parts of the Serum towards the circumference of the body.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The Saffron-coloured urine, and which dyes Linen with the ſame colour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly is a ſign of the Jaundice: it is tinged after this manner by the yellow Bile or Choler, or by the Salt and Sulphur burnt and plentifully mixt with the Serum: for the yellow Bile is neceſſarily begot from the yoked heat and motion of the blood; but for this the Gall bag is deſigned by Nature, for the ſeparating it from the maſs of the blood, its paſſages being rooted in the Liver: But if ſuch a ſeparation be any ways hindred, that humor flowing back in the blood, and copiouſly heaped together, infects the skin with its yellowneſs, the blood, and eſpecially the ſerous Latex. The Saffron-coloured urine differs from the flame-coloured, becauſe in this only a certain portion of the more thin Bile is poured into the urine, but in that the more thick part, and much more plenty: beſides, in the yellow Bile the Sulphur, with the Salt, being joyned and long circulated, is fully diſſolved by it, that it becomes like paint, imparting to every ſubject a Saffron-coloured tincture; as when common Sulphur and Oyl of Tartar are mixed together. But what things cauſe a redneſs in urines, without the reſtagnation of this Bile, happen after the ſame manner, as in the Lye of Aſhes: where the particles of the Sulphur, without any previous diſpoſition from the ſaline, are forthwith put down with them in the Liquor.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. It remains that we ſpeak next of red Urines, which are of a divers habit, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they always depend on the ſame cauſes, nor plainly denote the ſame kind of diſtempers; we ſhall briefly run through the chief differences and proper ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them. Firſt, the liquor of the urine is either red of it ſelf, and remains after the ſame manner, nor is the colour altered by the ſetling or ſinking down of any of the parts: or ſecondly, the redneſs of the urine chiefly owes its colour to the Contents, which being ſetled to the bottom, the liquor grows yellow, or is leſs red. The diſtempers that theſe kind of urines are wont to ſhew, are chiefly Feavers, and a confirmed Scurvy, and Conſumption. We ſhall conſider the reaſons of each.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. When the Urine that is made red ſo remains, it is firſt either of a mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency, and ſomewhat clear, and then it owes its colour to the Salt and Sulphur, being burnt more than uſual, and ſo boiled more copiouſly in the Serum: or ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch an urine is red, and alſo troubled and cloudy: but this, beſides the contents of Salt and Sulphur, has boiled in it ſome earthy particles alſo, which indeed being impacted in the Pores and paſſages of the ſerous Latex, do not deſcend: becauſe the liquor of the urine is deſtitute of convenient ſpirits, which may ſegregate all hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneous things, and drive them to the bottom, as is wont to happen uſually in dead drink, or Beer growing ſour by reaſon of Thunder; where the liquor is infected with a troubled Feces, and by reaſon of the defect of ſpirits, will not grow clear; wherefore this kind of urine is a very bad ſign in Feavers, becauſe it ſhews ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in the blood of aduſt and to be ſeparated matter, ſuch as the vital ſpirits are not able to maſter by taming and ſubjugating it.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Sometimes the Urine is made red, by reaſon of its contents; which ſetling in the bottom, the liquor becomes of another colour: but theſe contents, as before we hinted, are twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> now thin, which are the remaining matter, or aduſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements after the burning forth of the blood; now more thick, to wit, the dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate particles of the nutritious Juyce; both theſe being torrified, and ſeparated from
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152521:102"/>
the burning blood, are partly thruſt forth by Sweat, and partly mixed with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Latex, thicken its conſiſtence, and heighten its colour, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo long as theſe kind of contents are included in the Pores and paſſages of the liquor, they are ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the colour of the urine appears more deep, and the conſiſtency thicker: but theſe being precipitated to the bottom, both the redneſs and thickneſs of the liquor are leſſened. The reaſon of this ſhall be given anon, where we ſhall ſpeak of the Cauſes of the Colours, and alſo of the Clearneſs and Cloudineſs of Urines: we ſhall now inquire, what is the reaſon of the difference, that red urines are wont to be made both in Feavers, and alſo in the Scurvy, Conſumption, and perhaps in ſeveral other diſtempers.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. In Feavers, the liquor of the Urine is filled with redneſs, becauſe of the more plentiful diſſolution of the Salt and Sulphur, and their particles copiouſly boiled in the Serum; for whilſt the blood and humors grow hot, from the feaveriſh cauſe, by reaſon of the heat being more fully inkindled, the ſaline and ſulphureous little bodies, being burnt and torrified, are more diſſolved; and being boiled in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Juyce, impart to it a deeper tincture: Even as if the Lye of Aſhes be boiled over the fire, it grows more red, than if it were only made by infuſion. Alſo in Feavers, the contents of the urine moſt often increaſe its colour, <hi>viz.</hi> by reaſon of the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and deflagration of the blood, both the degenerate particles of the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juyce, and alſo other matter (as it were the Aſhes remaining of the burning of the blood) are burnt together, as it were into a reddiſh Calx; which being included in the Pores of the urine, renders its colour deep, and afterwards ſinking down, makes a ſediment like red Oker.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. In a long Scurvy, the liquor of the Urine grows ſometimes ſo highly red, that it cannot be greater in a burning Feaver: if ſuch urine be evaporated, or expoſed to diſtillation, it will ſhew great plenty of Salt, with a muddy Feces or dregs: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſeems to be manifeſt, that this deep redneſs doth chiefly ariſe from the Salt, (as we have already hinted) by this Experiment; becauſe in Scorbutick people the ſaline particles, which ought to be made volatile, and ſo conſtantly exhaled by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration, become fixed, and being hindred from a flux, are heaped together more plentifully in the diſtempered body. The Salt remaining within, is variouſly coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Sulphur and Earth, and then is continually diſſolved: and from this diverſe coagulation and diſſolution, the to be admired Symptoms of this Diſeaſe are cauſed. Alſo from the ſaline little bodies plentifully diſſolved with Tartarous feculencies, and diluted with the Serum, urines are filled with an high redneſs; to which moſt often happen in this inveterate diſeaſe vices of the Liver and Gall; for when theſe Inwards, being either obſtructed or other ways depraved, cannot perform their tasks, for the ſeparating the aduſt particles of the blood, they being more fully heaped up in the blood, are diſſolved in the ſerous Juyce, and infect it yet with a more lixivial tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. And if the aduſt particles of the Sulphur do excel the reſt of the fixed and ſcorbutick Salt, the yellow Jaundice happens together with the Scurvy, and the urine fixes to Linen a Saffrony tincture. But if they be leſs than they, and that the ſaline particles excel, the Scorbutick diſtemper only is produced, in which the urine is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſly red, yet does not dye the Linen. I am perſwaded that it is thus; becauſe, when I have opened the dead carcaſſes of many dead of the Scurvy, in whom there was a red urine, I obſerved that the Liver or Gall was in fault: In ſome the Liver was wholly without blood, and dry like a Cows Udder; in others the bag of the Gall was empty, and nothing in it; in others it was beſet with little ſtones; in others it was filled with filth, not bitter; in all theſe Inwards were ſo diſtempered, that the ſecretion of the Bile was hindred.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. By reaſon of this kind of diſſolution of the Salt, Urines ſometimes grow red in Arthritick diſeaſes: for beſides the Gout (in which ſuch urine is often made) I have obſerved in ſome a painful diſtemper, and as it were like a Feaver, cauſed, with a very high-coloured urine; they had wandring pains, now in this place, now in that, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly tormenting, that the ſick were ſcarce able to ſtand, or to ſtir their limbs: they were obnoxious to wakings and frequent ſweats; they were alſo troubled much with thirſt, and heat of their mouth: and they had a urine highly red, with a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful red ſediment. In the mean time it did not appear, either by the Pulſe, languiſhing of the Spirits, or Head-aches, that the blood grew exceſſively hot, or that they had a Feaver. Wherefore I ſuppoſe that this kind of diſtemper doth chiefly conſiſt in the nervous ſtock, and depends on the exorbitances of the ſaline Principle, rather than the ſulphureous.</p>
                           <p n="4">
                              <pb n="12" facs="tcp:152521:103"/>4. Alſo in the confirmed Phthiſis or Conſumption, eſpecially if an Hectick Feaver be joyned with it, there is a red Urine; the reaſon of which is, if at any time an Ulcer is excited in the Lungs, the putrid filth from thence being mingled with the blood ſliding by, cauſes in it almoſt a continual efferveſcency, whereby the ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous and ſaline particles being more plentifully diſſolved and boiled in the Serum, affect its liquor with redneſs: beſides, by reaſon of the blood being defiled after this manner, the nouriſhing Juyce degenerates almoſt wholly into putrefaction, by whoſe recrements the urine being filled, grows more red, and is very much ſtuffed with contents: The ſign or note of this is, that the ſick for the moſt part grow hot after eating, and that they are troubled with an heat through their whole body, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with a nightly ſweat; beſides, their urines yield a thick and copious ſediment, to wit, when the nouriſhing Juyce, being mixed with the blood, is not aſſimilated, it ſtirs up in it a fervour, and being degenerate into an extraneous matter, exhales partly by ſweat through the Pores of the skin, and partly being tranſmitted to the urine, very much heightens its colour and conſiſtency.</p>
                           <p>Thus far of a red Urine, whoſe ſeveral ſpecies, but now related, have more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of intention and remiſſion, accordingly as the cauſes, altering the colour and conſiſtence in them, are either weaker or ſtronger.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. As to what belongs to a green and black Urine, I confeſs I have never ſeen thoſe kind of deep colours (exactly like thoſe of Leeks and Ink) in any urine: but I imagine I may have ſeen the appearance of a greeniſh colour from a more deep yellow, and of a blackiſh urine from the ſame with a cloudy and ſomewhat a dark mixture, and from thence called by Authors a green and black Urine. But thoſe urines, coloured after that manner, are eſteemed either ſigns of the Jaundice, or of being diſtempered with ſome virulency of the blood, if they continue ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly for ſome time: or ſuch urines, as occaſion offers, are variouſly changed, and are now of this or that, and preſently of another colour. So I have known Hypochondriacks wont to make ſuch urines, as it were critically for ſome time, and then afterwards to render them like ſound men. As to the firſt, when the Jaundice is very great upon them, that the aduſt portions of Sulphur and Salt remain a long time in the maſs of blood, they acquire by a long incoction a fulneſs of the yellow colour, at firſt green, and afterwards black, and impart the ſame to the Serum: For if the yellow Bile, being taken out of the bag of the Gall, and put into a Cucurbit, be expoſed to the gentle heat of a Bath, the ſame in a ſhort time will grow green, and afterwards appear like the blackeſt Ink: wherefore in the black Jaundice, which is only the yellow carried forth into a worſe ſtate, by its long ſtay or continuance, there is nothing more uſual than to make black urines. Beſides, theſe kind of urines ſometimes appear in a malignant Feaver, and in the Plague, alſo often from drinking of poyſon, and in this caſe it is for the moſt part a ſign of death, becauſe it argues the blood greatly corrupted, and the ſpirits profligated, and the bond of the mixture looſned, as it were the deadly or mortified diſtemper: even as where ſome part of our body, being diſtempered with an Ulcer, is afterward taken with a Gangrene or mortification, forthwith the flowing corrupt matter, which was at firſt white, wateriſh, or yellow, becomes black. Wherefore in the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diſtempers, when the urine grows black, the Serum and the blood being wholly vitiated, the skin alſo is dyed outwardly with ſuch a colour. As to what belongs to urines periodically tinctured with a greeniſh colour, and eſpecially with black (which happen often to Hypochondriacks) it is moſt likely, that ſuch ariſe from the melancholick Feculencies laid up in the Spleen, and from thence, by reaſon of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, too much flowing forth ſometimes, and confuſed with the blood: for ſuch a matter, being often poured into the Ventricle in ſome men, ſtirs up black Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; alſo in others, the ſame being ſupp'd up from the blood paſſing through, may impart ſuffuſions of the ſame colours to the ſerous Juyce.</p>
                           <p>So much for the Colours of Urines, of which the more pale ariſe from too much Crudity, almoſt all the high-coloured, either from the Salt and Sulphur plentifully diſſolved, and ſometimes from the aduſt recrements throughly boiled in the Serum, or from the more thick contents of the urine; whether they be the Calx and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the aliment, degenerated in the concoction, or the waſting or melting of the pining body, or ſome part of it evilly diſtempered: what hath been ſaid may be better underſtood, if the means, whereby theſe kind of diſſolved things or contents are able variouſly to change the colour of the urine, be unfolded.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="13" facs="tcp:152521:103"/>The cauſes of the diverſity of appearances of colours, and their variouſly chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as alſo of the cloudineſs and clearneſs in Urines, (as in all other Liquors) depend only on the various incidency and emerſion of the beams of light, as is hinted in another place, in the Tract of Fermentation: For if the ſubſtance of the liquor be rare and thin, with open Pores and paſſages, that the beams of light may eaſily paſs through, it is ſhining and clear like fountain-water: but if the Pores of the liquor be filled with contents, or little bodies ſwimming in it, ſo that the luminous beams are broken in their paſſage, but ſo that at length they may ſhew themſelves, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe various manners of refraction and emiſſion, there will appear a Citron, a Saffron, or red colour in a yet clear liquor. If that, in the little ſpaces of the Pores yet more obſtructed, the light cannot paſs through, there is a darkneſs induced: but then if the immerſed beams be a little or nothing reflected, the liquor will appear of a brown or dark colour; but if they are beaten back, according to the diverſe manner of reflection, a white, aſhy, or ſome other kind of appearance, is induced. From this being ſuppoſed, according as the liquor of the urine, ſometimes almoſt wholly deprived of Salt and Sulphur, and other things diſſolved, eaſily admits of light, ſometimes either very much ſtuffed, or elſe moderately with theſe kind of contents, either diſtorts the beams falling on them in their paſſage, or wholly imbibes them, or laſtly beats them back; it were eaſie to explicate all the Phenomena or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of colours and their conſiſtence.</p>
                           <p>It often happens, that the colour of the ſame Urine is variouſly changed: for what is made red, being expoſed to the air, becomes white, or of a dark colour, and then after a long time of a Citron colour: the reaſon of which is this, if I am not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, this kind of urine, when it is made, is red, becauſe the Pores of the Liquor are very full of contents; yet ſo long as they are dilated with heat, they tranſmit the rays of light, (although variouſly diſtorted) that they may at length ſhew themſelves or appear; but this urine is no ſooner expoſed to the cold, but that the Pores being ſtraitned, the ſite and poſition of the parts is changed in the contents, and by that means the paſſage of the beams of light is hindred: wherefore the liquor preſently becomes cloudy, and according as thoſe beams are reflected after this or that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, a white, or brown, or ſome other kind of colour is induced: but at length the contents falling down towards the bottom with their weight, the Pores being freed, tranſmit again the rays of light, and do not diſtort them; wherefore a clear or a Citron colour appears.</p>
                           <p>From theſe things which have been ſpoken concerning the Colours of Urines, may appear what is the cauſe of the various conſiſtence of urines. For as the particles of Salt and Sulphur, of the aduſt matter, or nutritious Juyce, depraved in the aſſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, are more or leſs boiled in the Serum, urines alſo get their more thin or thick conſiſtency. It remains next that we ſpeak more clearly of the Contents in preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Urines, whereof we have often made mention.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Contents in the Urines of ſick People.</head>
                           <p>WE ſuppoſe the Contents in the Urines of ſick people to be twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> either univerſal, which proceed from the maſs of Blood, and of the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Liquor, and reſpect the habit of the whole Body; or particular, which are the layings aſide or excrements of one bowel, or part ill affected, of which we ſhall ſpeak anon. Thoſe of the former kind, which come away from the whole, are either natural, <hi>viz.</hi> Filaments or ſmall threads conſtituting the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis or ſettlement, as in ſound Urines; or preternatural, which chiefly are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the nutritious humour degenerate from aſſimilation, and conſtitute the more thick bodies of the ſediment in Urines; and laſtly to theſe, (if there be a feaveriſh intemperance) the aduſt matter of the blood after deflagration, and diluted in the ſerous Juyce, is added, and increaſes the bulk of the Contents.</p>
                           <p>But theſe Contents, both natural and preternatural, of Urines, repreſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after a various manner, as the blood more or leſs unduly grows hot, alſo as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152521:104"/>
the aliments in the bowels and veſſels are variouſly concocted, and either the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities or corruptions of the Chyme, from thence made, are waſhed away with the Serum: for if the nouriſhable humour tranſmitted to the blood, is not all perverted, but a great portion of it, laid upon the ſolid parts, is changed into nouriſhment, ſome parts of this alſo rightly made, being mixed with the Serum, impreſs yet ſome marks of an Hypoſtaſis in urines: Alſo from the aduſt or degenerate matter, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural ſediment is framed, yet little and thin, neither doth it wholly blot out the appearances of this natural. Wherefore in the beginning and declination of a Feaver, ſometimes alſo in a Conſumption, or a Cachexy an Hypoſtaſis, though not ſo perfect, is perceived. If that the greater portion of the ſame Chyme, growing hot with the blood, by reaſon of the immoderate heat, is perverted into an hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene matter, which afterward is ſent away with the Serum, as hurtful and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, preſently an obſcure and imperfect Hypoſtaſis appears; and beſides it, very many contents are ſeen in the urines, which heighten their colour and conſiſtency. Such an urine, which contains an Hypoſtaſis, though imperfect, together with other things of the ſame kind diſſolved in it, if it be kept in a warm place, the Hypoſtaſis will be perceived alone; but the reſt of the contents, comprehended in the pores of the urine, dilated by the heat, are made wholly inconſpicuous or not to be ſeen: yet afterwards the little ſpaces of the Pores being ſtraitned by cold, the ſame contents are precipitated, and by that means they render the ſite and poſition changed, and the urine troubled and cloudy, and blot out the appearance of the Hypoſtaſis. Theſe kind of urines in the better ſtate of Feavers, in a Catarrh, Cough, difficulty of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, fulneſs of humours, and in the more light Dyſcraſies are wont to be made.</p>
                           <p>But if in the more grievous ſtate of ſickneſs the Concoction be wholly vitiated, and the whole nutritious Juyce changed into a putrefaction, theſe kind of contents alſo may be perceived in the urine without an Hypoſtaſis, and ſignifies variouſly in diſeaſes, after their various ways of being precipitated, and ſinking down, and conſtituting a diverſe kind of ſediment; to wit, as the ſeparation of the parts ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſoon or late, or not at all; and as the matter falling down ſhall be little or much, or alſo of a white, red, or dark colour. I will briefly run through what is moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and worthy obſervation concerning this thing.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. This kind of Urine being full of contents, is not ſometimes at all precipitated, (unleſs the ſubſtance of the liquor be diſſolved by putrefaction a long time after) but remains a long while troubled and ſomewhat cloudy, with little bodies ſwimming through the whole. The reaſon of this is, either becauſe theſe contents are too much incocted in the Serum, ſo that the ſpirits implanted therein, cannot ſeparate the pure from the impure, the thick from the thin; as may be perceived in brewing Beer, if that the Mault be too much boiled, the liquor ſhall never grow clear: or elſe the urine remains troubled, becauſe it is wholly deſtitute of ſpirits, which may compel the parts of the liquor into the motion of Fermentation; as it uſually comes to paſs in Beer growing ſour by reaſon of Thunder, or of immoderate heat, and being infected with a troubled Feces or Lee, will ſcarce ever be rightly made clear again. This kind of urine is perceived for the moſt part in very dangerous Feavers, and ſometimes in a deſperate Cachexy, and always portends evil.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Sometimes it happens, that the Urine is ſo full of contents, that it begins to be troubled whilſt it is yet warm. I have often obſerved it, after this manner, in a ſlow Feaver, whoſe heat was gentle and more remiſs, to wit, in which the particles of the nutritious craſſament or ſubſtance are depraved, but being a little ſubdued by heat, or boiled in the Serum, they eaſily fall out of its pores: as when common Sulphur is boiled in Lye, if that before it be perfectly diſſolved, it be taken from the fire, the liquor at firſt clear and red, by reaſon of the quick precipitation of the diſſolved matter, becomes preſently troubled, dark, and of a ſomewhat whitiſh colour.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. But what moſt uſually comes to paſs, that this ſort of Urine, big with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, as long as it is hot, and ſome time after, ſeems clear and perſpicuous when it grows cold, is wont to be troubled, and as if ſome Runnet were infuſed to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated according to all its parts; yet the ſame, if held near the fire, or in warm water for a little ſpace, ſhall grow clear again. The reaſon of this is already fully unfolded, where we ſpake of the Cauſes of Cloudineſs and of Clearneſs.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. After that the Urine being expoſed to the cold, is precipitated in this manner,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152521:104"/>
it may be obſerved by what means its contents deſcend to the bottom; for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they ſettle in a ſhort time: and if the liquor grows clear in the ſpace of two or three hours, it is a ſign that the liquor of the urine is not too thick, nor very much filled with Salt and Sulphur: wherefore in the beginning or declination of Feavers, when the heat is ſlack, ſuch an urine is moſt often made: ſometimes ſuch a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment follows not but in the ſpace of many days; the reaſon of which is, becauſe the conſiſtence of the liquor is thicker than it ſhould be, therefore the contents or diſſolved things are not ſo eaſily let go from its embrace, that they may fall down to the bottom by their weight. Theſe kind of urines are wont to be made in the ſtate or height of Feavers, and moſt often precede an evil Criſis.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Of no leſs a diverſe kind are the ſediments which fall to the bottom. That I may paſs over in this place the filthy matter, and blood, ſand, gravel, and the like, depoſited from ſome parts, I ſhall mention thoſe which are the products of the whole body, and they for the moſt part are either white or brown, or red like Oker: If you ſtrain urine, when it hath ſtood long, through brown paper, you may collect theſe contents. I have often ſeen a whiteneſs like Chalk, and ſometimes red like Bole Armene, without doubt there is the ſame matter of all, to wit, the recrements of the deflagrated blood, and of the nutritious juyce depraved in the aſſimilating: which, as they are burnt by heat in our body, and diverſly perverted, appear alſo in the urine under a various colour and form; even as Antimony mixed with Nitre, as it is more or leſs calcined exhibits a Calx, now red, now Saffron-colour, now yellow, now brown: The like reaſon is (as it ſeems) of the ſediments of urines, which are as it were the Calx of the ſulphureous and earthy matter burnt forth by the fire of the Feaver in the Viſcera and Veſſels.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Beſides theſe kinds of Contents, which happen in the Urines of ſick people, I have often obſerved, that after the urine had ſtood a long while, ſomething was affixed to the ſides of the glaſs like ſand, and indeed in divers figures; for now theſe little bodies like ſand grow together with a ſharp and unequal ſuperficies, now with ridges like the Cryſtals of Nitre, and ſome ſhine and are pellucid like Ice. I have ſeen theſe kind of Cryſtals fixed to the Urinal, ſometimes in the urines of thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a Dyſentery, alſo in thoſe troubled with pertinacious wakings. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in urines, when they have ſtood long, a certain Cream will ſwim on the top, as when Tartar is boiled in water: this kind of whitiſh cruſt growing together in the ſuperficies of the urine, is commonly thought to be fat and fattiſh things, and taken for the melting of the ſolid parts: wherefore ſuch as are wont to make ſuch an urine, are preſently pronounced to be conſumptive, and in a deſperate condition: But indeed that is only a ſaline concretion, which if put into the fire, will not melt, but grows hard into a cruſty ſubſtance. Yea both this and the other concreſcences of urines are as it were the Tartar brought forth in them by a certain Coagulation: But ſuch a concretion depends altogether on the particles of the fluid or acetous Salt, combined with others of the fixed or Alcaliſate Salt: For in every ſubject where there is a commixtion of the Salts of either kind, Cryſtallizations and Coagulations of a diverſe manner are cauſed, either ſpontaneouſly by Nature, or may be procured by artificial ſeparation: wherefore this kind of urine, on which this Cream ſwims, or that Cryſtals gather in the ſides of the Veſſels, indicates the blood to be departed from its ſweet and Balſamick nature (ſuch as depends on the volatile Salt) into an acid and corroſive, by reaſon of the flux and fixity of the ſaline Principle. Such an urine, if it be evaporated, leaves in the bottom of the Veſſel great plenty of Salt: the diſtempers wherein it is uſually found (as I have often obſerved) are ſpitting of blood, Atrophy, or general waſting, and the Hypochondriack diſpoſition.</p>
                           <p>In the Urines of ſick people it is worth obſervation, whether they dye the Urinal or not? For ſometimes in Feavers the urine is no ſooner put into the Glaſs, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently it darkens its ſides with a whitiſh cloud, and again at another time this does not happen: I ſuppoſe that the Glaſs is dyed, when the liquor of the urine is fuller of diſſolved Sulphur than its pores can contain within themſelves; as may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in Lye, wherein common Sulphur or Antimony is boiled: Alſo every urine, if it ſtand in the Glaſs till it putrifie, will infect its ſides with a cruſt or cloud, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times whitiſh, ſometimes reddiſh, ſometimes of another colour: for the frame of the liquor being looſned by putrefaction, the particles of the Sulphur being looſned from the bond of mixture ſtick to the Glaſs: But in the urines of ſick people ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this preſently follows, becauſe the Sulphur is more copiouſly diſſolved than can be included in its pores.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="16" facs="tcp:152521:105"/>As to what reſpects the particular Contents of Urines, they indeed are manifold, and may come from many parts and places: yet they moſt often depend on diſeaſes implanted about the Reins, Bladder, and Urinary paſſages: ſometimes it happens by reaſon of an Impoſthume in the Liver, Spleen, Lungs, or other Inward; or by reaſon of preternatural humours heaped up in thoſe places, and flowing out with their fulneſs, an extraneous matter is tranſmitted into the maſs of blood, and thence into the ſerous Juyce: but this happens more rarely, becauſe an Impoſthume being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken within, for the moſt part pours out its matter into the cavities of the Viſcera, from which there is no paſſage open into the urinary paſſages: beſides the maſs of blood flowing with impurities, does not preſently endeavour to ſend them forth by urine, but oftner by ſweat, ſpitting, breaking out of Wheals, Tumors, or by other ways of excretion. Wherefore it appears by common obſervation, that the other contents of urines (than which we have above cited) are chiefly ſent from the Reins and their dependences; the chief of which are ſand, ſtones, blood, matter, bits of fleſh, skins, branny or mealy ſediments, which for the moſt part ſignifie either the ſtony or an ulcerous diſtemper, or both together, planted beyond the emulgent Veſſels.</p>
                           <p>It is an uſual thing for ſome to void with their water, gravel or ſmall find of a red colour in great quantity; ſome of theſe are obnoxious to the ſtone in the Reins, and are frequently tormented with Nephritick fits: I have alſo known others without pain, or other grievous Symptom, for a long time to make a ſandy water. All urines whatſoever, if they ſtand for ſome time in a leaded or earthy glazed veſſel, affix this kind of red land to the ſides and bottom of the Pot, to wit, the volatile Salt of the urine is coagulated with the fixed Salt of the Metal: ſo when Sal Armoniac being mixed with the filings of Steel, Sea-Salt, or Vitriol is ſublimated, the elevated flours grow notably red: wherefore it ſeems that theſe kind of little ſands are begot in the Reins, for that the Salt of the urine is coagulated with the Tartarous feculen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies laid up about the windings of the Reins, from whence the ſandy matter is made, which is preſently waſhed away by the ſerous Juyce paſſing through: Therefore the gravel that is ſo frequently made are no ſmall parts or fragments of a greater ſtone, (as is commonly thought) but extemporary products of the blood and Serum waſhing the winding paſſages of the Reins.</p>
                           <p>By what means little ſtones are produced in the Bladder or Reins, is not to be fully diſcourſed in this place: But without doubt it is done rather by Coagulation than Exſiccation or Excalefaction, by drying or heating. I have obſerved ſome ſick of the Stone in the Bladder, who after they have made water, were wont to void with great ſtriving and pain a thick and viſcous Juyce, which preſently hardned into a ſcaly matter: the ſmell of this was like Lye, and of ſuch a conſiſtence as Lye eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated to a thickneſs, the liquor of which being made thick, preſently ſtiffens into a ſaline hardneſs. Leſſer ſtones ſometimes paſs through the urinary paſſages, and are carried out: the greater remain unmoved in their Cells. The places wherein they are uſually begotten are the narrow winding boſoms of the Reins, from thence the ſmaller ſlide into the Bladder, and if not excerned, they grow into great ſtones. I once ſaw many great ſtones ſhut up as it were in a Cheſt about the ſides of the Bladder between its Membranes; theſe without doubt being ſent from the Reins while ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, remained in the paſſages of the Ureters, creeping between the Coats of the Bladder, and there by degrees did increaſe in bulk. A Matron ſo diſtempered long before her death, caſt out of the urinary paſſage a Membrane thick and broad, full of ſandy matter, which (as appeared after her body was opened) was part of the interior Tunick of the Bladder worn and broken by the ſtones there included.</p>
                           <p>It is ordinary for Nephritick people, or ſuch as are troubled with the Stone, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to void blood or matter with their Urine: for from a greater ſtone, and endued with ſharpneſs, the fleſh of the Reins is eaſily worn, and the mouths of the Veſſels opened, whereby blood flowing out tinges the urine; and when a ſolution of unity is cauſed in this manner in the Reins, an Ulcer moſt commonly follows, whereby matter and filthy ſtuff are poured out with the ſerous water, and conſtitute a plentiful and ſtinking ſediment in the urine: then the ſore being more inlarged by the Ulcer, more large profuſions of blood often follow, and the fleſh it ſelf of the Reins being worn away, and by degrees eaten off, is voided with the urine. I viſited once an ancient Woman, who daily voided with her urine, for many months, pure blood in great quantity; beſides, as often as ſhe made water, ſhe uſed to void in great
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:152521:105"/>
quantity pieces of fleſh, great gobbets, as it were the little Tubes of the Veſſels eaten away, that it was ſuſpected one of her Kidneys was all thus cut away from her body: yet afterwards by a vulnerary Decoction acidulated with Spirit of Vitriol, that bloody water was ſtaid, and this Woman lives ſtill well and in health. I knew another Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, who uſed for a long time in making water to void at firſt blood with a purulent matter, and Membranes: then the bloody water ceaſing, for many years ſhe made a wateriſh urine with a copious ſediment, and white like ſnot, ſinking down to the bottom of the Urinal. Afterwards when ſhe began to want that ſediment, a feave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh intemperance followed with pains wandring here and there, with a languiſhing of ſtrength, and other dangerous Symptoms: and when this ſick Woman was brought into danger of her life, a Tumor ariſing in her left ſide about her Reins, and ripening into a Boil or Sore, by reaſon of the large flowing out of the matter, freed her: but yet an hollow and ſinuous Ulcer pouring out a thin matter, remained in that place during her life: and being ſometimes healed up, would preſently break out again. Scarce two years after this Noble Lady having endured the ſuppreſſion of her urine for fourteen days, became apoplectick and dyed. Her body being opened, her left Kidney was quite gone, in the place of it a membranous ſubſtance growing to the Loyns, infolding the extremities of the Veſſels and Ureter, was grown up: ſome prints or marks of the Ureter remained, but without any opening into the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs of the paſſage: yea a certain ichor or ſeroſity dropping out from the little mouths of the emulgent Artery, was carried outwardly into that ſinuous Ulcer. The other Kidney was very full of ſandy matter and ſmall ſtones; beſides, near the top of the Ureter a ſtone about the bigneſs of ones thumb was fixed, whoſe extremity was ſo fitted and firmly impacted to the paſſage or cavity of the Ureter, that it ſhut it up juſt like a Tap, and quite hindered the paſſage of the ſerous Juyce. The purulent matter comes into the urine, not only from the Reins, but ſometimes out of the Bladder and urinary paſſage diſtempered with an Ulcer; and ſometimes alſo a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſeed, or white flux, or menſtruous blood are poured into urines from the Veſſels and genital parts, and produce in them preternatural ſettlements.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. In the Urines of ſick people are often ſeen abundance of white Contents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of moſt ſmall bodies; which, when they are ſetled, fill up above half the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and make it white and duskiſh, the reſt remaining limpid, and thin in the upper region of the Urinal: this kind of ſediment is called Mealy, becauſe it is like water imbued with meal. Concerning this it is doubtful, whether it proceeds from the whole maſs of blood, or only from the urinary Viſcera. It appears by obſervation, that the ſame ſort of urine is always made in the ſtone of the Bladder, alſo ſometimes by reaſon of the Kidney being oppreſſed with ſome great ſtone. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw ſuch a ſettlement in urines without a Nephritick diſtemper; wherefore I have thought it almoſt indubitable to be always a ſign of the Stone: And it ſeems that it ſhould wholly depend on the juyce or humour heaped up about the bulk or ſubſtance of the ſtone: For where the ſtone is fixed in the Kidney or Bladder, the nutritious humour is there perverted from aſſimilation, and degenerates into a more thick mucor, which uſes to be copiouſly heaped up; like Ichor, which by reaſon of a Pea put into an Iſſue, runs out plentifully. But this mucor or filth being waſhed with Serum, makes that white ſediment.</p>

                           <p>SO much for the Anatomy of Urines, wherein are unfolded their Elements and conſtitutive Principles, together with their chief Accidents, <hi>viz.</hi> Colour, Conſiſtence, and Contents, both what ought naturally to be in them <hi>per eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam</hi> or eſſentially, and alſo what are wont to happen to them preternaturally, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the body being ill affected. It will be eaſie for any one to accommodate this Hypotheſis to practice, and to give Judgment on Urines beholding them in the Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; for from what hath been ſaid it appears of what parts the Diſeaſes are made known by the inſpection of the Urines, and what the Urine ſignifies in each of them.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152521:106"/>
Concerning this ſubject there hath been enough ſaid by Authors; I ſhall therefore only touch upon it briefly, and lightly paſs it over.</p>
                           <p>Although the matter of Urine, <hi>viz.</hi> the Serum of the blood waſhes the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Body, and is circulated with the blood through all the ſeveral parts, yet it doth not lay open the condition and diſeaſes of them all, but only of thoſe to which it owes either the natural perfection and geneſis of it ſelf, or from which it receives every alteration: wherefore in ſome reſpect it ſhews the action and diſpoſition of the Viſcera ſerving to Concoction, and beſides denotes the temper and motion of the blood and humours in the Veſſels: but that any one ſhould pretend to know from the Urinal, and to divine a pain in the Head, an Impoſthume in the Throat, or any other Diſeaſe of any part, from whence nothing is communicated to the Serum, he ſhews rather his ignorance than the knowledge of any Diſeaſe.</p>
                           <p>Urines brought from ſick perſons ſometimes are wholly like thoſe of ſound peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and then they give no light to the diſeaſe or diſtempered part; but it may be lawful, having inſpected them, to ſay ſomething negatively, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Patient is free from a Feaver, that as to the Ventricle and Concoction of the food, they are indifferently well: wherefore unleſs he be inclining to a Conſumption, or is ſick of an Impoſthume, or ſome other diſeaſe of the unity being broken; whatſoever it be, the diſtemper ſeems not very dangerous or hard to be cured.</p>
                           <p>But in the mean time I would not have him declare any thing raſhly, nor proceed farther than he can with ſafety return: for I have often obſerved in ſome moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous diſtempers, <hi>viz.</hi> in a malignant Feaver, when with loſs of ſtrength, a weak and unequal Pulſe, eruption of Spots, and other dangerous Symptoms, the Patients have been deſperately ſick, that the urines as to the colour, conſiſtence, and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſis, have been laudable, as in ſound perſons, ſo that in ſuch a caſe the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician by only viewing the Urine, as to his Prognoſtication had grievouſly erred: wherefore there is ſcarce credit to be given to the ſingle teſtimony of the Urine, unleſs there be other ſigns agreeable; but that it is a lyar in the Plague and malignant Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and deceives: the reaſon is, that in thoſe diſeaſes the blood is leiſurely, and as it were ſilently corrupted, ſometimes without any great fervour: and ſo, although its liquor be infected by Coagulation, or by mortification or deadneſs; yet becauſe it doth not burn out much at the ſame time, ſo as to make an heap of aduſt matter, as of Aſhes, the Serum is little or nothing altered from its uſual diſpoſition or tenour: Beſides, ſometimes when in ſuch a ſickneſs the blood grows very hot, whatever of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious is heaped up in its maſs, is preſently transferred to the Brain and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſtock: wherefore the ſerous water being free from preternatural contents, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains after its uſual manner; beſides this caſe, when the Urines appear of a deep colour, troubled, and without any ſediment, there is no reaſon why the Piſs-prophet ſhould make a Prognoſtication.</p>
                           <p>As often as the Urines of ſick people are unlike thoſe of ſound, either ſomething natural is wanting, or what is preternatural is added, or it happens both together.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. There may be wanting Colour, Conſiſtence, Contents, and Quantity. If the Colour be more remiſs than it ſhould, and the Liquor paler, it indicates Crudity, and a defect of making Spirits, to wit, that the nouriſhing Juyce is not rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted or exalted either in the Viſcera or in the Veſſels; ſo that the ſaline and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Particles being carried out together, following the diſtribution as it were the diſtillation of the Serum, might throughly ſtick to the ſame, and impart alſo to it the tincture: wherefore ſuch Urine being viewed from theſe kind of Symptoms, you may unfitly divine, that there is a weight in the Ventricle, want of Appetite, evil Digeſtion, a tenſion in the Hypochondria, an unfitneſs for motion, ſleepineſs, difficult breathing, and a frequent palpitation of the Heart upon exerciſe, a pale colour, a ſwelling of the Feet and Belly, you may ſay they are in danger of falling (if not already fallen) into a Cachexy or Dropſie, and if it be a Maid, that ſhe is troubled with Longings and the Green-ſickneſs.</p>
                           <p>If the Colour of Urines be remitted in a Feaver without a Criſis, it is a ſign that the fermentative matter or aduſt recrements of the blood are ſeparated from the boſom of the blood, and fixed ſomewhere, which for the moſt part happens in the Brain; and for that cauſe ſuch Urines uſe to foretel a Delirium or Phrenſie; in thoſe troubled with the Stone, a ſudden alteration of the urine into a pale and watry co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, denotes the approach of a Fit.</p>
                           <p>A copious and pale Urine often ſhews the too great reſolution or melting of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:152521:106"/>
Salts, by reaſon whereof the ſeroſities are ſent away as it were in a flood from the whole body, and chiefly from the nervous parts: ſuch an Excretion ſometimes is healthful, and as it were critical, when the ſuperfluities happen only to be carried away: ſometimes it is ſymptomatick, and cauſes a great debility, to wit, becauſe the nutritious Juyce and the good humours are purged out.</p>
                           <p>If the Conſiſtence be thin, and the Liquor pale, it argues Crudity, want of Spirits, or too much Drinking, or the Nephritick diſtemper: if it be of a flame-colour, it is a ſign of an intermitting Tertian Feaver.</p>
                           <p>If the Contents be wanting, and it be pale, want of Concoction is ſignified, and a Cachectick diſtemper of the body. But if it be of a Citron colour, and the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency mean, without Hypoſtaſis, you may ſuppoſe the Patient to have uſed too much labour or exerciſe; or to be frequently diſtempered with Sweats in the night, or perhaps to have an Atrophy, or general waſting, or to be inclining to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
                           <p>If the Urine be continually made in a leſſer quantity than it ſhould, unleſs there be a larger tranſpiration, it is a ſign that the blood is not ſufficiently purged from the ſerous Juyce: wherefore there is a neceſſity that it become more watry, and that at length a Cachectical diſpoſition of the body, or a Dropſie be brought in. But if it be ſuddenly ſuppreſſed, or made with pain and difficulty, it is a ſign of the Stone or Gravel.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Something is added to the Urine, to wit, when the colour is heightned, and in the mean time the conſiſtency and contents ſhew themſelves in due meaſure, there may then be a ſuſpicion of a Feaveriſh or Hectical diſtemper: perhaps ſome evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent cauſe may precede, as the uſe of Baths, Heat, Surfeit, or immoderate Exerciſe, which might have heated the blood; or Cold may have heedleſly been taken, whence may ariſe a ſhutting up of the Pores, and difficulty of Perſpiration. If the urine be of a Saffron-colour, and tinges the Linen with yellowneſs, you may ſay it is the Jaundice: but if it be of a Saffron colour or red without a Feaver, and doth not dye Linen, it ſhews for the moſt part the Scurvy or Hypochondriack diſpoſition.</p>
                           <p>Though the Colour and Hypoſtaſis may be in good order, preternatural Contents are often in the Urine; therefore when it grows cold it is troubled, and makes a ſediment ſometimes white, and then there is a ſuſpicion of the blood's overflowing with filth, alſo of an impure Ventricle ſtuffed with excrementitious matter, or with Worms; ſometimes red, which often happens by reaſon of Tranſpiration being hindred, a Conſumption, and ſometimes by reaſon of a Surfeit, or the beginning of a Feaver.</p>
                           <p>Preternatural and thicker Contents are ſometimes in Urines, ſhewing themſelves naturally, which denotes a diſtemper of ſome part about the urinary paſſages; whence Matter, Filth, Blood, the Whites, corrupt Seed, or the like, are mixed with the Urine: and you may eaſily know by asking how, and in what place the Patient is ill, what part is diſtempered; and the ſtraining the ſediments of thoſe urines will ſhew what the diſeaſe is, and you may be more ſure of the nature of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</p>
                           <p>When Urines have ſtood ſome time, copious white ſediments are thence made; it is not eaſie at firſt ſight to know from whence they come, <hi>viz.</hi> whether from the whole maſs of blood, or only from a particular bowel imployed for the preparations of the Serum or the Seed. For the impurities of the blood and nervous juyce being depoſited under a mealy ſpecies in the bottom of the Urinal, are wont to cauſe a ſuſpicion in the Phyſician of the Whites in Women, and of the Running of the Reins in Men: ſuch like contents are alſo ſeen in Urines, which proceed from the urinary and ſpermatick parts. Amidſt theſe ambiguities, leſt you ſhould gueſs raſhly and confidently by the urine, and aſſert uncertain for certain things, and falſhood for truth, the difference of theſe kind of urines ought to be indicated after this manner. If the contents be univerſal, and their ſigns be to be applied to the maſs of blood; for the moſt part theſe preſently after the making (unleſs ſometimes by chance in a Critical ſeparation) are wholly inconſpicuous (as in a thinner ſubſtance,) then the urine being troubled by cold, they deſcend ſlowly to the bottom; and being ſetled, and the Urinal heated, they diſappear again. But if theſe white ſettlements are ſent from a particular neſt, they preſently diſturb and thicken the urine newly made, are ſoon precipitated, and vaniſh not by heat. But that it may appear to what bowel theſe kind of particular contents ſhould be aſcribed, 'tis eaſily made known to Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men by other circumſtances.</p>
                           <p n="3">
                              <pb n="20" facs="tcp:152521:107"/>3. The Urine is ſometimes wholly altered from the natural ſtate; the colour and contents which ſhould be therein are wanting, and ſtrange things are in their place; then indeed is indicated that there is an intemperance in the whole body, and that the Concoction in the Bowels and Veſſels is depraved; you may ſay the Patient is ſick of a Feaver; and thence by asking, you may learn and preſently pronounce that he is diſtempered with the Head-ach, Thirſt, Heat, queaſineſs of Stomach, want of ſleep, and by conſequence with other Symptoms.</p>
                           <p>It happens ſometimes, that the Urine declines from its natural ſtate, yet not to ſhew the diſtemper the Patient complains of, but either the cauſe of the diſeaſe, or the conſent of ſome other part with the diſtempered; as if any one ſhould complain of a cruel Head ach, or trembling of the Heart, and make a watry Urine, that doth not denote thoſe diſtempers, but only a crudity in the Ventricle, and ſome obſtructions about the Spleen and Viſcera, which may be the cauſe of thoſe diſtempers: I ſay in this caſe, the urine being inſpected, the chief indications are taken about the Method of Curing, and we muſt not uſe Cephalick or Cardiack Remedies, but either Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharticks, which cauſe Vomit or Purging, or Openers, and eſpecially Chalybeats: But the urine is ſometimes vitiated, and yet its ſignification is wholly a ſtranger to the diſtemper the Patient complains of, as if any one were ſubject to the ſleepy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, or a Lethargy, and makes it red and full of preternatural contents, its inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſuggeſts chiefly coindications, <hi>viz.</hi> that we inſiſt not on too hot, but tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Remedies.</p>
                           <p>The chief uſe of Inſpection of Urines will be for the obſerving the ſtate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of every diſeaſe, as alſo the alterations towards health or death. For in Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical diſeaſes, by daily inſpecting the urine, is made known to the Phyſician, by what degrees the ſickneſs may increaſe day by day; at what time purging or altering Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies will be moſt fit, and what Medicines will be moſt profitable: hence is to be obſerved, whether Nature prevails on the diſeaſe or not; and a moſt certain Prognoſtication may be drawn from hence, either of the hope or danger of health; to wit, according as the ſigns of Concoction or Crudity appear in the Urines. In acute diſeaſes, hence the ſtate and height of the Feaver may be beſt known, at what time the Criſes may be expected, and with what ſucceſs; when it is beſt to inſiſt upon Evacuations, and when on Cordials. The Compaſs is not beheld with more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and diligence by the Mariner or Steers-man, than the appearances of Urines ought to be obſerved by the Phyſician for fit times and ways of Curing.</p>
                           <p>Theſe were what I had to had to ſay concerning the Judgments of Urine, not col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the vain Traditions of Quacks, but what are conſonant to reaſon and truth. Beſides I know there are ordinarily delivered by Medicaſters and Old women almoſt an innumerable company of Rules and Directions of Urine-divination, that the Urinal is no ſooner inſpected, but they will undertake to divine, whether it be a man or a woman that is ſick, how long they have been ſick, what their diſeaſe is, and whether the diſtemper ſhall end in health or death; whether the Patient be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the paſſions of Love or Sadneſs, whether a Woman hath conceived with Child or not, or whether it ſhall be a Boy or a Girl, and an hundred other the like; in which uſing a vain conjecture, they either impoſe by their confidence on the minds of the credulous, or (which is more frequently their cuſtom) by a cunning craftineſs they other ways ſift out the matter by inquiring, and falſly aſcribe it to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the inſpection of Urine.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Examination and various ways of proving of Urines.</head>
                           <p>ALthough the buſineſs of the Examination and Inſpection of Urines ſeems com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly only a ſimple thing (<hi>viz.</hi> the Medicaſters and Quacks for the moſt part behold the Urine ſent in a Glaſs, ſhake it a little, and preſently give Judgment) yet to thoſe who honeſtly endeavour the recovery of the ſick, the matter ſeems a little more intricate, and they uſe to obſerve ſeveral circumſtances concerning Judgment by Urine; which being omitted, nothing indeed can be certainly or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:152521:107"/>
learnt in the Medicinal Practice from the Urinal. Moreover, in ſome diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, beſides the mere inſpection of the Glaſs, there are other ways of tryal to be had, by which, what lies hid in the Urines, and out of ſight, may be made clear: from whence ſome not unprofitably taking care of the ſeparation of Urine more accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, have uſed to evaporate, diſtil, putrifie, and precipitate them. Wherefore we ſhall ſpeak briefly of the right manner of inſpecting Urine, and in ſome caſes of the Analyſis or ſeparation variouſly to be inſtituted.</p>
                           <p>When the Urine of the Patient is offered to the Phyſician, if it hath firſt ſtood for ſome time in the Glaſs, and if the liquor be clear, the Hypoſtaſis as it were gathered into a little cloud, and if the reſt of the contents ſink down to the bottom, there is nothing more wanting, but that forthwith a prognoſtick ſentence may be given. But if the Urine be newly poured into the Urinal, or be troubled by a former ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, you muſt ſtay till the confuſed parts be ſeparated, and the ſettlement have acquired its due place. If the Liquor be full of contents, and the Pores ſtraitned, it becomes troubled and dark, and the Glaſs muſt be put in a warm place, till the urine grow clear again, and then let it be placed for ſome time near the fire, that whilſt the preternatural of more thin contents are abſorpt by the Pores dilated by the heat, the more thick may fall down to the bottom, and the filaments or little rags making the Hypoſtaſis, (if there be any) may be gathered together below, or in the middle region; for ſo will appear what is the power of Nature, and what of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe: Alſo in Feavers, the degree of heat and efferveſcency, the concoction or depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the nutritious Juyce, alſo the congeſtion or heaping together of the aduſt matter in the blood, and its ſeparation begun, or wholly fruſtrated, may ſomewhat appear by the ſignification taken from Urines; wherefore you ought to proceed after this manner, when the urine is brought from far, to wit, whoſe Particles are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed by much ſhaking, unleſs it be kept for ſome time in a warm place, they will not eaſily get again their due place of poſition. But if you often viſit any Patient that keeps his bed, it will be convenient, that the urine newly made, and put into an Urinal, be placed near a Stove, where, whilſt it grows moderately hot, the ſeveral parts may, after the beſt manner, be diſpoſed to a ſettlement without any trouble or diſturbance.</p>
                           <p>Afterwards the Urine thus naked, and as it were diſrobed from any covering, is offered to the ſight, the next caution will be, leſt any of its Phenomena or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances being accidentally contracted, and not properly belonging to it, may impoſe upon the Phyſician: which indeed ſometimes happens, by reaſon of alterations cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in them by food taken, and which chiefly conſiſt in the colour and ſmell of urines, being variouſly changed beſides Nature, and the expectation of the Phyſician.</p>
                           <p>For it is an errour commonly committed, when the Urine being yellow, and tinging the linen by the taking of Rhubarb, Saffron, Sanders, and the like, undoubtedly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it a ſign of the Jaundice; alſo the urine being imbued with blackneſs by the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Caſſia, to attribute it to the melancholick Tumor or black Bile; alſo when the urine is deep colour'd by taking of Pulſe-broth, or a Decoction of Madder, or other drinks, we falſly ſuppoſe it to indicate a feaveriſh intemperance. It often happens from the drinking plentfully thin liquor, the urine is leſſened of its high colour beyond expectation, and heightned by the drinking of ſtrong drink or hotter things: unleſs the Phyſician take notice of theſe kinds of mutations, he will give but a falſe Judgment concerning Urines by looking on them. When therefore the colour is changed in the urines without any manifeſt cauſe, the manner of living muſt be inquired into, if that the alteration proceeds from what is eaten or drunk, that it may not be wrongfully aſcribed to the diſeaſe. A queſtion will here ariſe, why foraſmuch as moſt things taken in at the mouth, before they go into urine, wholly loſe all their colour; yet ſome others, which being eaten, ſo pertinaciouſly impreſs a tincture to the Serum, that they paſs untouched through all the ſtrait turnings and windings of the paſſages? The reaſon or cauſe of which conſiſts chiefly in this, that ſome mixtures have the conſtitutive parts of their colour or dye very ſubtil, and thoſe highly volatile; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe being taken only in a ſmall quantity, dye the whole maſs of the Chyle with their colour; and from thence the nutritious Juyce conveyed to the blood, aſcends co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, and its vehicle, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſerous Latex, is ſent away ſtill dyed or tinctured.</p>
                           <p>What the odour of Urines of ſound people may be, is obvious to every one that can ſmell, <hi>viz.</hi> whilſt it is freſh made, it is not very ungrateful, by reaſon of the ſulphureous and ſaline Particles bound up in the ſubſtance of the liquor; when it hath
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:152521:108"/>
ſtood ſo long, that the Sulphur begins to exhale, ſharpned with the Salt, the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being looſned, it putrifies and ſtinks grievouſly. Beſides we may obſerve, that ſometimes there ariſes from urines freſh made, a ſweet odour like Violets, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they offend the noſe with a very ungrateful ſtink. The former doth not depend either on an healthful or unhealthful condition of the body, but is produced only from things taken: Turpentine, Nutmeg, and other Gumms and Spices taken in at the mouth, though of a diverſe nature and operation, impart a like ſuavity or ſweetneſs to the urine. The reaſon of this ſeems to be, becauſe in theſe kind of mixtures very many particles of the purer Sulphur (that is imbued with Spirits) are eminent; which, for that they are volatile, being confuſed with the Serum, are not contained in the bond of the mixture: wherefore the urine being made, theſe alone leap out, and not accompanied with others of the ſtinking urine, and ſo diffuſe a grateful odour; which, although it proceeds from divers kind of things eaten, yet remains ſtill after the ſame manner like Violets, for that in all, thoſe ſulphureous Particles are ſet free by digeſtion from the others joyned with them in the ſame concrete, nor are infected by different ones from the urine. But as to what reſpects the ſtinking urine, that ſometimes proceeds from an Ulcer about the Reins, Bladder, or urinary paſſages; ſometimes alſo it is raiſed from a too hot intemperance of the Reins, or of the whole Body: for when the Sulphur is deeply boiled in the Serum, its particles being ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Salines, (for that they are leſs cloſely ſhut up) do preſently evaporate, and grievouſly affect the ſenſe of ſmelling; but beſides, ſometimes urines contract a ſtink from things eaten. For the Balſam of Sulphur, Garlick, Aſparagus, Cider, Rheniſh Wine, and many other things taken at the mouth, do cauſe a ſtrong ſmell in the urine. If the reaſon of this be demanded, we ſay that ſuch things which impart a ſtink to the urine, alſo provoke it in a more plentiful quantity: wherefore it ſeems that theſe ſort of things being taken, fuſe the blood, and greatly haſten the precipitation of the Serum: and when by this means the ſerous Juyce is pulled away as it were abruptly from the blood, the frame of the liquor is made lax, nor are its parts exactly mixed, nor contained in an equal bond of diſpoſition: wherefore when this urine is made from the body, its frame or ſubſtance being before looſned, the particles of the more groſs Sulphur (that is combined with Salt) preſently breathe out, and ſo diffuſe a ſtinking ſmell. For urine thus altered by things taken, ſeems very like to Lye, wherein Antimony or common Sulphur is boiled, and is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards inſtilled into ſome acid thing, becauſe in this Decoction, as alſo in ſuch urine, the frame of the liquor being unlocked, the little ſulphureous bodies leap out, and affect the ſenſory with a ſtinking ſmell.</p>
                           <p>If that any one more curious in the ſearch of Urines, ſhall ſeek further than the examination of the ſight and ſmell, he may eaſily, by a divers manual operation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve them into parts, and as it were diſſect them to the life, and thence draw Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal directions of no ſmall moment; for that in many Chronical diſeaſes where the Dyſcraſies of the blood are more exactly to be ſought into, that the proportion and temperature of Salt and Sulphur may be truly found in it, it is ſometimes convenient to evaporate urines, or to diſtil them; ſomething alſo is to be learned from them, being precipitated, or looſned by putrefaction. I knew an honeſt Woman greatly afflicted with a ſcaly filthineſs of the skin, which ſhe was daily wont to ſcratch off in great plenty, as it were a branny matter. Her urine being evaporated in a little Skillet, leſt ſticking to the ſides of the Veſſel, a cruſty and ſalt ſediment, like the excrement of her skin. Not long ſince I evaporated the urine of a Gentleman, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly ſubject to convulſive motions and painful ſtretchings out of the Muſcles, in the bottom of which there remained a quantity of ſalt and tartarous matter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the weight of half the liquor. By this means it will be an eaſie thing to find the proportion of the ſaline Principle in the blood and humours: but whether this Salt be volatile, or becomes fixed beyond meaſure, the diſtillation of the urine will preſently ſhew: For if the Spirit (ſo called) be copiouſly drawn out of the urine, and that beſides the Salt aſcends into the Alembeck, it is a ſign of volatilization: but the contrary to this argues the fixity of the Salt.</p>
                           <p>As the evaporation and diſtillation of the Urine ſhew the power of the ſaline Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, ſo the precipitation, putrefaction, and Sulphur lay open the thicker contents of the Urine, as it were in weight and meaſure. As to the former, although the liquor of the urine be ſalt, and often big with contents, yet for as much as its ſaline Particles are not (as it is wont to be in moſt Menſtruums) either wholly in a ſtate of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:152521:108"/>
fixity, or of flux, but for the moſt part volatile, therefore it is not eaſily nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently by any ſalt infuſion ſubject to putrefaction; the Spirit of Vitriol and other acetous things effect nothing: the Salt of Tartar ſtirs up a little perturbation. But the ſolution of Alum, for that it greatly conſtrains into a little ſpace, preſently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs the whole liquor extremely, and delivers all the contents of the urines, as they were thruſt out of their dens, to be ſeen openly by the eyes. Wherefore by this means, without any long ſtay for ſettlement, you may preſently know how much of ſulphureous and earthy matter is depoſed from the maſs of blood for recrements in the bottom.</p>
                           <p>The putrefaction of Urines is wont to exhibit the ſeveral particles of every kind, yet more diſtinct, and diſpoſed as it were by themſelves; for if the urine be left to ſtand unmoved for many days in the Glaſs, the colour, odour, and conſiſtency will be very much altered, for the colour will be deeper, the ſmell ungrateful, and highly ſtinking, the conſiſtency thicker, and will have on the ſuperficies a downineſs or hoarineſs, ſometimes whitiſh, ſometimes bluiſh; there will be alſo fixed in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Veſſel a thick and copious ſediment, and often on the ſides a ſandy or tartareous cruſt, of a whitiſh or Aſh-colour. From theſe kind of appearances, and as the urines ſooner or later putrifie, and ſo are more or leſs altered from their former ſtate, it may be conjectured what the proportion of Salt or Sulphur may be, whether of them exceeds the other: alſo no unfaithful Judgment of the quality and plenty of the earthy matter or the contents may be taken from hence.</p>
                           <p>And thus, Sir, at length you have the Doctrine or Method of Separation of Urine, ſuch as our unskilfulneſs hath rendred it: I deſire you would be pleaſed not only to pardon the errours and barrenneſs of this Diſcourſe, but alſo to excuſe it in other things, becauſe at firſt writ by your perſwaſion, and then by your command and requeſt made publick. Wherefore pray take care of this child hardly brought forth and almoſt an abortive, and as it were expoſed and deſervedly laid at your door, without portion. Farewel.</p>

                              <hi>The firſt Medical and Phyſical DISCOURSE.</hi> Of the growing hot or inkindling of the Blood.</head>
                           <p>IT is long ſince I deſigned to print my Meditations concerning the remaining Pathology of the Brain and Nervous ſtock: But when many Diſeaſes of that kind affect the animal Spirits, and not rarely the whole Hypoſtaſis of the corporeal Soul more immediately than the Humors or ſolid Parts; I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought it neceſſary firſt to publiſh the Diſquiſitions of the nature of this Soul, and its manner of ſubſiſting, and alſo of its Parts and Powers, that from theſe things rightly known, its preternatural Paſſions may at length be the better diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. But concerning theſe very hard matters, and difficult to be unfolded, when I had begun to frame (as I think) probable and rational Arguments, I ſaw well that they would be looked upon and laughed at by ſome as unuſual things and Paradoxes; which indeed it becomes me not to take ill, but to let every one freely to enjoy his own ſenſe, and to uſe in all things his own opinion and judgment. Among the many things conjecturally propoſed by me, (which I could not avoid) two chief Arguments are oppoſed, to wit, that I had affirmed, that the blood for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing of life was inkindled, and that the animal Spirits, for the motive act, were exploded: which terms, though perhaps they may ſound rough and ſtrange to be applied to the animal oeconomy; yet if any one ſhall weigh the Reaſons and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which do perſwade to the truth of either opinion, I doubt not, but that there will be none who will not give their aſſent, or eaſily pardon me for mine. In the firſt place therefore, becauſe there are ſo many opinions concerning the growing hot of the Blood, for that ſome attribute it to an innate heat, others to a flame in the Heart, ſome alſo to a fermentation of the bloody maſs, and others to its inkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; therefore I ſhall endeavour more narrowly to introſpect the matter, and as much as I am able, to build upon a more certain Ratiocination, its genuine Cauſe, though very abſtruſe.</p>
                           <p>We have formerly diſcourſed concerning that Soul, which is common to the more perfect Beaſts, with that ſubordinate or more inferiour of Man, and have ſhewed it to be indeed Corporeal, and to conſiſt of two parts; the one of theſe root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the blood we called a Flame, and the other dwelling in the Brain and nervous ſtock, Light. As we ſhall here only treat of the former, I think it will be no difficult matter to make uſe of the ſame Reaſons and Inſtances, which truly conclude, or at leaſt very like truth, that in the firſt place the blood is animate or hath life: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:152521:109"/>
that this Animation is in its accenſion or inkindling, or conſiſts in an affection moſt analogical to this.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Not only the opinions of Philoſophers, but the undoubted teſtimony of the Sacred Scripture plainly aſſerts the animation of the blood: to wit, the uſe of blood was forbidden in the Moſaical Law, for this reaſon, becauſe the Blood is the Life or Soul; which is alſo apparent by the obſervation of the moſt famous <hi>Harvey,</hi> for that its motion is to be obſerved by the eye, ſhews that it firſt lives and laſt dyes. For the greater proof of this, it is commonly known that Animals only live ſo long as the blood remains in its due plenty and motion; and that they preſently dye, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too great a quantity of this be taken away, or its motion ſuppreſſed.</p>
                           <p>But as to the ſecond Propoſition, to wit, that the life or ſoul of the fervent blood depends upon its inkindling; this will appear probable, if I ſhall ſhew: Firſt, that the liquor of the blood ought to be very hot in the more perfect living Creatures. Secondly, that this growing hot can be produced or conſerved in the blood by no other means beſides accenſion or inkindling. Thirdly, that ſome chief affections, as it were proper paſſions of fire and flame, are agreeable to the life only of the blood growing hot. Fourthly and laſtly, theſe being clearly ſhewn, ſome other leſs ſignal accidents and properties, in which common flame and life agree, are added, and alſo we will unfold how and in what reſpect they differ among themſelves.</p>
                           <p>As to the firſt we affirm, that the blood is perpetually moved in all living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; beſides in the more perfect it doth eſtuate or grow hot in act. Indeed its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcontinued motion is required, both for the conſervation of the diſpoſition of the blood it ſelf, whoſe liquor would otherwiſe be ſubject to ſtagnation and putrefaction, as alſo that being carried about in the whole body, it might be able to give a due tribute to all parts. For that the offices of the blood, at leaſt in the more perfect living Creatures, are divers and manifold, <hi>viz.</hi> to inſtil matter in the Brain and nervous ſtock for the animal Spirits to diſpenſe the nutritious Juyce into all the ſolid parts, to ſuggeſt to the motive parts an elaſtic Copula, and beſides to ſeparate all recrements and worn out Particles, and to put them aſide into convenient Emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories.</p>
                           <p>But although the mere motion of the Blood in leſs perfect Animals, or at leaſt its moderate ſwelling up, ſuch as may be perceived in Wine and other Liquors agitated into Fermentation, is able to ſuſtain and perform the oeconomy of Nature; to wit, for as much as both a crude nutriment is every where received from the river of the blood, though cool, continually flowing into all parts of the whole Body, and that fewer ſpirits and more thick, as it were ſeparated by percolation or ſtraining, enter the Brain and nervous ſtock with that plenty, that may ſuffice for local motion, and the Organs of the few ſenſes to be rudely actuated: yet the blood watering the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of more perfect Animals, require offices of a far more excellent kind; for it ought not only to be carried about with a continual and more rapid motion, but very much to ſwell up, yea actually to grow hot or effervent: to wit, for that end, that its frame or ſubſtance being very much looſned, it may more copiouſly ſend forth the reſpective Particles of various kinds, every where falling off from it, and may diſpoſe them here and there for the uſe and wants of Nature.</p>
                           <p>But firſt, for that the animal Spirits are continually to be ſupplied in great plenty from the maſs of blood, and that there is need for the elaſtic Particles requiſite for the locomotive function, to be thence perpetually poured into all the Muſcles, it ſeems very neceſſary that the liquor from whence theſe generous and manifold ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements are drawn ſhould be actually hot, or rather ſhould burn forth; to wit, that the aforeſaid Particles, not ſufficiently to be unlocked but by heat or burning, ſhould freely run out from the ſubſtance or frame of the liquor: which truly is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, becauſe from Wine, and alſo from the ſame bloody Liquor, and all other ſpirituous things, a ſubtil and ſpirituous humour is copiouſly drawn, but not to be performed by diſtillation without heat or fire. Yea the ſulphureous Particles, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are leſs apt to be exhaled from any Liquor, yet they moſt readily fly out by inkindling the ſubject. By theſe there is an apparent neceſſity of the blood's growing hot for the perfection of the animal as well as vital function; but that it may appear by what means this is done, to wit, whether by Accenſion, or by Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by any other way, we ſhall firſt in general inquire, by what means, and for what cauſes any liquid things are wont to grow hot; then we ſhall conſider, to which of theſe the growing hot of the blood ought to be attributed.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="26" facs="tcp:152521:110"/>Concerning theſe we ſay, that there are only three ways, or ſo many kinds of cauſes, by which Liquors conceive a heat, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, by fire or heat being put to them, as when water is made to ſeeth or boil over the fire, or that it grows hot by the heat of the Sun, a Bath, or Stove, or by the diſſolution of quick Lime; inſtances of all which are commonly known. For the ſame reaſon Bath-waters ſeem to boil. For, that we may inſtance in our own Baths, to wit, they are impregnated neither with Sulphur nor fixed Salt, as I have plainly experimented, by diſtilling and evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, and by pouring into them precipitating Liquors; yea by diſſolving them with Sulphur, and many other ways. They moſt reſemble Lime-water, and they, as we believe, grow hot from a like cauſe, to wit, by imbibing the fiery little bodies ſomewhere hid within the Earth. Of theſe, unleſs it had been ſuperfluous, we had here given a fuller deſcription, which may perhaps be done at ſome other time. Secondly, when ſaline Corroſives, which are of a diverſe kind, being mingled with themſelves, or with ſulphureous things, work mutually one on another with a great ſtrife and agitation of Particles, and oftentimes excite heat, yea ſometimes fume and flame; as when the Spirit and Butter of Antimony are poured to, or mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſtygian Water, wherein lixivial Salts are melted, or with Oyl of Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, or other diſtilled things; beſides when corroſive Liquors eat metallick Bodies, they often grow hot. Thirdly, and the only way beſides (as I ſuppoſe) whereby a liquid thing is made hot, is when any humour, being very much imbued with Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur or Spirit, conceives a burning by putting a flame to it, and ſo grows hot by burning forth. This is ordinarily ſeen in oily or very ſpirituous Liquors, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled and inflamed.</p>
                           <p>There remain indeed ſome other ways of Calefaction, to wit, Fermentation, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, and Attrition, whereby more thick Bodies, or Solids, often conceive a fervour, but they produce not ſuch an effect in Liquids: whilſt the mealy Maſs or Dough is fermented, the active Particles being ſtirred up into motion, unfold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on every ſide, and lift up the bulk or ſubſtance of the ſubject; in the mean time, for as much as the ſulphureous Particles being agitated with them, take hold one of another, and begin to be combined, a certain heat, though more remiſs, is excited; in like manner from Putrefaction, Dung or wet Hay get an heat, to wit, for as much as the ſulphureous Particles, within included, are very thickly heaped up together, then being combined together, they break out in troops: yet no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, either thin or thick, whether they ferment or putrifie, do for that reaſon at any time grow hot: For Wines, whilſt in fermenting they break in pieces the ſides of the Tun, or overflow the top of the Veſſel with a great noiſe and ebullition, do not actually grow hot, yea not ſo much as grow warm. The blood being let out of the Body, and placed in convenient Glaſſes, either to ferment or putrifie, doth not get any actual heat: yet in truth we grant the Blood in living Creatures to be fermented, and by fermenting to be putrified, yea and ſome other offices of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal oeconomy to perform the ſame: moreover, we have formerly ſhewed from its Fermentation being hindred, or too much increaſed, or otherwiſe depra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ed, divers kinds of diſeaſes to be produced: yet we deny the heat of the blood to be excited by Fermentation. Becauſe neither the blood of more frigid Animals, nor Wines, nor any other Liquors, though agitated with the higheſt Fermentation, are for that reaſon actually hot. And indeed the reaſon ſeems evident enough, to wit, becauſe the ſulphureous Particles being raiſed up in the more thick ſubjects, though they lay hold on one another mutually, and being more thickly heaped together, raiſe up heat: yet in Liquids, the ſame kind of Particles, however ſtirred up or agitated, are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately disjoyned by the watry coming between, and are hindred from their mutual embrace and combination; ſo that they cannot of themſelves produce an actual heat: For the ſame reaſon, hard Bodies being rubbed one againſt another, or violently knocked or bruiſed, do not only produce heat, but oftentimes fire; whenas yet Liquids, however ſhaken and agitated, do not grow warm. Therefore as there are only three ways, whereby actual heat may be begotten in all Liquors, we ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to which of theſe the heat of the Blood may be aſcribed.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, Some ſay it is the firſt way, from the opinion both of the Ancients, and of ſome of the Moderns: the Blood is ſaid to grow hot, by reaſon of ſome hot thing put to it, to wit, whilſt thoſe affirm an innate heat, and theſe a little flame to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Heart, and to heat the blood paſſing through it; but either of theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions eaſily fails, from which it is clear, that the Heart is a mere Muſcle, her doth
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:152521:110"/>
contain in it ſelf any tinder or matter for a flame or heat (I know not how) implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fit for their continuance. For though it be confeſſed, that on the continual motion of this Bowel, (which is only animal) the Circulation of the Blood doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, yet the Heart borrows heat altogether from the blood, and not the blood from the Heart.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, As to what reſpects the ſecond way of making hot a liquid thing, to wit, whereby a great heat is excited by the mixing of ſaline Corroſives together, or alſo oily, or by corroding a metallick Body, I think there is none that will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly aſſert, that the blood grows hot from ſuch a cauſe; for that its liquor, in its natural ſtate, is always homogene, and although it be ſtuffed with plenty of Salt, it is however with that which is volatile gentle, and benign only: But there is not to be found, either in the Heart, or in any other place a ſaline or any otherwiſe heterogene Mine, whereby the bloody liquor, by working or corroding, may get or conceive an heat: to wit, it behoves either ſuch a Mine or the Body to be corroded, to be perpetually renewed, becauſe the ebullition and heat raiſed up by the ſtrife of Salts, ceaſes as ſoon as the Salts are combined, or the Body corroded. If at any time the ſaline Particles of the humours in our Body depart from their right temper, and become enormous and unbridled, for that reaſon the blood, as to heat and motion, enters into ſome irregularities; yet it ſeems impoſſible, that it ſhould originally and perpetually become hot by the congreſſion, and ſtrife, or corroſion of the Salts.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, As to the third way, whereby Liquids are made hot, though it may ſeem an uncouth ſaying, That the blood is ſo inkindled, yet ſince we cannot attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to any other way beſides, what ſhould hinder from attributing its heat to this Cauſe? And the rather, for that the proper paſſions of Fire and Flame are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the life of the Blood alone.</p>
                           <p>For indeed theſe three things are chiefly and principally Eſſentials, requiſite for the perpetuating flame. Firſt, that there be granted to it, aſſoon as it is inkindled, a free and continued acceſſion of the Air. Secondly, that it may enjoy a conſtant ſulphureous food. Thirdly, that its recrements both ſooty, as alſo the more thick, be always ſent away. So then if I ſhall ſhew theſe things to agree after the ſame manner with life, as flame, and to thoſe only, without doubt, I think that life it ſelf may be eſteemed a certain kind of Flame.</p>
                           <p>In the firſt place therefore, that a flame may be inkindled, and remain inkindled, there is need of a free and undiſcontinued acceſs of Air, and that not only, that the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous Effluvia's, threatning the ſuffocation of the flame, may be carried away, and always depart, but much rather, that the nitrous food neceſſarily requiſite for the burning of any thing, may be ſupplied by the Air. For indeed every ſublunary fire, and eſpecially flame, is compounded or made up altogether of ſulphureous Particles, breaking out in heaps from a combuſtible Body, and of nitrous Bodies, which every where flow in the Air, meeting with them: when Particles of Sulphur, breaking out ſlowly or interruptedly, get to themſelves a few nitrous, only planted near them, a fire is uſually produced, ſuch as is ſeen in a burning Coal: But when the former going away more impetuouſly, either of their own accord, or forced by blowing, preſently lay hold on very many nitrous Particles flowing round about in the whole circuit, a flame ariſes. In truth the whole region of the Air is abundantly ſtuffed with nitrous little bodies, which are every where ready for the conſtituting of fire and flame, and they being any where inkindled, meet them after the manner of a ſtood, although not always after the like manner or meaſure, becauſe it is obſerved at ſome times, eſpecially in the Winter-cold, when the Air abounds more in Nitre, that fire or flame doth more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently burn, and diffuſe farther its heat: on the contrary, in rainy weather, as alſo when the beams of the Sun ſhine upon the fire, and ſo diſſipate the Nitre of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Air, the fire is ſo dull'd, as is commonly ſaid, that it is extinguiſhed by the Sun. If at any time the nitrous Particles of the Air are excluded from the ſulphureous of any ſubject breaking out in the inkindling or burning, the fire and flame quickly periſh; which appears, becauſe this or that being put into a Glaſs, after the Air is ſucked out or excluded, they preſently expire. Further, in the open Air, although a naked fire propagates a fire in a fireable matter by mere contact, yet a flame is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inkindled without a flame be put to it, or a very ſtrong fire: becauſe, for the ſtirring up of a flame very many nitrous Particles of the Air, implanted round about, ought to be inkindled at once; as if Nitre and common Sulphur being pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:152521:111"/>
together, be commixed (becauſe both incentives agree) even the leaſt ſpark falling into ſuch a mixture begets an highly impetuous flame, which deſiring no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a nitrous food, is inkindled or burns under water, in a place void of air, or in any place as freely as in the open air. In like manner the leaſt ſulphureous things, as a bit of ponderous wood, being caſt into a red-hot Crucible, in which Nitre is fuſed, the ſame at firſt touch preſently conceive a flame, and continue till it be wholly conſumed: But that fire and flame being included in a place empty of air, expire by reaſon of the food of Nitre being drawn away, rather than choaked by their own proper ſmoke,<note place="margin">Exper. Phyſ. Mec. <hi>50.</hi>
                              </note> the Illuſtrious Mr. <hi>Robert Boyle</hi> hath moſt clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated by very many Experiments. For a Candle being lighted, and put into a capacious globe of Glaſs, and the Veſſel ſtopped up: aſſoon as the air was ſucked out by a wind-inſtrument, the flame did expire. Moreover he obſerved, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes for our Hypotheſis,<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Exper.</hi> 1.3.</note> that the flame contracted it ſelf according to all its dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, aſſoon as ever the Engine began to ſuck, then after the ſecond or third draught of the drawn forth air, the flame about the utmoſt extremities appeared very blue, and to go back more and more from the Tallow, till at length getting to the top of the ſnuff it expired: the ſame Candle being again lighted, and ſhut up in the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient, this worthy Gentleman tryed how long it was able to ſuſtain its light, when the air was not exhauſted, and he found it to endure much longer lighted than before. From theſe it clearly appears, that the flame ſhut up, expires not ſo much becauſe it is ſuffocated by its own proper ſmoke, as becauſe it is deſtitute of the nitrous food of the Air. For in the former Experiment the air being exhauſted, there was more ſpace for the ſmoke and fume, that the flame might not be ſtifled, and yet this dyed ſooner, the Recipient being empty, than the ſame being full of air; beſides, the flame dying became bluiſh, for as much as it participated of more Sulphur than Nitre; and it left the Tallow, and expired at the top of the ſnuff, for that it followed its moſt neceſſary food as far as it was able,<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Exper.</hi> 78.</note> to wit, the nitrous Particles of Air. The ſame Experiment ſucceeded alike in live Coals, <hi>viz.</hi> the naked fire, after the food of Nitre was drawn away, ſuddenly dyed. Here alſo it doth what the flame of a Candle doth in Mines or Caves under ground, where the nitrous air is wanting or diſpelled, at firſt it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more contracted and blue, and then a little after expires.</p>
                           <p>I have been more large in this Argument, becauſe there is for both the like neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of drawing in of the air, after the ſame manner, for the ſuſtaining the life of the Blood, and for the continuing of flame. For the more hot Animals, if they are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from reſpiration dye quickly, wherefore the ſame means of killing is moſt ready and common to ſhut up the breath, which being wholly obſtructed, life periſhes as a flame. If it ſhould be objected, that thoſe choaked do dye, becauſe the foot or ſmoke being retained, blow up and intumifie the bloody maſs, which for that reaſon, the bulk or ſubſtance being increaſed, and made almoſt immoveable, fills the boſom of the Heart, and hinders its motion: I ſay, that this is improbable, becauſe if the Arteries, every where in the Limbs and about the Neck, be ſtrained hard together with Ligatures, that the blood being ſtraitned as to the compaſs of its circuit, be very much ſtopped about the Praecordia, (more certainly than can happen from the mere retained ſmoke) yet for that cauſe death neither preſently follows, nor any deadly Symptoms. That this happens in thoſe that are hindred from reſpiration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the vital flame of the blood is wanting of the nitrous food of the Air, rather than overthrown by its proper ſoot or ſmoke being detained,<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Exper.</hi> 41.</note> the moſt Famous <hi>Boyl</hi> alſo by his Experiments hath put it out of doubt; for he hath obſerved, that hot living Creatures being put within a glaſſy Globe, and ſhut up, did far ſooner expire, the air being drawn away from them, than the ſame being left within it, though in the former caſe, there was more ſpace left for the receiving the ſmoke, left the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of it might conſtipate the blood: yet however, if the heat of the blood ſhould ariſe from Fermentation, or the congreſſion of diſſimilar Particles, or from an ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by reaſon of admitted heat, or from any other cauſe beſides accenſion, it is ſo far that that effect could be inhibited or ſuppreſſed by reaſon of the air being excluded, that on the contrary it would rather for that cauſe become more ſtrong or intenſe. For it appears, by a common obſervation, that Liquors chiefly fermentable, the more ſtrictly they are kept in the Veſſel, the more they grow hot, and the air being admitted through ſome vent-hole, they preſently ceaſe from their fury. Moreover, Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi>'s Experiments clearly ſhew, that the efferveſcencies or growing ſervent, ſtirred up by the ebullition of unlike Particles, or by corroſion, alſo the boiling up of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:152521:111"/>
hot water in a glaſſie Sphere, are above meaſure increaſed after the air is ſucked out, <hi>Experiment. Phyſicom.</hi> 41, 42, 43. That moſt ingenious Tract of the aforeſaid Author ſupplies us with many Experiments, whereby it is abundantly manifeſt, that the inteſtine motions of thoſe Particles, and almoſt of every thing, beſides fire and life, are very much heightned or made ſtrong in the ſpace emptied of air; but their act, preſently after the air is withdrawn, is extinguiſhed: hence we may conclude, the life of a living Creature to be either fire, or ſomething analogical to it. The like to theſe is yet more clearly obſerved by the diggers of Minerals, who ordinarily experiment in ſubterranean Caves, where either the Nitre is wanting, or is driven away by ſome ſtrange damp or vapour, ſo that they are in danger of being ſtifled or ſmothered, at the ſame time the flame of the Candle is diminiſhed, becomes blue, and at length expires.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond thing requiſite to ſuſtain a flame, is a conſtant ſupply of ſulphureous food, whereby it may continually be fed, which being ſubſtracted, or by reaſon of ſome incongruous mixture depraved, the flame is extinguiſhed; as is perceived in a Lamp, which for want of oyl, or water poured in its place, expires: further, as this ſulphureous food is more or leſs ſuggeſted, ſometimes more plentifully, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more ſparingly, the flame being more or leſs intenſe, is ſometimes produced clear, ſometimes ſmoaky; in the mean time, the food being conſtantly conſumed by burning, goes away partly into vaporous Effluvia's, and partly into aſhes, which are made up of ſome Particles of Earth, Salt, and Sulphur: But it is much otherwiſe in Liquors expoſed to Fermentation, to which if new Particles be continually admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, and the old ones depart, the Fermentation is hindred or diſturbed.</p>
                           <p>In like manner, as in Flame, the Blood of the hotter Animals (and this only in all natural things, beſides fire) requires a conſtant and copious ſulphureous food; and that being quickly worn, is for the moſt part conſumed in vaporous Effluvia's, a <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> being left of Earth, Salt, and ſtinking Sulphur: In the mean time from its food conſumed by burning, it diſpoſes other Particles for other uſes. That the life or flame of the blood doth continually want aliment, there is none but daily finds it in himſelf: For if that be for ſome time denied, the vigor of the blood is diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea and conſuming the ſolid parts, it ſnatches into its boſom their remnants, and other humours of the Body whereby it may be fed. If the nutriment daily ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted from things taken, be too thin and watry, the fervour of the blood, like flame without food, uſes to be remitted; but if the food be very ſulphureous and ſwelling with a vinous Spirit, and plentifully taken in, the blood is preſently infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and often breaks out into a Feaver, as it were an open burning. In the interim out of that food of the blood exhauſted or conſumed, as it ſeems by accenſion, hot Effluvia's full of ſoot and vapour go away, which according to a juſt account, far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all the other excrements of the Body; and that their nature is plainly fiery, the frequent burning of the mouth and tongue, and infecting them with blackneſs like the ſoot or ſmoke of a Chimney, witneſſes; beſides, from the inflamed blood aduſt Feces, like a <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> are ſent into the Bladder of the Gall, Spleen, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps into other Emunctories.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, That inkindled Flame may for ſome time continue, there is need of continual ventilation, to wit, that its ſooty Effluvia's may ſtill fly away, which elſe being detained and heaped together thereabouts, will ſuffocate the fire, becauſe by obſtructing the Pores of the inflamed Body, they hinder the eruption of the ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous matter to be inflamed. Although this condition doth often interfere with the other more potent, <hi>viz.</hi> the neceſſity of nitrous food to be ſo drawn in from the air, that it can ſcarce be diſtinguiſhed from it; yet we may plainly perceive, from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſoot gathered together about the ſnuff, the light to be put out: for which cauſe a Lamp, whoſe wick is made of plumous Alum or other incombuſtible matter, will not (as it promiſes) endure any long time, becauſe the ſoot ſticking to the wick, hinders the acceſs of the oyl to the flame; for this reaſon blaſts of wind from the Air wiping away the ſootineſs, doth not only render the flame more clear, that is free from fume and thick vapour; but food being ſufficiently given to it, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more durable.</p>
                           <p>Even as Flame, the life of the Blood requires alſo continual ventilation; to which end, beſides the greater breathing places of the Breaſt, innumerable leſſer, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pores of the skin gaping every where through the whole Body, do ſend forth Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via's departing plentifully from the boiling blood; which if it happens to be hindred,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:152521:112"/>
or too cloſely ſhut up, the blood will grow exceſſively hot, being as it were beſet with fume and vapour: beſides, there is need to ſhorten its circuit, that paſſing through the Lungs with a more frequent turn, it might there, as much as it can, diſpel all its ſoot or ſmoak. When the Heavens are heated, the Air ſeems as it were immoveable and to ſtagnate, we are wont very much to eſtuate or grow hot about the Praecordia; for that the blood being fed with a more ſparing nitrous food, doth not burn ſo clearly, but glows with a more ſuffocating and intrinſick burning: fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that the Particles of the Air being leſs nimble, when they are inſpired and expired or breathed forth, do not ſo readily convey away the vaporous Effluvia's of the blood; hence it is, that we fan the Air, that it may be made more moveable, and carry away more quickly and plentifully the ſoot or ſmoke from our Praecordia.</p>
                           <p>There yet remain ſome other ſmaller Conſiderations of Fire and Flame, reſpecting indeed not ſo much the Eſſence, as the production and extinction of either, which, whether and how far they may agree with the life of the Blood, we ſhall briefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into.</p>
                           <p>Fire or Flame is produced two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> either it is kindled from another fire or flame, or begot by an inteſtine motion of ſulphureous Particles. We have largely ſhewed the Species of either, and the manner of their being made, in our Tract of Fermentation (only we omitted there, that the acceſſion of nitrous food was neceſſary for the ſuſtaining it) even as flame, the life alſo of the hot or warm Blood, we have obſerved to be produced by a twofold way, to wit, it is either inkindled from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life or ſoul, as in Creatures that bring forth alive; or intrinſical Particles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed to animation, are at length raiſed up to life with the blood by a long cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of external heat, as in oviparous or egg-laying Creatures.</p>
                           <p>If it be further demanded, when and how the vital Flame is kindled firſt in the Blood? I ſay, ſome ſmall beginnings of it are laid up from the conception it ſelf in the Genital humour, to wit, when the rudiment of the bodily Soul culled out from the Souls of the Parents, as a little ſpark ſtricken from thoſe flames, is hid in a convenient matter; which being from thence raiſed up by the Mothers heat, begins a little to glow and ſhine, and afterwards being daily dilated with the blood brought forth, and leiſurely increaſed, is equally extended with the Body, which it actuates and animates. But yet as long as the young one is included in the Egg or Womb, the vital fire, getting very little or ſcarce any aery food, doth not yet break out into open flame, but like a Brands end covered over with aſhes, burns only ſlowly and very little, and ſpreads abroad ſcarce any heat; wherefore both the formation and increaſe of the Embryo depends very much on the Mothers heat, or the cheriſhment of ſome other analogical thing, whereof being deſtitute it periſhes: but as ſoon as the young one is born in due time, and begins to breathe, the vital fire preſently receiving the nitrous food, largely unfolds it ſelf, and an heat or efferveſcency being raiſed up through the whole bloody maſs, it inkindles a certain flame; and becauſe the blood then firſt ruſhing into the Lungs, having there gotten an acceſſion of Air, begins to burn, the fleſh of that Bowel, at firſt reddiſh, is ſhortly changed into a whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh colour, like burnt aſhes, and the blood it ſelf undergoes a notable alteration; for what did flow of a dark Purple colour into the Pneumonick Veſſels from the right ſide of the Heart, returning from thence preſently out of the Lungs, becomes Crimſon, and as it were of a flame-colour, and ſo ſhining, paſſes through the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart and the appending Arteries.</p>
                           <p>Indeed that in Creatures new-born, the colour of the Lungs is ſo ſuddenly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, I think it ought to be attributed to the blood, there at firſt more openly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled, and their fleſh as it were ſomewhat roaſted; although the mere inflation of the Lungs in a dead Embryo produces the like effect, becauſe the Membranes of the Lungs and the Parenchyma being diſtended and increaſed into a greater capacity, ſhake off the ſtagnating blood, and ſo draw it away into little and ſcarce to be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned rivulets.</p>
                           <p>As to the Colour of the Blood, ſo variouſly changed into circulating from a dark purple to a crimſon, and from this to that, I ſay, that the immediate cauſe of this is, the admixtion of the nitrous Air with the Blood; which certainly appears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the change into a crimſon, begins in that place where the blood chiefly gets the acceſs of the Air, <hi>viz.</hi> whilſt it is transferred out of the Arteries into the Pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monick Veins; for in thoſe it appears of a dark Purple, in theſe every where florid, as the moſt Learned Doctor <hi>Lower</hi> hath obſerved. Further, it yet farther appears,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:152521:112"/>
that this alteration of the colour proceeds from the admixture of the Air, becauſe that crimſon colour follows in the ſuperficies of all blood, let out of the Veſſels by reaſon of its meeting or mingling with air; and if the flowering or top be taken away, another preſently ariſes. Beſides, the blood being let out of a Vein, and very much ſtruck with a ſwitch or rod, it becomes crimſon through all: and in like manner the blood of living Creatures ſhines at firſt within the Pneumonick Veins, to wit, preſently after the influx of the air by the Wind-pipe; and from thence, by reaſon of the ſame Particles of inkindled air being yet retained, it paſſes through all the Arteries ſtill florid; in the mean time, from the Nitre of the Air mingled with the ſulphureous Particles, and burning with them, the blood being greatly rarified, and in truth expanded into flame, impetuouſly ſwells up within all the paſſages of the Pneumonick Vein and the great Artery, ſending from it ſelf copious breaths and hot Effluvia's; but being dilated towards the ends of the Arteries, and returning towards the Heart, that it may enter more cloſely into the little mouths of the Veins, it lays aſide its turgid and burning aery Particles, and being preſently made more quiet and half extinct, and ſo both its vigour and alſo its colour being changed, it returns through the paſſages of the Veins, that at length running into the Lungs, it might renew its burning. After this manner, that the inkindled blood might flame through the whole Body with a perpetual and equal flame, and ſucceſſively renew its burning in all its Particles, it ought to be carried about by a perpetual courſe from the neſt of its accenſion into all parts, and from theſe to that. For this end the Machine or Engine of the Heart was needful, as a Pin or Cock, which being made with a double boſom, might receive in it ſelf from the whole Lungs the blood freſh inkindled, that it might preſently drive forward, whilſt burning, into every part of the whole Body, and might then receive the burnt and half extinguiſhed blood returning from the whole Body; which being imbued with new inflammable juyce, it might deliver to the Lungs to be re-inkindled.</p>
                           <p>In performing this task, although the Heart be a mere Muſcle, and exerciſed only with an animal motion, ſeems to ſerve alone for the Circulation of the Blood; yet in the mean time, it ſo much helps to moderate the accenſion of the blood and its burning, according to the rage of the paſſions, and to direct other works and uſes of the animated Body, that we have thought the vital or flamy part of the Soul to have its chief, and as it were Imperial ſeat in the Heart and Lungs, in every diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or affection, as of Grief, Joy, Fear, and the like; alſo in the fits of Diſeaſes, the Heart is diſpoſed after a various manner, and hence it comes to paſs, that the blood flowing in fluctuates, and is inkindled with a diverſe rage; of which there will be a more opportune place of diſcourſing, when we ſhall treat of the Paſſions.</p>
                           <p>Whilſt we conſider that the burning of the Blood, and for that reaſon the vital or flamy part of the Corporeal Soul doth not appear lively or vigorous in all, nor ever after the ſame manner or meaſure; yet it exiſts according to the various conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the blood, to wit, as it is more or leſs ſulphureous, ſpirituous, ſaltiſh, or watry, yea and according to the divers conſtitutions and conformations both of the food, with which this flame is nouriſhed, as alſo of the little ſpiracles or breathing holes, by which it is eventilated; and further, of the Heart it ſelf, whereby it is agitated and driven about here and there; the accenſion of blood varies alſo in every one, by means of ſeveral other accidents, to wit, as its flame is ſometimes great, clear, and expanded, ſometimes ſmall, contracted, or cloudy, ſometimes equal and in order, ſometimes unequal and often interrupted, yea and it becomes ſubject to many other mutations; alſo becauſe the Soul it ſelf having gotten a various nature or diſpoſition, it conceives divers affections and manners, whereof we ſhall ſpeak here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; for as much as it is not a little thing, that the diſpoſition of the whole Soul depends upon the temperament of the bloody maſs, and the degree and manner of its accenſion or inkindling.</p>
                           <p>It clearly appears, from what hath been ſaid, that Fire and Life do dye or are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed alike many ways, to wit, there is an end of either, if the acceſs of nitrous food, or the departure of Effluvia's be hindred, or if the oily or ſulphureous aliment, requiſite to either, be conſumed, too much withdrawn, or perverted from its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable diſpoſition; of each whereof it is ſo clearly apparent, that there needs no farther explication.</p>
                           <p>Thus far we have ſhewn, that the Life of the Blood, or that part of the Soul grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein, is a certain kind of Flame; let us now ſee by what means it is diſpoſed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:152521:113"/>
to burning, and how near it comes to the ſimilitude of a burning Candle or Lamp.</p>
                           <p>A common Lamp, whether deſigned to give heat or light, for the moſt part is wont to be made after this manner; to wit, the Oyl flowing perpetually to the wick, gives continual food to the flame; wherefore as there is but one fire-place or hearth only of light and heat, the action of either is limited only to one place, and ſo as often as there is need of more places at once, or divers parts of the ſame ſpace or body to be illuminated or made warm, we place here and there divers lighted Candles or Lamps. But if an Inſtrument made with great artifice (ſuch as is truly an animated Body) with one liquor only contained in it, ſhould be made hot throughout the whole, and to be kept always warm, it ought not only to be lightly inkindled in the wick, but in the whole ſuperficies, and derived by fit Tubes or Pipes to all the parts of the Machine, then the burning liquor ought to enjoy, proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to all its parts, an acceſs of nitrous Air, and to lay aſide Effluvia's and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and ought alſo to have a ſupply of that conſtant expence: theſe kind of offices are not to be performed any where up and down, but only in ſome ſet places; therefore the burning liquor ought to be carried about through the whole with a perpetual turn, that all its portions might enjoy ſucceſſively all thoſe priviledges, and at once heat the whole capacity of the containing Machine, to wit, both the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward receſſes. Indeed ſuch a Bannian or Bathing Engine, artificially made, might aptly repreſent the real Divine handy-work of the Circulation of Blood, and what burns in it, the Life-lamp.</p>
                           <p>But it may be objected, that the Blood ſeems not to be inflammable of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; further, ſince there is no flame of this heat or effervency to be beheld with the eyes, it may well be doubted, whether there be ſuch a thing or no. I ſay firſt, That the Chymical Analyſis of the blood ſhews very many particles of Sulphur and of Spirit, yea a plentiful ſtock of inflammable Oyl, which are however mixed with other more thick Elements, in a juſt proportion, to bridle their too great inkindling; to wit, that this liquor might flame out by little and little, and only through fewer parts, for the conſtituting of a benign and gentle Lamp of life: wherefore the blood being let out of a Vein upon a burning fire, doth in ſome meaſure burn, though it is not like the Spirits of Wine, or Oyl of Turpentine turning all into a flame; beſides, the whole maſs of blood, as the Oyl of a Lamp, ought not to be fired; yea its bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is inſtituted for that end, that whilſt all the Particles of the Mixture being freed, ſome ſulphureous and ſpirituous are conſumed by burning, others more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til being ſent in Troops, might ſerve for the neceſſary uſes of the animal Regiment; and alſo others more thick or craſs and nouriſhing, as it were boiled or roaſted, might be diſpenſed for the cheriſhing all parts; beſides, that all the dead, or worn out, and excrementitious may be ſent away by fit or convenient ſinks, and others conſtantly ſubſtituted in their places by nouriſhment.</p>
                           <p>But in the interim, that the vital Flame, which deſtinated to ſo many offices, we ſuppoſe to be inkindled in the Blood, (otherwiſe than the common flame, which is plainly conſpicuous) appears not at all, a probable reaſon thereof may be given; as it is moſt thin, and burns in the Heart, and its depending Veſſels as it were ſhut up in Receptacles, it doth not clearly flame out, but perhaps remains in the form of ſmoke, or a vapour, or breath; yea, although the blood ſhould openly flame out, yet it might be ſo done, that its ſhining being moſt thin, may not be perceived by our ſight, as in the clear light of the day we cannot behold a glowing red hot Iron, nor ſhining ſparks, nor falſe fires, nor rotten wood, nor many other things ſhining by night; why then may not the vital fire, even thinner than they, quite eſcape our ſight? Although ſometimes hot living Creatures uſe to ſend forth a certain fire or flame only conſpicuous by night: For we have known in ſome endued with a hot and vaporous blood, when they have put off their inner garments at night going to bed near a fire or Candle, a very thin and ſhining flame to have ſhewn it ſelf, which hath poſſeſſed the whole inferiour region of the Body. The reaſon of which affection ſeems wholly the ſame, as when the evaporating fume of a Torch juſt put out is again inflamed by a light inkindling, and manifeſtly argues that another flame, the root of this extrinſick one, lyes hid within the Body. For this very cauſe it is, that from the Mains of Horſes, and the Skins of Cats, or other hot Animals being ſhaken, little ſparks as it were of fire leap out, and often flames, only conſpicuous in the dark, ariſe. Beſides, we here take notice in a burning Feaver, cauſed by immoderate drinking of Wine or ſtrong Waters, that the blood, as the flame of it is very much
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:152521:113"/>
increaſed, doth grow exceſſively hot, and ſuch are wont to emit dry breaths, and ſharp Effluvia's of heat, not like thoſe that proceed from fermenting or boiling Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, but only inflamed. That which ſome in Feavers have imagined to have ſeen or obſerved even burning fires and flame in the eyes, argues indeed that the flame of the blood is very ſtrong, and alſo that it penetrates the incloſure of the Brain. I knew a certain ingenious Man of a very hot brain, who affirmed, that after a very plentiful drinking of Wine, he was able in the darkeſt night to read clearly; from hence alſo may be collected, how the accenſion of the blood, like that of burning Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, is to be increaſed or made ſtronger, <hi>viz.</hi> by an agitation of the parts, and a more plentiful affuſion of ſulphureous food.</p>
                           <p>But that in the hot blood of living Creatures, the Properties, Affections, and many other accidents of Fire or Flame are found without the manifeſt form or ſpecies of it; what if we ſhould ſay the cauſe to be, for that the vital flame of the blood is ſubjugated, or made ſubordinate to another form, <hi>viz.</hi> to the corporeal Soul? Wherefore, although it retains the chief qualities and affections of common flame, yet it loſes the ſpecies of flame or fire; for in every natural mixture, the ſuperiour form exerciſes a Right and Dominion over all included Particles whatſoever, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fierce and untameable they may be in themſelves, and ſtripping them of their ſpecies, ordains and diſpoſes them to peculiar actions in that proper Concrete: when the form of fire excels, that bright burning, that it might propagate large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly its ends, deſtroys and conſumes all inflammable objects. But if the form of the corporeal Soul be induced upon the fire, kindled within the blood, it burns forth without fulgor or ſhining, or deſtruction of the ſubject, and is inviſible, and as it were ſubjugated flame, is ordained for the ſuſtaining of life and its offices: but truly the Divine Providence, from the very Creation of the World, hath ſeemed to have predeſtinated Forms to natural Bodies, to wit, that they might remain as ſo many Figures or Types, according to which every portion of matter framing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, whether animate or inanimate, might be modificated; ſo that the Maſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the virtues of the hidden Seeds, being diſpoſed after this or that manner, happens to have the form of a Stone, a Plant, or Brute, or of any other kind; then the acts and affections, appropriate to ſuch a Species, follow the form it ſelf. When therefore Life or Soul is deſtinated to theſe kind of Functions of the more perfect Animals, for the performing of which, the blood, after the manner of burning Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, ought to be perpetually hot, and as it were inkindled; what ſhould hinder, but that the act of Life, or of that corporeal Soul (conſiſting in the motion and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glomeration or heaping together of moſt ſubtil and agil Particles) may be called a certain Burning or perpetual Fire of the bloody Maſs? Wherein although the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and chief qualities of common fire are implanted, yet the form of fire is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, as being ſubjugated to a more noble form, <hi>viz.</hi> of the corporeal Soul: not much unlike water, which being congealed into Ice or Snow, lays aſide the ſpecies of water for a time, and may be applied to other uſes far diſtant from fluidity.</p>
                           <p>But truly, though we affirm, that the corporeal Soul doth ſtick in the Blood, yet we do not, that it is adequated or limited to it: becauſe whilſt the more thick portion of it, as the Roots of ſome Tree, fixed in the Earth, are ſowed in the bloody Maſs, the more noble part of the ſame Soul, as the higher branches, are expanded in the Brain and nervous Syſtem; or as we before hinted, when the vital or flamy part of the Soul is contained in the blood, the animal or lucid portion of it is contained in the Head and its Appendix; by which juſt limit the Sphere of either may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, neither may the vital flame impetuouſly break through the animal Region, the ſubſtance of the Brain being more cold, and alſo ſhining or bright, is oppoſed to it, as it were an icy or glaſſie Bar, whoſe interiour frame or ſubſtance, the ſmall and ſlender as it were rivers of the blood, for the ſake of cheriſhing heat, can enter: but truly ſpirituous Particles plentifully flow from its juyce or liquor, every where heaped up near the confines of the Brain, and there diſpoſed as it were to be ſtilled forth, which being immerſed in the Brain, and more exalted, affords matter, out of which the animal Spirits are procreated, to be derived through the Nerves into the various Regions of the Body.</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>AS there are two chief or primary Faculties of the Corporeal Soul, to wit, the Senſitive and Motive, we have aſſigned certain exteriour Powers of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, which are chiefly acted in the Nervous ſtock, and others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour, the Exerciſes of which lye within the Brain, to wit, ſuch as the Imagination, Memory, Appetite, &amp;c. What we have publickly diſcourſed of ſome time ſince both concerning internal and external Senſes, may perhaps hereafter be brought to light and made publick: in the mean time, becauſe I am oppoſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning both the natural and convulſive Motion, I think it fit at preſent to publiſh what I had meditated touching the Motive power, and what Hypotheſis I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of ſo hard and highly intricate a thing.</p>
                           <p>The motive Faculty of the bodily Soul is wont to be exerciſed with another kind of Action than the ſenſitive, <hi>viz.</hi> with a diverſe aſpect and tendency of animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. For that every Senſe is a certain paſſion, wherein the Soul, or ſome portion of it, being outwardly ſtruck, is forced to nod or ſhake, and a wavering of the Spirits being inwardly made to look back towards the Head; but on the contrary, every Motion is a certain Action wherein the Soul ſeems to exert it ſelf whole, or part of it ſelf, and by a declination or fluctuation of Spirits being made to bring forth a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis, and to extend ſomething as it were its member. Further, whilſt the Soul ſo exerts it ſelf, or ſome part of it ſelf, that the works then deſigned might be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, an heap of animal Spirits being every where diſpoſed in the motive parts, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one, ſometimes more are raiſed up by the Soul, which by that means being expanded with a certain force, and as it were exploded, they blow up the containing bodies, and ſo the ſame being increaſed as to their thickneſs, and made ſhort as to their length, are made to attract the adjoyning member, and ſtir up local motion.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. In every motion, theſe three things ought to be conſidered: <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, the original of the Action, or the firſt deſignation of the Motion to be performed, which is always in the Brain or Cerebel. Secondly, its inſtinct or tranſmiſſion of the thing begun to the motive parts, which is performed by the commerce of the Spirits lying within the Nerves. Thirdly, the motive force it ſelf, or exertion of the Spirits im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the moving parts, either into a contractive or elaſtick force. From this threefold Fountain, <hi>viz.</hi> as the buſineſs is performed in every one of theſe in a various manner, very many kinds and differences of Motions are deduced.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. As to the original or beginning of Motion, we ſhall take notice, that that which proceeds from the Brain, with a knowing and auſpicious appetite, may be called Spontaneous or Voluntary; but that which is wont to be excited from the Cerebel, where the Law of Nature preſides, ſuch as are Reſpiration, the Pulſe, with many others, may be called merely Natural, or Involuntary: either of theſe is either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, which is ſtirred up of it ſelf, or primarily from this or that beginning, as often as the appetite requires this or that thing, out of a certain proper, and as I may ſay, inteſtine deliberation, and chuſes out reſpective motions; ſo in like manner, when the ordinary offices of the natural and vital Function are performed, according to the ſolemn Rite of Nature; or the motion of either kind is reflected, to wit, which depending on a previous ſenſe more immediately, as an evident cauſe or occaſion, is preſently retorted; ſo a gentle titillation of the Skin cauſes a rubbing of it, and the more intenſe heats of the Praecordia ſtir up the Pulſe and Reſpiration.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. As to the Vehicle of the Inſtinct, which we ſuppoſe to be wholly done by the Nerves, for as much as it is performed by a ſingle Nerve, or by more at once, it is called either a Simple or Complicate Motion; then for that ſome Nerves help mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more or leſs than others by ſooner or later moving, this or that member is ſaid to be moved firſt, or by it ſelf, and another by conſent: yea, and that conſent is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:152521:114"/>
wont to be acted or done with neighbouring or more remote parts, and that with a diverſe reſpect: But we have in another place largely ſhewn inſtances of theſe kind of ſympathetick motions, as alſo the cauſes of each of them, and their manner of being made.</p>

There is another, and that a remarkable diſtinction of Motions, taken from the various conſtitution of the moving parts: to wit, parts endued with nervous Fibres, and in which the motive Spirits dwell; either they are Muſcles, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form local motions; or membranaceous bodies, the motions of which are terminated in themſelves, which therefore we call Inteſtine. As to what belongs to local mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which only we treat at preſent, although it be confeſſed by all, that the Brain or Cerebel, and the Nerves and Muſcles together one or more, as it were with joynt forces, do contribute to this motion; alſo, though it may be ſufficiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that the beginning of the motion to be performed is deſigned in the Brain or Cerebel, and that its inſtinct is conveyed wholly by the Nerves; yet by what means the Muſcles perform that work, far exceeding any mechanick virtue or operation, ſeems moſt hard to be made plain.</p>
                           <p>That local Motion is performed by traction, and doth depend upon the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Muſcle, is not only a vulgar Opinion, but is alſo plain by ocular demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; yet it is very much diſputed and variouſly controverted among Authors concerning the manner of Contraction and efficient Cauſe; ſome think it enough to ſay, that the Soul it ſelf, by its preſence, doth actuate the Muſcle, or contract or draw out here and there its Fibres, as it were a net ſpread forth. But indeed this is to attribute to the ſenſitive Soul a ſupernatural, and as it were Divine virtue. To wit, that the ſame, by its mere Spirit, was able to bend and force heavy and very great bodies whither it pleaſes. Further, for what end are the motive Organs fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with wonderful artifice and manifold difference, unleſs that after the manner of Machines, they might perform their operations by an orderly ſtructure, and as it were mechanical proviſion of parts? Truly it will be no hard thing to apply the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of a Muſcle and of the whole nervous Function, and to explicate them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Rules, Canons, and Laws of a Mechanick. Before I enter upon this, I think it not amiſs firſt to ſpeak ſomething of the make, conformation, and uſe of a Muſcle in general. The ancient Anatomiſts, almoſt all with one conſent, did divide the body of a Muſcle into Head, Belly, and Tail; taking for the Head the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Muſcle connexed to the part, to which contraction is made; for the Tail, the end or portion of the Muſcle inſerted to the part to be moved; for the Belly, the part of the Muſcle coming between, which is beheld more tumid, with a bulk of fleſh; then for the performing of motion, they did ſuppoſe the Muſcle to ſwell up about the Head and Belly, and ſo to grow ſhort as to its length, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract nearer to it ſelf the hanging part; yet by what means, and for what cauſe the belly of the Muſcle ſwells up, none yet hath clearly unfolded.</p>
                           <p>Moreover, although the Doctrine of the Nerves hath been much deſcribed by the moſt skilful Anatomiſts of every Age, ſo that the Muſcles of the whole Body (as it is thought) have been exactly recounted, and offices aſſigned them, and monſtrous names fitted for the expreſſing them, yet the true frame of a Muſcle, not yet ſhewed by others, firſt began to be delivered lately by the moſt ingenious Doctor <hi>Steno.</hi> He hath found out in every Muſcle two oppoſite Tendons, into which both the Fibres go; yea, and hath taught, that the ſame Fibres wholly, which compoſe ſtrictly on one ſide, the Tendon of the knitting being more looſly joyned, do conſtitute the fleſh; yet ſo, that ſome being laid upon others, compoſe the thickneſs or profundity of the Muſcle, and ſome laid nigh to others, its breadth or latitude: he calls the former Fibres <hi>Ordines</hi> or Orders, but the other <hi>Verſus</hi> or Turnings; then the parts and compoſition of a Muſcle being after this manner laid open, he aptly reduces its Figure to Mathematical Rules, and according to Canons thence taken, ſhews the action to be unfolded: becauſe he advertiſing, that in a Muſcle with a ſimple right line, all the fleſhy Fibres, parallel within themſelves, and for the moſt part equal, are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from one Tendon obliquely into another; and that thoſe Tendons are ſowed in the oppoſite ends or angles of the fleſh, whereby he moſt ingeniouſly deſcribes a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to be, <hi>a Collection of moving Fibres, ſo framed together, that the middle fleſh conſtitute an oblique angular Parallelopipedum, but the oppoſite Tendons compoſe two quadrangular Priſms or Figures.</hi> The Inſtrument which Painters uſe for the deſcribing many Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the ſame thing, fitly repreſents the figure of this delineated in a plain: becauſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:152521:115"/>
the ſtyles being fixed to the oppoſite Angles, expreſs the inſertions of the Tendons and the Parallelogram it ſelf the fleſhy part of the Muſcle: for when the oppoſite Angles are diduced to a great diſtance from one another, and made ſharper, the two ſides come nearer together, and render the <hi>Area</hi> or middle of the Figure longer, but narrower, a Muſcle not contracted is denoted: But if the ſame Angles are brought nearer, and made more obtuſe, the two ſides go farther apart, and ſo make the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Muſcle ſhorter, but alſo wider, a contracted Muſcle ſeems to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. In the mean time, in either ſite of the aforeſaid Parallelogram the quantity or longitude of the ſides is not changed, but only their poſition, and the largeneſs of the Angles is varied: whether it may be alſo ſo in a Muſcle, ſhall hereafter appear. In the mean time we ſhall take notice, out of the obſervation of the ſame moſt Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Steno,</hi> that a Muſcle is either ſimple, which conſiſts of one belly and two Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, of which ſort there are many in the Arm and Leg, which are the movers of the fingers and toes, yea and almoſt every where in other parts of the Body; or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, that hath many bellies, to every one of which, two oppoſite Tendons are hung; yet ſo, as when thoſe compounded Tendons, to wit, two together, ſhall be joyned, one compound Tendon enters the middle of the fleſh, and the other embraces the middle on both parts. This is evidently diſcerned in the Maſſeter or Throat-muſcle, the Deltoid, and divers others, in all which, even as in a ſimple Muſcle, whilſt the fleſhy Fibres (to which only the motive power belongs) are contracted, the oppoſite Angles are enlarged according to the inſertions of the Tendons, and ſo the bellies being made ſhorter, and at the ſame time thicker, do ſwell up.</p>
                           <p>In a ſimple Muſcle, according as one Tendon or both together, or either by turns, ought to be drawn; beſides, according as the part to be drawn is thin, or broad, or planted near or far off, and for ſeveral other reſpects the fleſhy belly is diverſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and as the Rhomboides is its chiefeſt regular figure, yet that alſo is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times triangular, ſometimes trapezial or quadrangular, pyramidal, ſpiral, ſemilunar or like an Half-moon, or of ſome other irregular form. But in all theſe kind of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the fleſhy Fibres, according to all their poſitions, whilſt they are contracted, at the ſame time intumifie or ſwell up, and are ſhortned from either end towards the middle, though in all Muſcles not always in a like manner and dimenſion; for if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tendon be to be drawn at once, the contraction from either fleſhy end, is for the moſt part equal; but at the ſame time, if one only be drawn from the others that are immoveable, the contraction is made leſs, and ſometimes, <hi>viz.</hi> where the fleſh immediately ſticks to the bone without any notable Tendon, almoſt none.</p>
                           <p>The compounded Muſcles are diſtinguiſhed with a far greater variety; for beſides their diverſity of figures, all which would be an immenſe labour to enumerate, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they are more or leſs compounded, or have their bellies more or fewer, with a manifold Series ſtretched out here and there, with Fibres ſometimes of the ſame, ſometimes of a divers order, they are very much differenced.</p>
                           <p>The more thin and leſs compounded Muſcle, when perhaps it is ſorted into two or three bellies, diſpoſed in the ſame being plain, hath the ſeries of fleſhy Fibres for the moſt part looking diverſly, all the exteriour Tendons embracing one end of the Muſcle, and hath the others intermediate or that come between immerſed about the other end; ſo that the ſeveral fleſhy Fibres of every Belly lye parallel between the one extreme Tendon and the other intermediate Tendon. The thicker and more compounded Muſcle, that it might perform at once quick, hard, and long motions, hath many bellies planted in divers plains, and the ſeries of fleſhy Fibres (which are all ſhort) looking many ways. The frame of them, although it be very intricate, that one can ſcarce number all the bellies, much leſs obſerve their habitudes, mutual depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and means of connexions among themſelves; yet they may in ſome ſort be reduced to this common Rule in moſt, to wit, in the great compounded Muſcles, ſuch as are thoſe round ones which contribute mighty ſtrength and elaſtick force to the middle of the Arms and Legs, we may take notice, in one end of two vaſt exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Tendons covering almoſt the whole ſuperficies of the Muſcle, which being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided preſently into many fiſſures or clefts, are ſtretched out between a broad ſhoot or claw to the other extremity of the Muſcle; then on the oppoſite ſide, about this other end, a great Tendon enters the middle of the fleſh, which alſo is cleft or divided pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently into many laps, diſtributed through the whole interiour belly of the Muſcle. And as theſe interiour lamens or laps meeting with the exteriour, and being ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out almoſt to the oppoſite end, look many ways, and have their ſuperficies turning
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:152521:115"/>
on every ſide, ſome every where are deſtinated to others oppoſite, and are committed or ſent through the intervenient ſeries of the fleſhy Fibres: ſuch a Muſcle, whoſe very many bellies being planted in divers plains, do look many ways, can by no manner or way be cleft or pulled aſunder, but that the other ſeries of fleſhy Fibres muſt be broke aſunder in the midſt. The bellies of a Muſcle, ſo very much compounded, although manifold, yet are very ſlender, ſo that the fleſhy Fibres thereof being moſt ſhort, and having their Angles always equal, but oblique, with the tendinous laps, for that cauſe make a moſt ſtrong attraction. Becauſe the numerous ſeries of fleſhy Fibres ſeem as it were ſo many diſtinct poſts or ſupporters ſet together for the moving of any weight, or rather, for that either great Tendon is preſently ſo cut into many lappets, it is like, as if a mighty draw-rope, hung for the drawing up a body, ſhould be preſently divided into many little ropes or cords, by which many men might draw at once. For whilſt the ſeveral ſeries of the fleſhy Fibres are ſhortned at once, they draw the oppoſite Angles of all the tendinous lappets together, and ſo the belly of the whole Muſcle being intumified or ſwelled up, they ſtrongly draw either end, or that which is moveable towards the middle.</p>
                           <p>On every Muſcle, both ſimple and compound, there is ſtretched on every ſide a membranaceous covering; beſides, other little Fibres tranſverſe, to wit, membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naceous, are woven between the direct moving fleſhy Fibres of every one, which clothe each of them, and keep or faſten them together, yea (as it ſeems probable) they both communicate to all the fleſhy Fibres the ſame inſtinct of obeying the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and alſo carry to the Tendons, the troops of the inflowing Spirits, received from the Nerve.</p>
                           <p>The Arteries and Veins, inſerted in the middle of every Muſcle, ſend forth little branches on all ſides, obliquely cutting the moving Fibres, from which leſſer bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches diſperſed between the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> of the fleſh, water them all with a flux or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of the blood. But the Nerve entring the fleſhy belly of every one, diſtributes ſome ſmaller circles only in the neighbouring parts, as it were bearing only the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol or mark of the commanded action, commands the execution of it to the Guard or inferiour Company of the fleſhy Fibres and membranaceous Fibrils.</p>
                           <p>I had deſigned Figures, almoſt of every kind of Muſcles, to be engraved accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the natural appearances: but the Printer making haſte, I had not the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to diſſect an humane Body, having only taken ſome few Muſcles from the Leg of an Ox, we have cauſed them to be delineated to the life, which are to be ſeen at the end, although the famous <hi>Steno</hi> hath already accurately performed this task. Which Figures, if any one think too much bending to Mathematical Rules, he may with an eaſie labour behold the ſame Conformation of a Muſcle, as he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it in the fleſh it ſelf. For if a ſimple regular Muſcle be cut out of any Animal, and ſo placed, that the Tendons here and there be held on the ſides, the fleſhy Fibres between them intercepted in oblique and equal Angles, be preſſed upon an Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal plain, the fleſh will be exactly like a Rhomboides or an oblique angular Parallelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipedum. Then if the ſite of the ſame Muſcle being changed, and its Tendons placed above and below, you ſhall cut long ways the inferiour Tendon, and pull the parts one from another, and divide by tearing the whole Muſcle into two parts, you ſhall preſently ſee a moſt elegant ſpectacle, all the fleſhy Fibres diſpoſed in one ſeries, yea and parallel between themſelves, and of the ſame longitude, to proceed from one Tendon into another, and to make both Angles always oblique and equal; although we cannot cleave after this manner the compounded Muſcles, whoſe manifold bellies have a diverſe plain, yet it will eaſily appear, to one curiouſly cutting them, either raw or boiled, two Tendons to be fitted to each Parallelogram of the fleſh.</p>
                           <p>As to what reſpects the action of a Muſcle, we plainly ſaw in diſſected living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, (which only ſhew this) that it is contracted, yet not ſo as the old Opinion declared, to wit, that the Fibres being contracted from the end towards the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, one extremity of the Muſcle was carried towards the other; but the fleſhy Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres only and their ends are ſeen to be contracted towards the middle, the Tendons being ſtill unchanged and altered neither as to their longitude or thickneſs: which thing alſo the moſt Learned <hi>Steno</hi> did firſt of all obſerve long ſince. This is clearly perceived in the Diaphragma and the Muſcles dedicated for Reſpiration, which are moved with a conſtant change: for as often as the Muſcle is contracted, you may behold all the fleſhy Fibres, in either extremity, to be pulled together at once, and as if they would enter on either ſide one another to be carried nearer, and ſo at once to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:152521:116"/>
become ſhorter and thicker, then from that conſtriction to return looſe to their wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed longitude and ſlenderneſs. Whilſt you behold this to be ſo done, you will eaſily think, that ſomething, to wit, ſpirit or ſubtil matter doth flow from the Tendons into the fleſh or fleſhy Fibres, which entring them on either ſide, blows them up, and at the ſame time draws them together nearer within themſelves, that preſently all the Fibres are made ſhorter and intumified; then when that matter recedes from the fleſh or fleſhy Fibres into the Tendons, the Fibres being emptied and looſned from their corrugation or wrinkling, are reſtored to their former longitude, and ſo by turns: whether this in truth be ſo done or no, ſhall be diſcourſed anon.</p>
                           <p>In the mean time, that we may proceed to other appearances of Muſculary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if that the Membrane of the Muſcle being drawn away, you ſhall ſeparate ſome fleſhy Fibres from others by cutting the little fibrils, whereby they are joyned, and looſen them quite, you will ſee them ſo ſingular and free, to be wrinkled or drawn together in every motion like the others compacted together.</p>
                           <p>Further, I advertiſe you, that theſe Fibres ſo looſned and freed, ſome cut off in one end, and ſeparated from the Tendon, did yet contract themſelves to the motion of the Muſcle, together with the other Fibres, about the other whole end, without that cut off in the mean time growing flaggy or looſe. After this I divided with a pair of Sciſſers, a certain fleſhy portion of the thinner Muſcle, in three or four pieces tranſverſe, the bigneſs of an inch: which being done, the portions cut off in either end, only entred into, for a ſhort ſpace, ſome light and inordinate corrugations, and preſently became immoveable. The other extreme portions of the Muſcle ſo cut, ſticking to the Tendons, continued to be much more lively and longer contracted, but irregularly and convulſively, to wit, with a certain intortion of the Fibres. Truly, in the Fibres ſo cut off, ſome ſmall footſteps of contraction did remain for a little while, partly by reaſon of the Inſtinct of Motion delivered through the membrana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous fibrils, by which they did yet cohere with the whole fleſh, and partly becauſe the animal Spirits, implanted in the fleſhy Fibres, now divided from the reſt, and left without influence, did exert or put forth their utmoſt contractive endeavours after the uſual manner. For this reaſon ſometimes in the Heart taken out, and in a piece of it cut off with a Sword, as alſo in other Muſcles, after the Nerves and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiferous Veſſels are cut off, a contraction and relaxation continue for ſome time. The other Fibres cut off only by reaſon of the acceſs and receſs of the Spirits from the Tendons, were able ſtill in ſome meaſure to be contracted and relaxed.</p>
                           <p>When in the Diaphragma I had freed many ſingular Fibres from the knittings of others, I tryed what Ligatures put in ſeveral places of them might effect. Some of them then being bound about the middle, were contracted even as the whole fibres, but with ſome little ſwelling about the Ligature. When I had bound others about the ends, where they cohere to the Tendons, now one, then another, the motion was chiefly and almoſt only continued about the free end. Further, in the fibres bound at both ends at once, the contraction wholly ceaſed.</p>
                           <p>Contraction and Relaxation are not only ſeen, and indeed probable, in the Heart, but in the Diaphragma and other Muſcles appointed for Reſpiration, which uſe to be performed in all, acting viciſſively, according to the Inſtincts of Nature, and for the moſt part equally (though there are not the like intervals of motions in all) yea, and the Muſcles ſerving to the voluntary function, enter oftentimes into ſpontaneous Contractions, unleſs they be hindred by their Antagoniſts, as it appears, for that the Spaſm or Cramp of one Muſcle comes upon the Palſie of another. Contraction and Relaxation are iterated more ſwiftly in the Heart, than in the Muſcles of Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſo perhaps in theſe, than in ſeveral others. In thoſe ready to dye, the fleſhy Pannicle every where trembling, clearly ſhews their changes by innumerable beatings or leapings.</p>
                           <p>As to what reſpects the Humors, whereby all the fibres of a Muſcle, <hi>viz.</hi> the fleſhy, tendinous, and membranaceous, and what lies between them, ſeem to be watered, filled, or blown up, we ought to take notice of them, at leaſt two of them, (to wit, the bloody and nervous liquor) if not more. And in the firſt place it is clearly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to the ſenſe, that the blood doth waſh all the fleſhy and membranaceous fibres which are interwoven with theſe: becauſe, if the Spirit of Wine, tinctured with Ink, be put into an Artery belonging to any Muſcle, the Vein in the mean time being tyed cloſe, the ſuperficies of all the fleſhy fibres and tranſverſe fibrils are dyed with black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Tendons being then ſcarcely at all changed in their colour; it appears from
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:152521:116"/>
hence, that the blood doth every where outwardly water all the fleſh or fleſhy fibres, and only thoſe. We have not yet found by any certain mark, whether the blood enters more deeply the fleſhy fibres, or inſtils into them the ſubtil liquor falling from them, although this laſt ſeems moſt probable; but indeed we affirm, that all the fibres, <hi>viz.</hi> the fleſhy, tendinous, and membranaceous, are perpetually and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully actuated by the implanted and inflowing animal Spirits, and conſtantly imbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the nervous liquor, which is the Vehicle of the Spirits. But how far, or how much the aforeſaid humors conduce to the exerciſe of the animal Faculties, doth not eaſily appear; but becauſe the animal Spirits cannot conſiſt without the nervous liquor, and depend very much upon its diſpoſition, we may conclude, that it doth ſerve ſomething to the actuating the motive power; for that reaſon alſo, that the continual afflux of the blood is nevertheleſs neceſſary, an Experiment cited by the Ingenious <hi>Steno,</hi> and proved of late by others, plainly confirms. He hath obſerved, that in a living Dog, the deſcending great Artery being tyed without any previous cutting off, the voluntary motion of all the poſterior parts have ceaſed, as often as he tyed the ſtring, and as often returned again as he looſned the knot.</p>
                           <p>Theſe are the chief Phaenomena to be obſerved concerning the frame and action of a Muſcle in the diſſection of Animals, both of ſuch as were living, as alſo of the dead and dying. From which, however placed together and compared among themſelves, how difficult a thing it is to conſtitute the Aetiology of the animal motive faculty, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears even from hence, that the moſt Ingenious <hi>Steno,</hi> after he had very accurately deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Elements of his Myology, by himſelf firſt invented, nevertheleſs he wholly avoided that Hypotheſis which might be founded out of them; for that he yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether the explication of a Muſcle by a Rectangle were convenient to Nature in all; wherefore when many run to the manner of muſculary Contraction, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of the fibres, and others from their inanition, and ſome to both, he inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly profeſſes, that the true cauſes of this thing do not clearly appear to him.</p>
                           <p>And as to this abſtruſe matter, although I do not believe that I am able to bring to light, or ſhew any thing more certainly than others; yet as in mechanical things, when any one would obſerve the motions of a Clock or Engine, he takes the Machine it ſelf to pieces to conſider the ſingular artifice, and doth not doubt but he will learn the cauſes and properties of the Phaenomenon, if not all, at leaſt the chief: In like manner, when it is brought before your eyes to behold and conſider the ſtructure and parts of a Muſcle, the conformations of the moving fibres, their geſts and alterations whilſt they are in motion, why is it that we ſhould deſpair to extricate the means or reaſons of the motive function, either by truths or by what is next to truth? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think it may be lawful for me here to bring before you our conceptions and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning this thing, indeed not raſhly taken, or to comply with our former Hypotheſis, or to oppoſe any other; which if they ſhall not ſatisfie all, may at leaſt excite others to find out better.</p>
                           <p>But we ſhall here repeat what we have mentioned before, <hi>viz.</hi> that the power or virtue by which a Muſcle is moved, proceeds from the Brain, is conveyed through the Nerves, and is performed by the fleſhy fibres contracted, and by that means abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated. This latter is proved by ocular demonſtration, yea it appears by it, that the motive force doth depend alſo upon thoſe former, and is ſo transferred by a long paſſage, that the influence of the Spirits being ſuppreſſed in their beginning, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the way, for that reaſon the exerciſe of the deſigned motion may be hindred. Further we notifie, that the motive force is far greater in the Muſcle, or in the end, than in the beginning or middle: becauſe the Brain and depending Nerves are made of a tender and fragil ſubſtance, and can pull or draw nothing ſtrongly; but the Muſcle putting forth ſtrongly its contractive force, ſeems almoſt to be equal to the ſtrength of a Poſt or Crow, or of a Pully or Windlace. Sometimes the local motion is a compound Action to be performed of many Organs, which conſiſt in divers places, and as its virtue is far more ſtrong in the end than in the beginning or way, we will inquire by what means, as it were mechanical, the motive force may be ſo augmented or multiplied in its progreſs, then what is brought to the motion from the ſeveral Organs.</p>
                           <p>As to the firſt, in Artificial things, when for the facilitating of motion, and the increaſing the moving force, many Inſtruments are invented, all of them, or at leaſt the chief, may be reduced to theſe two Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, either the ſame force or impreſſion may be continued, without the addition of any new force, from one term
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:152521:117"/>
or end to the other, or from the firſt mover to the thing moved, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding may be much increaſed in the way, as the Centers of Gravity are farther off or multiplied; for the farther the motion is begun from the firſt Center of Gravity, the ſtronger it proceeds, as is beheld in a Crow or Leaver, and in other things redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to a Leaver. Then if other things be diſpoſed beyond the firſt Center of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ſucceſſively before the end of the motion, as in a circular Wheel, the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive force is wont to be increaſed very much. But to this there is required, that the inſtruments of motion be ſufficiently ſtrong and tenacious in their whole tract; for otherwiſe the motive force being increaſed, the ſame breaking falls down before the deſigned action be performed. Secondly, there is another way of multiplying the motive force to a great degree, and alſo at a great diſtance, which is performed with the addition of new forces or of freſh ſupplies, to wit, when the elaſtick Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or thoſe making the force, being diſpoſed and ſhut up in private places, as it were little Cells, afterwards, as occaſion ſerves, are ſent forth by a light contact or blaſt of a remote Agent, into the liberty of motion, which they readily perform. By this means, Air compacted and ſhut up, when it is permitted to get out, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly forcing a Bullet or other object, ſends or drives it out a great way. It is ſufficiently known what mighty and often horrid forces Gun-powder yields about the end of the Exploſion, when in the beginning or firſt inkindling, the force being tranſmitted through the fiery fume, as yet weak, might be reſtrained by a light im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the hand. There are alſo other exploſive little bodies of a various kind, which being hid in convenient Boxes or Cells, when they are raiſed up into motion by an inkindling, or irritament, or provocative, do often exert an incredible force. It behoves us then to inquire from which of theſe ways it comes to paſs, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive force doth in the Muſcles ſo far exceed the force tranſmitted from the Brain through the Nerves, or whether the action of the Muſculary Motion be merely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive, or rather elaſtick, or in ſome meaſure exploſive?</p>
                           <p>Concerning theſe things it manifeſtly appears, that the Muſcles do draw, to wit, being abbreviated, do bring the Tendon with the hanging part towards it ſelf. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for as much as there is need for the offices of traction to be ſometimes more ſtrongly, ſometimes more weakly performed by them, ſo to have the Centers of Gravity now nigher, now farther off planted from the beginning of the motion; hence the Muſcles which extend or bend the Thigh, eſpecially the <hi>Pſoae</hi> and <hi>Glutaei</hi> (great Muſcles beginning in the Breaſt, and reaching into the Thigh) do hide their fleſhy moving fibres deeply within the Trunk of the Body: but thoſe which turn about the Thigh are conſtituted either near the hole or the riſing of the Bone of the Thigh, or ſomewhere thereabout; in like manner it is obſerved in all the reſt of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that the belly of the Muſcle gets a more remote or nearer ſite from the article or hinge of motion, as it deſigned for performing either a ſtronger or weaker motion: But truly this doth not hold as to the other moving parts, to wit, the Brain and Nerves, which cooperate with the Muſcles in the motive Act; becauſe, although the motive force is carried by a long paſſage through all theſe Organs, yet it ſeems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that a contraction ſo ſtrongly performed by a Muſcle, ſhould be begun by the tender and immoveable Brain, and continued through the ſmall and fragil Nerves, but that it muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed ſome motive Particles are hid in the Muſcle, which, as occaſion is given, are ſtirred up according to the Inſtinct, delivered by the Nerves from the Brain, into motion, as it were with a certain exploſion. But what theſe Particles may be, by what means they are inſtigated into motion, and how they induce the contraction of a Muſcle, ſeems moſt difficult to be unfolded.</p>
                           <p>Truly it may be lawfully concluded from the effect, that elaſtick Particles, and fit to move themſelves, are contained in the Muſcles, and hid every where within the fibres, becauſe the Anatomy of living Creatures diſcovers often a motion in a ſeparated Muſcle, yea in its fibres divided one from another. The Hearts of ſome Animals beat a long while being pulled out of the Body, the Muſcles cut off, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perform the motions of contraction. In great labouring Beaſts ſlain or dying, although the Heart and the Brain be taken out, the fleſhy Pannicle performs for ſome time very many turns of contractions and relaxations. From theſe it is manifeſtly clear, that there are among the Particles of the Muſcles ſome agil and ſelf forcers, or carried by their own force heaped together, which, although the animal oeconomy be very much diſturbed or overthrown, do enter into motion of their own accord, yet in a tranquil eſtate they perform no actions, unleſs commanded by the Brain or Cerebel, and delivered by the Nerves.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="41" facs="tcp:152521:117"/>Whilſt a Muſcle is contracted, the cutting up of a live Creature ſhews only the fleſhy fibres to run into motion by themſelves, to wit, being made more tumid, ſharper, and ſhorter at the ſame time, to amplifie or enlarge the belly of the Muſcle, and in the interim, the Tendons, as if immoveable of themſelves, to wit, not altered either as to their thickneſs or length, only pulled as it were by the fleſhy fibres, to be moved, and to draw with them the moved part; whence it ſeems to be manifeſt, that the animal Spirits or elaſtick Particles, which ſoever they are, whilſt they perform the Muſculary Motion, are only or chiefly agitated among the fleſhy fibres. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hence any one may ſtrongly think, that ſuch Particles are not at all contained, or are wholly idle in the tendinous fibres; for as we have noted, that the Tendon is not changed in the act, we may lawfully ſuſpect, that it is only inſtead of a Crook, by which means the fleſhy fibres being contracted, may draw the member to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at a diſtance from them towards themſelves.</p>
                           <p>But indeed it ſufficiently appears by evident ſigns, that the animal Spirits or elaſtick Particles do lodge within the tendinous fibres, and truly much more plentifully than in the fleſhy: Firſt, the ſenſe ſhews this, to wit, the touch, which is much ſharper and far more ſenſible in the Tendon than in the fleſh: yea any irritation or breach of the unity happening in that part, brings not only a moſt troubleſom ſenſe, to wit, a very cruel pain, but beſides, is wont to excite in the neighbouring fleſh a Tumor or Swelling, and frequently moſt grievous Convulſions; whence we neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the animal Spirits do inhabit the tendinous fibres in great abundance: but what they do there, and by what means they ſerve to the motive function, we will next inquire.</p>
                           <p>As often as the motion of a living Muſcle was beheld by me, I conſidered and weighed in my mind by what means all the fleſhy fibres were contracted and releaſed by turns, I could conceive or collect no other thing than that in every contraction, the Spirits or certain elaſtick Particles did ruſh into the fleſhy fibres from either Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and did intumifie and force them nearer towards themſelves or together; then the ſame Particles preſently coming back from the fleſh into the Tendons, the relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Muſcles happened. In a bare or naked Muſcle, when I had ſeparated every fleſhy fibre or a company of them apart from the reſt in the whole paſſage by help of a Microſcope, I moſt plainly perceived the Tumor, begun at either end of the fleſh, to be carried towards the middle, as it were by the Spirits, entred here and there at once. Further (which I mentioned before) each fibre being tyed about the middle, being as it were as yet free and compacted with the others, was contracted or drawn together; but a Ligature being put to both ends, it remained flaggy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly above or beyond the bound place. But that I might no longer doubt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, I applied two Ligatures, at equal diſtances from the middle and the ends, about the ſame bundle of fleſhy fibres, which being done, a contraction and ſwelling up ariſing preſently from either fleſhy extreme to the places bound, went no farther; the middle part between in the mean time being unmoved, remained flaccid; whence it may be well concluded, that in every muſculary contraction the animal Spirits or elaſtick Particles do leap out from the tendinous fibres into the fleſhy, and viciſſively in the relaxation, recede or run back from theſe into thoſe.</p>
                           <p>However this being proved and granted, there yet remain very many difficulties concerning Muſculary Motion; for firſt, it may be asked how the animal Spirits, which enter ſilently, or without any incitation, or Tumor, the tendinous fibres do ſo blow up the fleſhy fibres, that they are able to force them altogether into ſhorter ſpaces.</p>
                           <p>For the producing this effect, plenty of Spirits leaping from the tendinous fibres, do not ſeem alone ſufficient; but beſides, we may ſuppoſe ſome other kind of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, implanted in the fleſhy fibres, meeting with the others flowing from the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, do forthwith ſtrive, whence a mutual rarefaction, and turgeſcency or ſwelling up of them, or an inflation or ſudden blowing up of the containing bodies, together with an abbreviation or ſhortning of them, doth ariſe; not much unlike, as when the Corpuſcles or little bodies of fire entring into a piece of leather, or any thing, and forcing variouſly here and there its implanted Particles (whereby they are preſently inſnared) make it ſo to be ſtuffed and wrinkled; in like manner alſo the animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, although they paſs through the Tendons, where they are ſolitary or by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without moving them (as the Effluvia's of heat in Metals or more dry bodies) yet being dilated in the fleſh, for that there joyning with elaſtick Particles of another
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:152521:118"/>
kind, they are expanded or ſtretched out, they cauſe the ſudden inflations and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugations of the containing fibres. But we have elſewhere ſhewn, that ſuch Particles divers and wholly heterogene to the nature of the Spirits, may be copiouſly and eaſily carried to the Muſcles. For indeed it is plain by ocular demonſtration, that the blood doth every where waſh and water outwardly all the fleſhy fibres, which beſides, it is thought not only to nouriſh, but alſo to be buſied about the offices of the animal Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and what can be leſs ſuſpected, than that it doth inſtil into their Pipes a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſubtil liquor, whoſe Particles being agitated, and alſo rarified by the Spirits flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein, ſtuff up the fibres, (as we but now hinted) and compel them intumified, by reaſon of the aſſault on either ſide made, into ſhorter ſpaces?</p>
                           <p>But that the fleſhy belly of the Muſcle, whilſt it is contracted, doth ſwell up, is not at all to be doubted, becauſe this is evidently beheld by the ſight and touch in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of living Creatures: to wit, all the fleſhy fibres being wrinkled together, are made more tumid and ſharper, and ſo ſhorten the Muſcle, and make it alſo thicker and broader: For the more certain belief of this, when I had bound ſome of the fleſhy fibres, ſeparated from the knitting of the reſt, and had left others near them looſe, there appeared a notable difference between thoſe flaccid or not ſwelled, and theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumified or ſwelled up in every contraction of the Muſcle.</p>
                           <p>But if it be demanded, of what nature, to wit, whether ſpirituous ſaline, as may be believed, or of any other diſpoſition, the animal Spirits, derived from the Brain into the Muſcles, may be; and then whether the other Latex, immediately carried to them from the blood, is ſulphureous or nitrous. Concerning theſe, becauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not to the ſenſe, we ſhall pronounce nothing raſhly or poſitively. But even as in other natural things, the active Particles of a various kind, which being unlike among themſelves, are found apt mutually to grow hot, or to be ſtruck off from one another, or otherwiſe to be rarified or expanded; and as the inteſtine motions of Bodies, and eſpecially the elaſtick, ſuch as are the contractions of the Muſcles, can only proceed from the congreſſions of ſuch like, certainly it may be lawful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that theſe do wholly depend upon ſuch a cauſe.</p>
                           <p>Therefore as to the Muſculary Motion in general, we ſhall conclude after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with a ſufficiently probable conjecture, <hi>viz.</hi> that the animal Spirits being brought from the Head by the paſſage of the Nerves to every Muſcle, and (as it is very likely) received from the membranaceous fibrils, are carried by their paſſage into the tendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous fibres, and there they are plentifully laid up as in fit Store-houſes; which Spirits, as they are naturally nimble and elaſtick, where ever they may, and are permitted, expanding themſelves, leap into the fleſhy fibers; then the force being finiſhed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſinking down, they ſlide back into the Tendons, and ſo viciſſively. But whilſt the ſame animal Spirits, at the inſtinct given for the performing of motion, do leap out of the tendinous fibers into the fleſhy, they meet there with active Particles of another nature, ſupplied from the blood, and preſently they grow mutually hot; ſo that by the ſtrife and agitation of both, the fleſhy fibres, for that they are lax and porous, are ſtuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and driven into wrinklings, from all which being at once wrinkled or ſhrivell'd up, the contraction of the whole Muſcle proceeds; the contraction being finiſhed, the ſincere or clear Spirits, which reſide or are aſſwaged, go back for the moſt part into the tendinous fibres, the other Particles being left within the fleſh; the loſs or waſting of theſe the blood ſupplies, as the Nerves do thoſe. By what inſtinct the muſculary contraction begins and ends, ſhall be inquired into preſently.</p>
                           <p>That the animal Spirits, flowing from the tendinous Fibres, may enter equally all the fleſhy, there are two Tendons in every ſimple Muſcle, which are ſo conſtituted, according to oppoſite Angles, that the Spirits running to them from a twofold ſtarting place or bound, might preſently fill the whole belly of the Muſcle, and that motion being finiſhed, might immediately ſwiftly retire. If the contraction ought to be performed indifferently towards the middle of the fleſh, the Tendons for the moſt part are equal; but if the motion inclines more towards one region of the fleſh, one Tendon (to wit, which may ſupply a greater company of Spirits) exceeds the other in magnitude. If the Muſcle, whereby it may be the ſtronger, is big and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with an ample bulk or ſubſtance, it is divided as it were into many Lobes or Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and two Tendons are ordained to each of them; to wit, to the end that the animal Spirits might be carried through ſhort paſſages from the Tendons into the fleſhy fibres, and might leap back again: becauſe the compounded Muſcle doth not always contain more ſeries of moving fibres, that it might perform many and divers motions,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:152521:118"/>
but that it might make the ſame motion often with the greater ſtrength. For, as we hinted before, as a ſimple Muſcle was as a ſingle leaver or bar, the compound ſeems as if it were many leavers or bars ſerving for the removing the ſame body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly.</p>
                           <p>Further, hence we may obſerve in ſome Muſcles, which are ſimple and regular, that all the fleſhy fibres are equal, and ſo all the tendinous of one extreme being put together, are equal to all of the other end being put together; yet they ſingle, where they are ſhorter in one Tendon, are longer in the other, and ſo diſpoſed, that the tendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous fibres on either part, the top and bottom, have their exceſſes inverſe, and at once equal; to wit, that here a long is laid upon a ſhort, or the longeſt upon the ſhorteſt, and there quite contrary; the ſhorteſt upon the longeſt, to the end, that the motion might be ſo made every where in this or that ſide of the Muſcle, or at the end more ſtrong, more plentiful Spirits flow together into thoſe parts from the longer ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinous fibres, and on the contrary: wherefore in ſome Muſcles leſs neceſſary, where the part of the fleſh growing to the bone, either becomes immoveable, or only ſerves for the filling up of empty ſpaces, one Tendon is ſhorter or leſſer, and oftentimes degenerates into a bony or cartilaginous hardneſs. Further it is obſerved, as to other ſtrong and greatly moving Muſcles, that their Tendons are not ſo diſpoſed, as if they were only ſtays, props, handles, or hanging crooks of the fleſhy fibres; for ſo they are only conſtituted in their extreme ends; yet the tendinous fibres, that they may be made more apt promptuaries of the animal Spirits, being ſtretched out almoſt into all parts of the Muſcle, receive every where both ends of the fleſhy; which indeed yet more manifeſtly appears in the compound Muſcles, for that one Tendon being compounded, embraces the extreme fleſh, and the other enters into the middle of the fleſh, as hath been already ſhewn.</p>
                           <p>But truly the animal Spirits, whilſt they leap out of the tendinous into the fleſhy fibres, are not ſufficient of themſelves for the wrinkling of them, but require another elaſtick Copula from the blood; this may be argued from many reaſons. Firſt, it ſeems to appear from this, that the ſame Spirits being ſolitary or by themſelves, though moſt thickly planted within the Tendons, ſtir up no Tumor or Contraction whilſt they are moved in them; wherefore being dilated within the fleſhy fibres in a leſſer quantity, and having got a larger ſpace, they would be ſtretched out, unleſs they met or ſtrove with other Particles, much leſs would they obtain a contractive force. Beſides, when any wound or grievous trouble happens to a Tendon, the belly of the Muſcle or fleſhy part is chiefly troubled with a Tumor or Spaſm; for the Spirits being irritated, not ſo much within themſelves, but where they are violently driven among heterogene Particles, ſtir up the greateſt tumults and inordinations. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when the fleſhy fibres are watered with the ſanguineous humor beyond other parts, and more than may ſuffice for their nouriſhment, for what other uſe ſhould it be aſſigned, unleſs that it may contribute to the motive function? Eſpecially we take notice in lean Bodies, which are more ſparingly nouriſhed, that the Muſcles being fuſed or drenched with more plentiful blood, do perform the ſtrongeſt endeavours of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: moreover, it doth not appear by what way beſides, the expence of the Spirits in a Muſcle, conſumed with continual hard motions or labours, ſhould be made up or renewed, unleſs, beſides the ſmall ſupplements by the Nerves, others ſufficiently plentiful ſhould be ſupplied from the bloody maſs. Add to theſe, that members deſtitute of the wonted afflux of blood, eaſily fall into weakneſs or a Palſie; and that from the obſervation of Doctor <hi>Steno,</hi> in a live Dog the trunk of the deſcending Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery being tyed, all the lower or poſterior members were ſuddenly deprived of motion. And though it doth not yet appear plainly to me, whether the excluſion of the blood from the ſpinal Marrow, or from the Muſcles themſelves, or from both together, be the cauſe; yet however it comes almoſt to the ſame thing, for as much as the animal Spirits being procreated within the Head, and ſtretched out by the medullary and nervous Appendices into every member, without the concourſe of the blood, they ſhould not be able to perform the loco-motive power.</p>
                           <p>Having thus far explained by what means a Muſcle being contracted in the fleſhy part, as to all the fibres at once, performs the motive function; we ſhall next inquire, what is the reaſon of the Inſtinct whereby every motion, both regular and irregular, is wont to be obeyed or is performed. Concerning this in general, it firſt appears, that the motions of every regular motion, yea and the impulſes of ſome irregular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being conceived within the Brain or Cerebel, are tranſmitted from thence by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:152521:119"/>
the Nerves to every Muſcle. This (as we have elſewhere ſhewn) is moſt evidently declared by the effects and conſequences: yet here great difficulties remain, to wit, how by the ſame paſſages freſh forces of animal Spirits are conveyed from the Head to every Muſcle, and at the ſame time the old ones exerciſing the Empire of the Soul; beſides, with what difference and divers carriage of the inflowing Spirits, the Nerves perform either of theſe tasks, or both theſe offices.</p>
                           <p>Of theſe, as I conjecture, it ſeems that the animal Spirits, which flowing conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually from the Head to refreſh the forces of the implanted Spirits, are carried to the Muſcle by the Nerves, do move to it quietly and eaſily, and being there preſently received by the membranaceous Fibres, they go apart into the Tendons: which kind of relief, although it ſhould be but little in bulk, yet becauſe it is carried night and day by a conſtant courſe, it eaſily ariſes to a ſufficient proviſion for the continual fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up of the Tendons. But that we ſuppoſe, the Spirits ſo brought perpetually to the Muſcle to be transferred by the membranaceous Fibres, and not by the fleſhy, to the Tendons, the reaſon is, becauſe if they ſhould firſt enter into theſe, ſtraight run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into an elaſtick Copula, they would ſtir up the Muſcle into continual motions: more over, for that in the Heart and Muſcles of Reſpiration the fleſhy Fibres are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed with a perpetual motion, they wait not for the paſſage of freſh Spirits to the Tendons.</p>
                           <p>But as to what reſpects the Inſtincts delivered through the Nerves from the Head for the performing, or ſtaying, or any ways altering of the muſculary motion, of theſe we ought firſt to conſider, that the moving animal Spirits, whoſe companies or throngs conſtitute the Hypoſtaſis of the bodily Soul, have theſe two properties as it were implanted in their nature; to wit, that whilſt they are lively, numerous, and free, they exert or expand themſelves, then that force being finiſhed, they being a little diminiſhed, retire themſelves and grow quiet; but afterwards being refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they leap out again, and ſo viciſſively. Waking and ſleep, and the alterations of work and idleneſs or reſt, inbred in all living Creatures, ſufficiently declare this. Wherefore to the impulſe or inſtincts of ſome Muſcles, (which are wont to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually contracted and releaſed) ſcarce any thing more is required, but that their Tendons may be ſupplied by the Nerves with a conſtant influx of animal Spirits; but the Spirits themſelves, becauſe they are numerous and expeditious of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, do willingly leap out into the moving Fibres, then the charge being performed, after a ſmall loſs or expence, they immediately withdraw, and being again preſently recruited, they are again expanded, and ſo viciſſively. Further, their actions (which chiefly are Pulſe and Breathing) are variouſly changed according to the degrees of heat or of the affections, for as much as the Spirits being brought by the Nerves, are ſent from the Cerebel, ſometimes more remiſly, ſometimes more plentifully, or more nimbly.</p>
                           <p>Further, in ſome other Muſcles ſubject to the Empire of the Appetite, as the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits naturally affect turns of expanſion and receſs, there is only need of a ſign to be given, either for the performing or ſtopping of the commanded motion; either of which, the inflowing Spirits by their various knocking againſt the Muſcle, eaſily perform, in ordering the implanted Spirits into various aſpects or tendencies. When the Muſcle is contracted, the implanted Spirits, whilſt they are looſned from either end towards the middle, look and tend with a changed front from the middle towards either end. And ſo, whilſt the inflowing Spirits carry the Symbol of performing Contraction, they being incited by heaps within the Nerve, more fully blow up its end, inſerted to the Muſcle, (where they are more thickly crowded together) and ſo cauſe it there to be contracted and abbreviated; whereby it comes to paſs, that the ſame inflowing Spirits, about to enter into the Muſcle, are at that time ſtopped by a mere heap, or rather are called back towards the intumified Nerve; wherefore by and by the whole ſeries of the implanted Spirits (hence their inclination being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) alſo looks that way, and ſo the inhabitants of the Tendons, leaping out from their little Cells into the fleſhy Fibres, cauſe motive contraction: then the motion is broken off or ceaſes aſſoon as the Spirits being before called back towards the Nerve, do tend again into the Muſcle, and ſo the front of the Army being again changed, bands of the implanted Spirits are preſently compelled into the Tendons. That the thing is in a manner thus, I am perſwaded, not out of a mere agreeableneſs or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinnity of our Hypotheſis, but from Anatomical obſervation. Becauſe once diſſect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Whelp alive, when by chance I beheld ſome Muſcles of the hinder part of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:152521:119"/>
Head and Neck divided and ſeparated at the ſame inſtant, wherein the fleſhy Fibres, as alſo the Nerves inſerted into them, were ſeen at once to be contracted, and being intumified, to be abbreviated.</p>
                           <p>For the promoting the receſs of the Spirits out of the fleſhy Fibres into the Tendons, whilſt the Muſcle is contracted, the membranaceous Fibrils, which every where cut croſs-wiſe the fleſhy, and thickly ſtick between, ſeem to help. The texture of theſe never to be enough admired, is better perceived in a Muſcle endued with large Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, <hi>viz.</hi> an Oxes being boiled to a tenderneſs. For in ſuch a one, if gently opening the fleſhy Fibres, you ſhall draw them one from another through the whole ſeries, you ſhall ſee little Fibrils, like hairs, moſt thickly extended upon every one of thoſe Tubes, which little Fibrils not only cloſe and knit together the fleſhy Fibres, but alſo lying upon every one of their ſeries, and cutting them in oblique Angles, they alſo are all carried parallel, from Tendon to Tendon, in an oppoſite ſite to the fleſhy: therefore whilſt the Muſcle being contracted, the fleſhy Fibres do ſwell up, the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brils embracing them, that they may give place, are ſomewhat diſtended; then as ſoon as the ſwelling up remits, theſe returning to their wonted ſtraitneſs, preſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether every where the fleſh, and the Spirits being expulſed on either ſide, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to their priſtine length. It makes for this, that whilſt the Muſcle is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, the Spirits inflowing through the Nerves, depart from their membranaceous Fibrils; wherefore theſe being empty and lax, are able more eaſily to be diſtended; but whilſt the Muſcle is relaxed, the Spirits again entring the Fibrils, fill them, and that they may the better bind the fleſhy Fibres, they make them ſhorter.</p>
                           <p>The Inſtincts of Motions, to be obeyed by the Muſcles, ſo delivered by the Nerves, are, being ſent either from the Brain, performed at the command, and with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Appetite; or from the Cerebel, according to the Laws of Nature, for the moſt part unknown to us. But beſides, ſometimes the Muſcles are carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, or contrary to the pleaſure of the Appetite or Nature, into irregular motions, <hi>viz.</hi> violent and convulſive, and that happens after various manners and for divers cauſes. Concerning theſe, ſome time ſince diſcourſing more largely, we have ſhewn, that from thence do ariſe many kinds and differences of convulſive motions; as the Spaſmodick matter being ſomewhere fixed, doth ſubſiſt either about the beginnings, middle, or ends of the Nerves; or becauſe the ſame thing being wandring and looſe, runs about here and there through the whole paſſages of the Nerves, and ſo variouſly transfers from place to place convulſive diſtempers. But beſides theſe divers kinds of Convulſions, which are excited by reaſon of ſome evil or vice ſticking ſomewhere to the Nerves themſelves, this our Myology or Doctrine of the Muſcles, hath diſcovered ſome Convulſions of another kind ariſing from the Muſcles being chiefly affected.</p>
                           <p>For indeed we muſt advertiſe you, that the animal Spirits, diſpoſed among the Muſcles themſelves, by reaſon of a taint or evil derived from the Brain, or from the Blood, or perhaps oftentimes from both together, are infected with certain hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene Particles, by reaſon of which they cannot reſt or lye quiet in their Cells; but being always unquiet and reſtleſs, leap out of their own accord from the tendinous Fibres into the fleſhy, and ſo oftentimes produce frequent and cruel Convulſions. But this we have obſerved to be done after a twofold manner, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, for that the Spirits being burdened with an elaſtick Copula, remain not long within the Tendons, but leaping out from thence into the fleſhy Fibres, induce frequent Convulſions of a Muſcle, but ſhort, and as it were by leaps; or ſecondly, becauſe the animal Spirits, although they ſometimes lye quietly within the Tendons, yet being inordinately ſnatched into the fleſh, and there cruelly exploded, they cannot be preſently repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, brought into order, or reduced into the Tendons, but whether we will or not, they perſiſt a long while expanded, and ſo bring forth a long and very painful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the Muſcle. Which kind of Spaſm, ſufficiently known, we vulgarly term the Cramp.</p>
                           <p>The former diſtemper (called the Convulſive Leaping) is familiar both to malignant Feavers, and to the Scurvy. As to thoſe, we have ordinarily known, when either no Criſis, or an evil one is obtained, that heterogene Particles from the blood and nervous juyce very much vitiated, are not only laid up in the Bowels, (whoſe diſpoſitions and functions they pervert) but almoſt every where in the Muſcles; and there growing to the Spirits, do affect them with a certain madneſs, ſo as they cannot continue peaceably together, or reſt within the Tendons, but being divided and diſtracted one from another, leap out from thence by bands into the fleſh, and there ſtir up the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152521:120"/>
leſſer and moſt frequent Spaſms or Convulſions. In like manner, by reaſon of the Spirits inhabiting the Muſcles, being burdened with an elaſtick Copula there growing to them, ſome labouring with an inveterate Scurvy, cannot contain their limbs in the ſame ſite or poſition, but are neceſſitated ſometimes to extend the hands or feet, ſometimes to fling them about here and there, to transfer them variouſly, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſubdue their madneſs by running, leaping, or other hard labours.</p>
                           <p>Treating ſome time ſince of Convulſive Motions, we did almoſt wholly omit the Aetiology of the continuing Spaſm or Tetaniſm, as a thing which depended upon the Doctrine of the Muſcles, to be treated of afterwards: Then we only hinted, that the contraction of that kind did ariſe in one Muſcle, becauſe its other Antagoniſt was reſolved or looſned, which indeed oftentimes happens in the face and ſome members; in which, whilſt the parts upon one ſide are troubled with the Palſie, thoſe oppoſite on the other, as it were looſned in the Reins, are too much contracted. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this kind of Spaſm for the moſt part is without pain; beſides, this is not eaſily or preſently paſſed over or cured no more than the Palſie, which is the cauſe of it.</p>
                           <p>Therefore as to what belongs to the formal reaſon of the Spaſm, called in our Idiom the Cramp; every one labouring with this diſtemper, perceives in himſelf one or more Muſcles to be moſt ſtrongly and involuntarily drawn together, and they being for ſome time ſo highly diſtended, remain as it were ſtiff; and in the mean time, for that the fleſhy Fibres being cruelly contracted, do violently haul or pull either Tendon, to wit, that which is fixed to the immoveable part, perhaps no leſs than the other part to be moved, they cauſe a moſt troubleſom pain. But ſometimes this Spaſm being excited, by reaſon of the animal Spirits carrying themſelves out im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuouſly into the fleſhy Fibres, doth not ceaſe until the ſame Spirits being returned into the Tendons, ſuffer the fleſh to be relaxed; therefore its neareſt cauſes will be both the greater impetuoſity of the animal Spirits among the fleſhy Fibres, with which they leap thither unbid; and alſo their long continuance or ſtay, for that they return back more ſlowly and difficultly into the Tendons. For the ſecondary cauſes may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned, both the evil diſpoſition of the animal Spirits, and alſo the evil conformation of the Tendons, <hi>viz.</hi> ſometimes this, ſometimes that, and not ſeldom both together.</p>
                           <p>As to the former; this diſtemper, as other Convulſions, ſeems to ariſe, for as much as the animal Spirits, being burdened with heterogeneous Particles or an elaſtick Copula, at length being irritated, they are incited to the ſtriking of it off: which notwithſtanding, being thick and viſcous, and for that cauſe more tenacious, is not ſoon nor eaſily ſhaken off, but that the Spirits being ſtill provoked by the ſame, and ſhut up within the fleſhy Fibres, are longer detained in the expanſion: which thing perhaps happens not ſo much unlike, as when water and air being joyned together, make a bubble; which, if it be made of water, wherein a little Sope is put, is more tenacious, much more large, and continues longer than that made only of mere wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So we obſerve, that they who abound in thick and tartareous humours, are moſt obnoxious to theſe kind of Cramps, and beſides, that they who preſently ſleep upon drinking or eating groſs meats, after full eating, and eſpecially after a large and plentiful ſupper, do ſuffer moſt cruel aſſaults of this diſeaſe; but ſometimes the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons themſelves are found to be in the fault, for that they being too hard bound to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether or obſtructed, they do not eaſily admit the Spirits returning from the fleſhy Fibres. The obſtruction of the Tendons is the cauſe, that Gouty and Scorbutick peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe Tendons ſalt and tartareous humours eaſily run into and obſtruct, are wont to be cruelly tormented with theſe kind of painful Cramps: But that the conſtriction of the Tendons doth ſometimes bring forth this diſeaſe, appears by this, for that ſome Women with Child, (as I have been often told) about the latter end of their Time, by reaſon of the Muſcles of the Abdomen being too much extended, are wont to be troubled with frequent Cramps, only in the bottom of their Bellies. For the illuſtrating of this Pathology we will add this following Caſe.</p>
                           <p>A Noble Woman, young and fair, ſome time ſince obnoxious to Hyſterick diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and now above two years ago to Convulſive, and in a manner Epileptical; of late, by reaſon of the frequent and moſt cruel aſſaults of the diſeaſe, ſhe became alſo Cachectical and Paralytical, that at length her Abdomen was diſtempered with an Aſcites, and her Legs with a wateriſh Tumor, and laſtly, all her lower parts, below her Hips, were deprived of motion; hence, as often as the Convulſive fits infeſted her, ſhe was wont, not now to move her body or members here and there, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:152521:120"/>
theſe, ſometimes thoſe parts being ſnatched with the Tetaniſm, were variouſly bent and twiſted about, that in the mean time, ſhe her ſelf ſitting in her Bed or Chair, remained ſtiff and almoſt immoveable. It is not long ſince, that ſeeing the whole manner of one of theſe Fits, I obſerved, not without great admiration, divers ſorts of turns and changes of alterations of the Spaſms. At the firſt aſſault, her eyes being turned about ſwiftly hither and thither, ſhe was preſently taken with inſenſibility, then by and by her head being turned and contracted of one ſide, preſently her arms and legs at once became ſtiff, and all her Joynts, ſometimes of one ſide, ſometimes of both, were bowed or ſtretched out: perhaps after four or five minutes theſe Spaſms both in her Head and Limbs remitting, of a ſudden others, for the moſt part oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, followed; which being often finiſhed in the like ſpace, others far different did ariſe, and ſo for two or three hours, longer Spaſms almoſt of every kind and faſhion; being excited through her whole Body, followed upon one another; ſo that her head being convulſed or pulled by turns from the right to the left, and contracted before and behind, yea and all her Limbs being bent inwardly here and there, or diſtended outwardly in the Courſe of one Fit, ſhe exhibited all ſorts of Convulſive geſtures. When at any time the Spaſms of one ſort continued longer in the Head or Limbs than uſual, it was the cuſtom of the Servants about her to blow up ſtrongly into her No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils the Fume of Tabaco; which being done, as the Spirits recovered within, the preſent Spaſms immediately remitted, but upon them others of a new kind ſucceeded. Of late the Legs of this Lady were ſo debilitated by being looſned, that ſhe could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go nor ſtand, yea her Tendons under either Ham, being made tumid and ſhorter, were ſo contracted, that ſhe could not ſtretch out her Legs ſtraight.</p>
                           <p>Concerning the caſe of this ſick Noble Lady, it may be demanded, wherefore upon the firſt coming of the Fit, no throwing about of the Body or Limbs, as is wont in moſt Convulſive or Epileptical people, but only continued Spaſms or Convulſions variouſly tranſlated from one part to another, and ſo others, did ariſe? For the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, we ſay, that the Spaſmodick matter is not only heaped up in the Brain and Nerves, but alſo in the Muſcles themſelves, and grows to the Spirits inhabiting the Tendons: And as that matter is tenacious, and the Spirits weak, and unable for the ſtriking off quickly or eaſily ſuch a Copula; therefore as often as theſe being irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, do leap out of the Tendons into the fleſh, the Muſcles being firſt poſſeſt, they cauſe ſtrong and long Contractions; in the mean time, other Muſcles, eſpecially their Antagoniſts or oppoſites, being hindred and bound up from motion, until the Convulſions of the former are remitted; hence the Members, however convulſed, are not moved out of their place, becauſe the moving or carrying of the Body, or any Members, is not performed but by the help or duty of many Muſcles, whilſt ſome of them either rightly cooperate with others, or at leaſt obey them, to wit, ſo that ſome reſpective Muſcles, obſerving due cooperation, are contracted at once, then thoſe being looſned, the contraction of others immediately ſucceeds. But if they which are unequal and unlike, are at once contracted and ſtrongly convulſed, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long, ſo that other Muſcles in the mean time cannot be contracted, there will be a neceſſity for the members bent or extended here and there, to remain as they are wholly ſtiff. But that the preſent Convulſions were always remitted by the blowing the ſmoke of Tabaco up her Noſe, the reaſon is, becauſe the region or ſome part of the bodily Soul being vehemently affected, if by chance a new paſſion equally violent be brought upon another part, the firſt is preſently aboliſhed or ceaſes: For in truth, it appears by conſtant obſervation, where-ever the greater or freſher trouble is, that thither greater plenty of Spirits preſently flock and make a tumult: wherefore any new irritation being excited in the Brain or its Meninges, whatſoever others were begun outwardly among the Muſcles, immediately vaniſh or are obſcured; then as ſoon as this freſh trouble is paſſed over, Convulſions outwardly ariſe forthwith again, but in other parts where more heaps of Spaſmodick matter lye not yet conſumed. But that long continued Spaſms do ariſe, either by reaſon of the Spirits being burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a more tenacious Copula, or by reaſon of the Tendons being obſtructed with a viſcous or tartareous matter from either or both, it appears from hence, becauſe this diſeaſe increaſing (as in the caſe of this Noble Lady) the Tendons are at length ſo ſhortned by the more plentiful heaping up of the morbifick matter, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtiff and ſhorter, and for that reaſon they hardly or not at all grant any place to the Spirits for the conſtant performing of the motive function.</p>
                           <p>Thus much for the Muſculary Motion, both natural and convulſive, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:152521:121"/>
of both, which we have proved with what diligence we were able, and by Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomical Experiments: But if any one ſhall object, that they are not very firm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have noted in the cutting up of live Creatures, that the Heart and Muſcles of Reſpiration and the fleſhy Pannicle, after that the Nerves and Arteries are cut away, do continue for ſome time their turns of Contraction and Relaxation, whence it is argued, againſt our Hypotheſis, that their motions do not depend upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant influx of the blood and animal Spirits; it will be plain to return this Anſwer, That in thoſe about to dye, it ſometimes happens ſo, becauſe the Soul being then diſtracted and drawing near to diſſolution, all the implanted Spirits at once being cut off from the commerce of thoſe influencing or flowing in, do of their own accord exert themſelves, and perform (as long as they are able) their wonted motions; which being continued for a little ſpace only, need not the ſubſidy or aſſiſtance of freſh forces, becauſe the veterane, till they are quite worn out, perform their wonted tasks; yea alſo the old ſanguineous Copula, till it be wholly conſumed, receives and lets go their embraces with a conſtant change: But this more rarely ſucceeds in other Muſcles ſubject to the Empire of the Appetite, and wont only to be exerciſed as occaſion ſerved.</p>
                           <p>Moreover, as we have affirmed, that the Inſtinct for the performing of Motions is brought altogether through the Nerves from the Head to the Muſcle, and as every Trunk of the ſame Nerve, being oftentimes broken into many ſhoots, variouſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing them, ſends it to many deſtinated Muſcles, it may very well be doubted, how the animal Spirits, conveying the Symbol of the motion to be performed with a certain choice, do actuate only theſe or thoſe branches apart from other branches of the ſame, and do not indifferently enter all the branches or ſhoots of the ſame; to wit, as the blood paſſes through the Trunk of the Artery, and all its ramifications equally. The moſt Learned <hi>Regius,</hi> that he might ſolve this knot, ſuppoſes in the Nerves ſome little doors, like to thoſe which are found in muſical Organs, the aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whereof admit the Spirits to theſe or thoſe parts eſpecially, the reſt being ſhut up. But he ought to have ſhewn, if not the little doors themſelves, yet at leaſt by what inſtinct and by whoſe direction ſometimes theſe, ſometimes thoſe are locked up, and others opened. But in truth, this may rather be ſaid, that all the ſhoots of the Nerves and leſſer branches remain diſtinct and ſingular among themſelves from the parts to which they are inſerted, even to their beginnings; ſo that a peculiar tract of the Spirits or way of paſſage lyes open, from the Brain and its medullary Appendix, to every Muſcle and nervous part; for in truth, although the Nerves, according to their beginnings, may ſeem to ariſe from the greater Trunks; yet it will eaſily appear, if you ſhall open the trunk and thoſe branches, that in them many little Nerves, only like hairs, for the ſake of a better conduct, are collected together in the ſame bundle; yea, the coverings being ſeparated, you may follow oftentimes the little Nervulets, and thoſe ſingle to the reſpective parts and members, to which they are deſtinated.</p>
                           <p>But in the mean time, although there be ſingular paſſages or chanels of the animal Spirits of moſt Nerves, diſtinct among themſelves; yet ſome do variouſly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with others through the branches and ſhoots ſent on either ſide; which indeed ought to be ſo made, that when many Nerves together, are required to ſome motion of a Muſcle equally, all theſe, by reaſon of the commerce mutually had between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, might conſpire in the ſame action; hence, in ſome motions of the members, as in the ſtriking of a Harp or Lute and other complicated actions, many Muſcles co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with admirable celerity; ſo that, although many be imployed at once, they perform their task ſeverally without any confuſion. Beſides, there is need for the Nerves to communicate mutually among themſelves, becauſe of the Sympathetical motions of the members and of ſome of the parts, for neither for any other cauſe is the Nerve of the Diaphragma inſerted into the brachial branches, or thoſe belonging to the Arms, than that the exerciſe of living Creatures, eſpecially in running or fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, might be proportionate to the tenour of Reſpiration. Hence it alſo proceeds, that in any paſſion, the Praecordia being bound up or dilated, the countenance and aſpect of the face, yea and the geſtures of the hands and members are pathetically figured. We have propoſed ſufficient Inſtances of this ſort in our particular Hiſtory of the Nerves, ſo that we need not here add any thing more.</p>
                           <p>What remains for the illuſtrating our Myology or Tract of the Muſcles, we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care to have added, <hi>viz.</hi> four Figures, which may repreſent to the life both the exteriour and interiour true and natural faces or appearances both of a ſimple and compounded Muſcle.</p>

                        <p>ONCE more your <hi>Sidley</hi> Profeſſor and your Servant (the more happy Title) flings himſelf at Your feet, with this only Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he might render ſomething of Thanks for Your Kindneſs and benefits, and that our Labours might chuſe ſuch a Patron, that might give Credit to the Author. But I fear, leſt by my repeated Duty I may ſeem troubleſom, and no leſs in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging Your Benefits, than others in ſuing for them: But ſo great is my Gratitude, and ſo exceeding is Your good Nature, that they cannot be crowded into a little compaſs, much leſs wearied out or drawn dry.</p>
                        <p>But there is another Reaſon, which if it doth not command what I do, may at leaſt excuſe and defend it. For when I had reſolved to unlock the ſecret places of Mans Mind, and to look into the living and breathing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the Deity (as far as our weakneſs was able) I thought it not lawful to make uſe of the Favours and Patronage of a leſs Perſon, neither perhaps would it have become me. For You indeed are He, who moſt happily preſides (both by Merit and Authority) over all our Temples and Sacred Things. Therefore after I had ſlain ſo many Victims, whole Hecatombs almoſt of all Animals, in the Anatomical Court, I could not have thought them rightly offered, unleſs they had been brought to the moſt holy Altar of Your Grace.</p>
                        <p>I am not ignorant, how great the labour is that I undertake: For it hath been a long while accounted as a certain Myſtery and School-houſe of Atheiſm to ſearch into Nature, as if whatever Reaſons we grant to Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, ſhould derogate from Religion, and all that ſhould be attributed to ſecond Cauſes, did take away from the firſt.</p>
                        <p>But truly, he doth too much abuſe the Name of Philoſophy, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the wheels, curious frame, ſetting together, ſmall pins, and all the make and proviſion of a Clock, by which invented Machine the courſe of the Time, the orders of the Months, the changes of the Planets, the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ebbing of the Sea, and other things of that kind, may be exactly known and meaſured, if that at length, when by this his ſearch and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<pb facs="tcp:152521:124"/>
he hath profited himſelf ſo much, he ſhould not acknowledge the Artiſt, to whoſe Labour and Wit he owes all thoſe things.</p>
                        <p>I am ſure I am of another mind and opinion, who look into the Pandects of Nature, as into another Table of the Divine Word, and the greater Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: For indeed, in either Volume there is no high point, which requires not the care, or refuſes the induſtry of an Interpreter; there is no Page certainly which ſhews not the Author, and his Power, Goodneſs, Truſt, and Wiſdom.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, there is no right Weigher of things that can lay to our charge as a fault, that we have ſtudied theſe Rolls of Nature, becauſe ſome Atheiſts may be made thereby; which may be objected to the ſtudies of Divines in Sacred Letters, that from their proviſion Hereticks have taken their Arguments and Opinions, and turned them againſt them and Godlineſs.</p>
                        <p>That I may deal freely, whoever profeſſes Philoſophy, and doth not think rightly of God, I do judge him not only to have ſhaken hands with Religion, but alſo with Reaſon, and that he hath at once put off Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy as well as Chriſtianity. Therefore I deſire, that all mine may be tryed and approved, no leſs by the demonſtration of Piety and Canons of the Church, than by the Rule of Experience and Knowledge, to which I keep: Neither do I intreat and reſpect only the <hi>Mecaenas</hi> of humane Arts, but alſo the Primate and chief of Divine, whilſt I openly profeſs my ſelf, with all due obſervance,</p>

                        <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
                        <p>THE Romans ſometimes promiſed to themſelves an Empire, an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by the happy Augury of an humane Head being turned out of the Glebe; neither could they perſwade themſelves, that the Capitol ſhould be the Head of the World, unleſs it had been built upon the Skull of a Man. I do not think of Empires in Arts, nor do I promiſe to my ſelf Triumphs by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the World of Letters: But in the mean time, I had wholly fruſtrated thoſe Illuſtrious Documents I had long ſince learned, unleſs with thoſe Auſpices I had laboured in Philoſophy, eſpecially the Natural.</p>
                        <p>For the Province, which I hold in this Academy, requiring that I ſhould Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Offices of the Senſes, both external and alſo internal, and of the Faculties and Affections of the Soul, as alſo of the Organs and various provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of all theſe; I had thought of ſome rational Arguments for that purpoſe, and from the appearances raiſed ſome not unlikely Hypotheſes, which (as uſes to be in theſe kind of buſineſſes) at length accrued into a certain Syſtem of Art and frame of Doctrine. But when at laſt the force of Invention being ſpent, I had handled each again, and brought them to a ſeverer teſt, I ſeemed to my ſelf, like a Painter, that had delineated the Head of a Man, not after the form of a Maſter, but at the will of a bold Fancy and Pencil, and had followed not that which was moſt true, but what was moſt convenient, and what was rather deſired than what was known. Thinking on theſe things ſeriouſly with my ſelf, I awaked at length ſad, as one out of a pleaſant dream; to wit, I was aſhamed that I had been ſo eaſie hitherto, and that I had drawn out for my ſelf and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors a certain Poetical Philoſophy and Phyſick neatly wrought with Novity and Conjectures, and had made a <hi>Fucus</hi> as it were with deceits and incanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for either of us.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore all delay being laid aſide, I determined with my ſelf ſeriouſly to enter preſently upon a new courſe, and to rely on this one thing, not to pin my faith on the received Opinions of others, nor on the ſuſpicions and gueſſes of my own mind, but for the future to believe Nature and ocular demonſtrations: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thenceforward I betook my ſelf wholly to the ſtudy of Anatomy: and as I did chiefly inquire into the offices and uſes of the Brain and its nervous Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, I addicted my ſelf to the opening of Heads eſpecially, and of every kind, and to inſpect as much as I was able frequently and ſeriouſly the Contents; that after the figures, ſites, proceſſes of the whole and ſingular parts ſhould be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with their other bodies, reſpects, and habits, ſome truth might at length be drawn forth concerning the exerciſe, defects, and irregularities of the Animal Government; and ſo a firm and ſtable Baſis might be laid, on which not only a more certain Phyſiologie than I had gained in the Schools, but what I had long thought upon, the Pathologie of the Brain and nervous ſtock, might be built.</p>
                        <p>But for the more accurate performing this work, as I had not leiſure, and perhaps not wit enough of my ſelf, I was not aſhamed to require the help of others. And here I made uſe of the Labours of the moſt Learned Phyſician and highly skilful Anatomiſt, Doctor <hi>Richard Lower,</hi> for my help and Companion; the edge of whoſe Knife and Wit I willingly acknowledge to have been an help to me for the better ſearching out both the frame and offices of before hidden Bodies. Wherefore having got this help and Companion, no day almoſt paſt over without ſome Anatomical adminiſtration; ſo that in a ſhort ſpace there was nothing of the Brain, and its Appendix within the Skull, that ſeemed not plainly detected, and intimately beheld by us. After this, when we entred upon a far more difficult task, <hi>viz.</hi> the Anatomy of the Nerves, then very much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb facs="tcp:152521:125"/>
the plainly to be admired skill of this Man, as alſo his indefatigable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and unwearied Labour: For having proſecuted, with a moſt exact ſearch, all the divarications, wandring on every ſide of the Nerve, how minute or ſmall ſoever, and immerſed, and variouſly infolded within other Bodies, and ſo turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Labyrinths of the Branches, and ſhoots of every pair, far and near diffuſed, he drew out with his own hand the Schemes, Images, or Draughts of them, and alſo of many paſſages of the Blood, as they appear in this Tract; which indeed, that they might be faithfully and moſt exactly ſhewn, without any falſity or errour, he cauſed, that no Table might contain ſcarce any line or the moſt light paſſage, whoſe conformation and exact habitude he had not found proved by the marks or inſpection of many Animals for that purpoſe killed.</p>
                        <p>Beſides the helps brought me by his moſt skilful diſſecting hand, it becomes me not to hide, how much beſides I did receive from theſe moſt famous Men, Dr. <hi>Thomas Millington</hi> Doctor in Phyſick, and Dr. <hi>Chr. Wren</hi> Doctor of Laws, and <hi>Savill</hi> Profeſſor of Aſtronomy; both which were wont frequently to be preſent at our Diſſections, and to confer and reaſon about the uſes of the Parts. Beſides, the former most Learned Man, to whom I from day to day propoſed privately my Conjectures and Obſervations, often confirmed me by his Suffrage, being uncertain in my mind, and not truſting to my own opinion. But the other moſt renowned Man, Dr. <hi>Wren,</hi> was pleaſed out of his ſingular humanity, wherewith he abounds, to delineate with his own moſt skilful hands many Figures of the Brain and Skull, whereby the work might be more exact.</p>
                        <p>But although inſtructed by theſe helps, and as it were hem'd in by the plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful aſſiſtances of theſe Illuſtrious Men, I come forth on the Stage, I preſume I ſhall not be however ſafe from calumny, and free from blame and most juſt repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion: becauſe here is inquired into the receſſes and moſt inward dens of the Brain, and its depending parts as it were ſhut and ſealed up; concerning the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain uſes of which, ſcarce any thing may be brought forth, but that, as it may be publiſhed and ſhewn, for the Judgments of the more Learned, ſo it may be carpt at and torn by the opprobries of detractors. In other parts, where matters appear to the Senſes, we do not ſo eaſily run upon errours. For in moſt of the Viſcera and Veſſels, the Contents and contained humors, as alſo their paſſages within the larger Cavities of the containing parts, are diſcerned by the ſight: But in the Brain and Nerves, neither the ruſhings on or impreſſions, <hi>viz.</hi> the Animal Spirits themſelves, nor their tracts or footſteps, can any ways be ſeen. Wherefore to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the uſes of the Brain, ſeems as difficult a task as to paint the Soul, of which it is commonly ſaid, That it underſtands all things but it ſelf: for in truth, the unwearied labour of the Brain beholds or ſearches the hidden places of other Bodies, in the mean time the oeconomy or regiment of its own Family and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom being wholly hid and unknown.</p>
                        <p>But what we profeſs to be performed by us in the following Tract, and hope for the future from the help or labour of others, is chiefly this; to wit, that we have not raſhly deſcribed the parts themſelves, of which the Anatomy is inſtituted, but that we have with diligent care and great truſt collected the various appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances and Arguments of Obſervations by a manifold Diſſection. Which things, if you ſhall delineate out of thoſe Sentences and granted Decrees, as it were to a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Rule, and from thence would collect a Theory, as yet lame, and that may not appear abſolute in all its numbers, no doubt but that a longer time, and the getting of more Obſervations may give it a more perfect form, that Antiquity may not have ſaid altogether in vain, That <hi>Minerva</hi> was born from the Brain, <hi>Vulcan</hi> with his Inſtruments playing the Midwife: For either by this way, <hi>viz.</hi> by Wounds and Death, by Anatomy, and a Caeſarean Birth, Truth will be brought to Light, or for ever lye hid.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The Method or Anatomical Adminiſtration of Diſſecting the Brain is propoſed.</head>
                           <p>AMong the various parts of an animated Body, which are ſubject to Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical diſquiſition, none is preſumed to be eaſier or better known than the Brain; yet in the mean time, there is none leſs or more imperfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. All of it that appears, and is commonly deſcribed in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part or forehead, is beheld almoſt at a ſight or two after ſome rude cutting up; but if you ſeek what lyes hid in the receſſes for that end, new boſoms and productions of Bodies, before hid, are every where laid open: yea the parts of the Brain it ſelf are ſo complicated and involved, and their reſpects and habitudes to one another ſo hard to be extricated, that it may ſeem a more hard task to inſtitute its perfect Anatomy, than to delineate on a plain, the flexions and Meanders of ſome Labyrinth: Becauſe, as we are not able to eſtimate the meaſure or to paint forth the pattern or draught of the frame of this, ſo neither of that, unleſs the bulk or ſubſtance of the ſubject be firſt ſearched to the bottom, and its frame broken into pieces. Hence it came to paſs, that the old Anatomiſts in diſſecting the Brain, not ſufficiently attending what was placed firſt, what ſecond, and what after that in the order of Nature, cut its Globe as it were into ſlices or parts, and the Phaenomena ariſing by chance from ſuch a diſſection, they eaſily eſteemed for true parts of the Brain; when yet in the mean time, by others from a diſſection otherwiſe made, the parts and proceſſes of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear far different from the former. The reaſon of which is, becauſe the ſubſtance or frame of the Brain and its Appendix lyes ſo within the Skull, that there are many ſwellings or tuberous riſings, with ſeveral tails or little feet compacted together: all which, although diſtinct one from another, and are endued with figures diverſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded; yet they, that they may be contained in a leſſer room, are thruſt as it were into the ſame Globe, and ſo complicated among themſelves, that it is a hard thing to find out where the beginning and end of the Brain, as alſo where the limits and partitions of the near adjoyning parts do remain; further, that the ſeveral parts of the Encephalon ſo complicated, may retain their ſite, nor preſently being looſned one from another, may ſpring forth, they are knit together into due foldings, with Fibres and Membranes ſtretched out from part to part. And as often as the ſubſtance or bulk of the Brain ſo conglobated or rolled together is cut, there is as often a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that the ſlips being cut, the portions of divers parts cleaving together, are carried away with them. Wherefore that a true and genuine deſcription of the Brain might be ſhewed before its ſubſtance and continuity is diſſolved, before all things its whole frame or ſubſtance ought to be explicated, and the knitting of the Membranes being wholly looſned, the ſeveral parts ought to be turned over and ſtretched forth into their proper dimenſions. By what means theſe things may be done, and by what
<pb facs="tcp:152521:126"/>
Method the diſſection or Anatomica adminiſtration of the Brain may be beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, ought here in the firſt place to be ſhewn; then theſe things being firſt done, we will more largely deliver the Deſcription of the Brain, together with the uſe and action of its ſeveral parts.</p>
                           <p>That the perfect knowledge of the Brain and its parts may be gained, it is neceſſary not only to diſſect and look into mens Heads, but all other kind of living Creatures heads: for beſides, that the humane Heads or Bodies are not ſo readily to be had, that one may from day to day behold the Brain and its frame, and carefully conſider the ſituation of the parts, and ſearch one after another their reſpects, habitudes, and dependencies; beſides alſo, the immenſe bulk of an humane Head is in it ſelf an hindrance, whereby its moſt intricate frame and various receſſes and Appendices are the leſs accurately diſcerned and inveſtigated: all which being reduced into an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, are plainly repreſented more commodiouſly in the diſſection of Beaſts. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the form and compoſition of the Brain in a Dog, Calf, Sheep, Hog, and many other four-footed beaſts, were little different (the magnitude only excepted) from the figure of the ſame, and the diſpoſition of the parts, in a man, I was the more ſatisfied to compoſe a certain Anatomy of the Brain by the frequent diſſection of all ſorts of living Creatures. And in this imployment, for that I ſhall ſhew the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities and differences which the ſubjected parts obtain in various Animals, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared among themſelves, and with Man; certainly from ſuch a compared Anatomy, not only the faculties and uſes of every Organ, but the impreſſions, influences, and ſecret ways of working of the ſenſitive Soul it ſelf will be diſcovered. Concerning the Heads of living Creatures, in the diſſection of which it happened for us chiefly to be exerciſed, it was obſerved, as to the chief parts of the Head, that there was a notable Analogy between Man and four-footed Beaſts, alſo between Birds and Fiſhes: For when the firſt Inhabitants of the new-made World were produced, as one day brought forth Fowl and Fiſhes at once, another in like manner Man and four-footed Beaſts; ſo there is in either twin ſpecies a like form of the Brain; but between that Child of the former, and this of the following day, there is found a great difference as to thoſe parts. For as much therefore as Men and four-footed Beaſts have got more perfect Brains, and more alike among themſelves, we have ordered our Obſervations from their Inſpection: Then afterwards we ſhall deliver the Anatomy of the Brain in Fowl and Fiſhes. And here firſt concerning the Heads of Men and four-footed Beaſts, (as we hinted but now) we will propoſe a Method of Diſſection it ſelf, or of Anatomical Adminiſtration, and will at once recite all the parts one after another, and as it were in a compendious Catalogue; then we will by and by more largely draw out the Particles of the Brain and of its Appendix, ſo ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, in a ſhort Table, and will deſign their uſes and actions for the exerciſe of every faculty.</p>
                           <p>When therefore we had in our hands the Head of a Man, or Dog, Calf, or Sheep, its more outward coverings were taken off; concerning which, as they are well enough known, we are not at all ſolicitous: then the covering of the Skull being divided by a Saw or Inſtrument, and taken away, on every ſide the bones are broken off with a pair of Sciſſers or a Penknife to the Baſis of the Skull, that ſo the Contents might, as much as may be, be all made plain or open to the Spectators. What therefore comes firſt in view is the hard Meninx including all the reſt with a common covering. This Membrane outwardly and above is knit to the Skull in divers places, eſpecially about the Sutures; but indeed about the foot or Baſis it moſt ſtrictly cleaves to the bones, ſo that it cannot eaſily be pulled away. Inwardly (or in its hollow ſuperficies) it is lax and looſe enough, unleſs that nigh all its boſoms by the inſertions of the Veins, and in the Baſis of the Skull by the Arteries and the Nerves it is tyed to the <hi>Pia Mater.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This ſame Membrane between the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> or diviſion of the Brain, and beſides of the Cerebel it ſelf inſinuating it ſelf deeply on one ſide, and riſing up again on the other, leaves ſome duplicatures or infoldings, in which, being ſhut up above by the increaſe of the ſame Membrane, Cavities, which they commonly call Boſoms, are formed: to wit, by this means, almoſt the three firſt boſoms are conſtituted; but the fourth is a ſmooth and longiſh, and alſo hollow proceſs of the ſame Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, which is ſent through the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> of the Brain, nigh the end of the callous body, even to the pineal <hi>Glandula.</hi> The Cavities of the greater Boſoms are ſevered in many places, as it were into little Cells; as it ſeems for that end, that the blood
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:152521:126"/>
paſſing ſo through the various turnings in thoſe ends, may be hindred from a more rapid motion.</p>
                           <p>Beſides, this Meninx or Film of the Brain admits two Arteries from either ſide, one conjugation of which ariſes not far from the Carotick Arteries through the holes of the Cuniform bone, but the other from the bone of the Forehead: all which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed being diffuſed through the exteriour ſuperficies of the Membrane, water it; but are terminated, partly in the Skull, eſpecially nigh the Sutures, whither they convey the blood, and partly in the boſoms, where, what is ſuperfluous is laid up. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, theſe Arteries perforate the hard Meninge in ſeveral places on the top of the Brain (as <hi>Webſer</hi> obſerves) and impart ſome ſhoots to the <hi>Pia Mater.</hi> Laſtly, the exteriour ſuperficies of this Meninge is no where planted with ſo many ſhoots of Veins as Arteries; but from its four Boſoms (which are the veinous Receptacles of the blood) many Veins go out through the interiour ſuperficies of this Membrane, which being inſerted in the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> are preſently diſperſed through its whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and the ſame ſliding down on every ſide from the boſoms, meet every where the Arteries aſcending from the Baſis of the Head, and being intermingled with them, conſtitute the manifold infoldings of the Veſſels.</p>
                           <p>That theſe may be the better beheld, after the Arteries are ſufficiently noted, let the hard Meninx be cut round near the border of the broken Skull; then let what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of it ſerves for a covering and partition to the Brain and Cerebel, be lifted up, that the goings out of the Veſſels, <hi>viz.</hi> the Veins and their diſtributions into the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> may be conſidered; which being afterwards broken aſunder, let the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane with its boſoms be wholly taken away; but the reliques of this Membrane, which ſtick to the bones at the bottom of the Skull, ſhould be ſeparated; ſo that the whole frame or ſubſtance of the Brain and its Appendix may be ſomewhat elevated, and moved here and there, be every where conſpicuous, and at length taken from the Skull. But that theſe things may be performed, you muſt begin from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior or fore part, where the bone of the Forehead ſeparates it.</p>
                           <p>Therefore if the prow of the Brain, hid under this bone, be a little lifted up, the mammillary proceſſes come preſently in ſight, together with the ſmelling Nerves hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them; which being diſſected near the inſertion; there will appear an hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in either proceſs. Theſe are large and round, alſo full of clear water in Calves: but in either ſmelling Nerve a manifeſt Cavity is found continued on either ſide to the anterior Ventricles of the Brain, to which if a Pipe be put and blown into, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the whole ſubſtance of the Brain will ſwell.</p>
                           <p>Next the ſmelling Nerves about the Cocks comb two ſmall Arteries are ſeen to ariſe from the Skull, and to be carried towards the <hi>Interſtitium</hi> of the Brain, which in truth are branches of the Carotides, which are knit to the dilated Comb before, and from thence are ſeen to be reflected to the anterior Brain.</p>
                           <p>Theſe Veſſels being there diſſected, the coming together and going out of the Optick Nerves follow, the trunk of which being cut off a little lower, the Tunnel, and out of both its ſides the Arteries called Carotides, ariſing out of the Cuniform-bone, do appear; which are more clearly beheld, if the Brain be lifted up. Theſe alſo being cut off, and the brain farther bent back, the moving Nerves of the Eyes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſhew themſelves; and ſo from thence the other pairs of Nerves follow in order, that one pair of them being cut off, and the brain with its Appendix more lifted up, the next is ſtill obvious to thoſe beholding it, till all the Nerves ariſing within the Skull, and alſo the Arteries, both the Carotides, and the Vertebral being at length cut off, the whole frame of the Head may be taken out of the Skull.</p>
                           <p>But (that theſe Veſſels may be deſcribed in the ſame order as they are met with in the cutting them up) two ſmall Nerves follow after thoſe moving Nerves of the Eyes, which, for a reaſon hereafter rendred, we call Pathetick. Theſe Nerves higher than the reſt, ariſing behind two round Prominences called <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Teſtes,</hi> (the Buttocks and Stones of the Brain) and bending down forward, and entring for a little ſpace under the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> then coming out through the ſame hole, together with the former, from the Skull, are propagated into the ſight of the Eye. This pair is called by <hi>Fallopius</hi> the eighth, by us the fourth.</p>
                           <p>Beneath theſe little Nerves, from both ſides of the annulary protuberance, (which being ſent from the Cerebel compaſſes the oblong Marrow) two Nerves of noted magnitude ariſe, which, after they have paſſed through the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> ſend forth another notable branch on either ſide ſtraight down without the Skull, the other
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:152521:127"/>
branch, by a longer tract, paſſing through both ſides the Skull near the Turky Chair. Theſe Nerves (as is ſhewn afterwards) having gotten a larger Province, are inlarged in the Palate, the parts of the Mouth and Face, and alſo their branches in the Noſe and Eyes, yea they impart roots to the intercoſtal Nerve. We call this pair the fifth, commonly eſteemed the third.</p>
                           <p>Nigh to the beginning of theſe, out of the loweſt foot of the oblong Marrow or Pith, two leſſer Nerves, endued with a ſingle trunk, ariſe, which being dilated for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and preſently entring under the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> come out of the ſame hole with the moving Nerves of the Eyes, and are all carried into the balls of the Eyes. This pair is called by us the ſixth.</p>
                           <p>Next to theſe Nerves follow the auditory or hearing pair, which indeed ariſes higher from the ſides of the oblong Marrow, in what part the Cerebel is hanged to it, <hi>viz.</hi> nigh the leſſer annulary proceſs; from whence it is immediately carried with a double proceſs into the hole of the ſtony Bone: one of its branches is harder, ſerving chiefly for motion; the other altogether medullary and ſofter, as it were only deſtinated to ſenſe.</p>
                           <p>A little lower ariſes the wandring pair, which is commonly called the ſixth. This ſeems to be made of many Nerves, many of which ariſe together; and to them comes another, endued with a greater trunk, which being brought from the end of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long Marrow, yea beyond this, out of the ſpinal Marrow, is united with the former. And ſo all being made like a bundle of Nerves, go out through the hole of the hinder part of the Head; through which alſo goes out the greater branch of the internal ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Vein. This is by us called the eighth pair.</p>
                           <p>Under the wandring pair, almoſt out of the Baſis of the oblong Marrow, another pair ariſes, conſiſting alſo of many Fibres, which going ſtraight down, and being preſently immerſed in the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> comes forth again through a peculiar hole out of the Skull; then either Nerve, being inoculated into the trunk of the wandring pair, is preſently bended back towards the Tongue. In a man, a peculiar protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance grows above the oblong Marrow, out of which the beginning of this Nerve proceeds. This we call the ninth pair.</p>
                           <p>Below this, in the loweſt part of the hinder part of the Head, out of the ſides of the oblong Marrow, where it is about to go into the ſpinal, another pair, conſiſting alſo of many Fibres, ariſes; which tending towards the ſpinal Marrow, enters the <hi>dura Mater</hi> at the ſame place where the vertebral Artery aſcends into the Brain; yet it ariſes out of the boſoms of the bones, but below the firſt Vertebra or Joynt, from whence it is carried into the Muſcles of the hinder part of the Neck, ſo that it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whether this pair ought to be called the laſt of the Skull, or the firſt of the Vertebrals.</p>
                           <p>When theſe parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the aforeſaid Nerves and Arteries, both the Carotides and the Vertebrals, with the jugular Veins (by which the Encephalon is faſtned to the foot or baſis of the Skull) are cut off, and their ends ſtretched out as much as may be; either let them remain in the taken out ſubſtance or frame, whereby the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of all the Nerves may be plainly noted; or the trunks of them being cut off near the roots, may be left in the holes of the Skull, whereby their goings out and diſtributions may be obſerved. The images of either Example are delineated in the firſt and ſecond Table.</p>
                           <p>The buſineſs of Diſſection being thus far brought, the reſidue of the Skull ſhews many things worthy conſideration, of which we ſhall ſpeak particularly afterwards. But firſt we ought to view throughly the taken out frame or ſubſtance of the Brain, together with its Appendix, and to examine all its appearances as they follow in the order of Diſſection.</p>
                           <p>The ſubſtance or bulk being taken out, which is of a ſomewhat round figure or ſpherical, it exhibits to the ſight in its ſuperiour and convex part the Brain and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebel; but the oblong Marrow, with the utmoſt borders or edges of the ſuperiour bodies, poſſeſſes almoſt all the baſis or its loweſt part. The thinner Meninx covers theſe three placed near, and the outward ſuperficies of them all; nor doth it clothe the ſame looſly, but deeply inſinuating it ſelf into all their cavities and receſſes, covers and binds them ſtrictly. And as this Membrane is every where interwoven, with the folds of the Veſſels, by its ſtretching out, it reaches the ſame to every part and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo waters the whole with a ſufficient afflux of blood. Here we muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Veſſels of this Membrane and its protenſion.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="59" facs="tcp:152521:127"/>As to the former, the whole ſuperficies of the frame of the ſubject may be ſeen, covered with the infoldings of Veſſels, as it were with a net admirably variegated or flouriſhed, and its ſight or aſpect ſhews like the picture of a fruit-bearing wood; the Idea of which, the Veſſels of the Brain more aptly repreſent, and are themſelves ſeen better and more diſtinctly, if you firſt ſquirt into the Carotidick Artery ſome black li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. The Veſſels interwoven within the thin Meninge or <hi>Piae Mater</hi> are Arteries and Veins. The Arteries are four, <hi>viz.</hi> two Carotides and two Vertebrals. Out of either ſide of the Tunnel the ends of the cut off Carotidick Arteries ſhew themſelves, the trunks of which aſcending upwards, are preſently diffuſed from either ſide into the anterior and poſterior, or fore and hinder branch. Either pair of theſe inclining one towards the other, are mutually conjoyned: moreover, the poſterior branches ſo joyned, are united with the Vertebral branches (growing together firſt into one trunk.) For the Vertebral Arteries, ariſing from the laſt hole but one of the Skull, fall at firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided through the ſides of the oblong Marrow; then united in its baſis, they go into a ſingle chanel, which meeting with the hinder branches of the Carotides, (as it is ſaid) it is joyned with them; and from that place of the joyning of them together, a noted branch aſcends on either ſide under the edge or rim of the Brain, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dilated upon the ſhanks or ſtocks of the oblong Marrow, is cleft or divided into very many ſmall ſhoots like hairs, ſome of which aſcend to the Glandula's placed behind the Cerebel, but the reſt make the arterious part of the Choroeidal infoldings. The anterior branches of the Carotides, before they are united, ſend from themſelves on either ſide a noted branch, which creeping upwards like a bounding River, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes either Hemiſphere of the Brain as it were into two Provinces; but after the aforeſaid branches are united, preſently departing again from one another, they are carried to the Prow of the Brain, and from thence bending back between its Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres, they fall upon the callous body. All theſe Arteries, before and after their mutual joyning together, ſend forth ſhoots and little branches on every ſide, which do not only creep through and intimately bind about the utmoſt compaſs of its Sphere, but its Penetralia and more inward receſſes, like the young branches of Vines. The ramifications or theſe ſorts of branchings, both of the Carotides and of the Vertebrals, are ſhewn in the firſt Table, as they are found in a Man, and as in a Sheep in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table.</p>
                           <p>Moreover, this thinner Meninx or <hi>Pia Mater</hi> cloathing the whole Brain and its parts, as it receives the Arteries aſcending (as hath been ſaid) from a fourfold Fountain, ſo it is ſtuffed throughout with Veins, ſent from four boſoms. Theſe Veſſels mutually meeting, are complicated together, and almoſt every where conſtitute by their branches derived from both, and meeting one the other, and variouſly contorted among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the net-like or retiform infoldings; which indeed are not only outwardly in the ſuperficies, but in the diſſection, where-ever you may ſeparate one part from another, without breaking it, theſe kind of infoldings of the Veſſels are to be found. Becauſe, if you behold this frame, taken out of the Skull, collecting together the tops of all the turnings and the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> in this Membrane, and covering them with the joynings of the Veſſels, it will make the whole compaſs or frame of the Encephalon appear like a curious quilted ball. But if you go on to caſt abroad this Sphere, and to ſeparate the cleaving parts, knit together, of this Membrane, one from another, you will ſoon find, that this Meninx covers the gapings of the crevices or turning chaps of the Brain, binds the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> of either moity or Hemiſphere, draws together the hinder part of the Brain, otherwiſe being lax and hanging looſe, and compaſſing about every border of it, as it were with a Welt, knits it to the oblong Marrow: and what is the chief of all, the univerſal Cortical or ſhelly ſubſtance of the Brain (to wit, in which the animal Spirits are procreated) is covered over with this Membrane plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with moſt frequent infoldings of the Veſſels; notwithſtanding the interior ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Brain being ſtretched out, (which being called the Callous body, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether medullary and white) is not cloathed with this Membrane; but inſtead of it many foldings of Veſſels, commonly called Choroeides, are hung and as it were freely flow within its complicature. The reaſon of which is, becauſe as this part, to wit, the callous body, is rather deſigned for the Circulation than for the generation of Spirits, therefore it admits not a more plentiful influx of blood: nevertheleſs, for as much as there is need of heat, whereby the Spirits may be there more eaſily circulated, the blood being moved, within the Veſſels hanging there through the empty ſpace, might afford heat as it were from a fire kindled within a Stove. But within all the
<pb facs="tcp:152521:128"/>
other receſſes of the Brain, and beſides within the folds or lappets of the Cerebel, yea and the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> or gaps of both theſe, and of the oblong Marrow, this Meninx inſinuates it ſelf, and inſerts the diſtributions of the Veſſels. In truth, the proten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or out-ſtretching of this Membrane ſeems therefore the more admirable, becauſe having no where a peculiar place of its origine, it not only binds about the Head or Encephalon with a common covering, but alſo cloaths all its parts with proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings, and knits together their tops and proceſſes. Yea this Meninx ſeems to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a manifold and diverſe original: for where-ever the gapings or <hi>Interſtitia</hi> of any parts or proceſſes happen, portions of this Membrane there ſpringing forth, cover them all, and gather them together, and reach to them the ramifications or branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Veſſels. In a moiſter Brain this Meninx may be eaſily ſeparated, and ample and large portions of it pulled away with the fingers; which being drawn away, the inſertions of the Veſſels, into the ſubſtance of the Brain and its Appendix, every where clearly appear. Laſtly, by this means the brain being thus left naked, unclothed of its Membranes and Coverings, its make or fabrick, and the diſpoſition or order of all its parts are next ſubjected to Anatomical Inſpection.</p>
                           <p>That the Anatomy of the Brain, properly ſo called, might be rightly celebrated, I judge we ought not to proceed after the common way of Diſſection. But whenas the ſubſtance of the whole Head, taken out of the Skull, ſtands in view, firſt let the hinder partition of the brain, where it is knit to the Cerebel and oblong Marrow or Pith, the Membranes being every where cut or pulled off, be freed (as much as it may be) from its cleaving to the ſubjected parts; then it will eaſily appear, that the ſubſtance of the brain is not united to thoſe bodies, but of it ſelf is altogether free and independent of them, unleſs where it is joyned towards the ſuperficies by the knitting of the Membranes. Alſo this keel or hinder part of the brain being divided by this means from the neighbouring parts, if the fore part be bent back, the ſhanks of the oblong Marrow will appear wholly naked, and diſtinct from the brain and Cerebel (unleſs where they are in ſome places hung to it.) Moreover, when the partition of the brain, being looſned from its coheſion, is lifted up, the three Ventricles, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſo called, go into one empty ſpace or mere vacuity, reſulting from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the brain. Beſides, it may be obſerved, how the brain before is only united to the oblong Marrow; and that in two places of its ſhanks, as it were the tops, it is fixed; which <hi>Fornix</hi> ſo called, or arched Vault, is as it were a ſtring or ligament, which ariſing before, where the brain is hanging to it, is carried to its hinder border, to which it is united as it were with two ſtretched out arms, and ſo it holds together the whole frame of the brain, leſt it be rolled out into a plain, ſtill in a ſpherical figure, and firmly binds the ſame to the ſhanks of the oblong Marrow. From the knitting of the other parts of the humane brain divided and lifted upwards, whereby the vacuity reſulting from its infolding, and eſteemed for Ventricles, alſo whereby the <hi>Fornix</hi> or arched Vault and ſhanks of the oblong Marrow, naked and diſtinct, may be beheld, is repreſented by figure in the fourth Table.</p>
                           <p>And truly, this Poſition or Aſpect of the Brain, to wit, when its hinder border or partition, being freed from its coheſion by the Membranes to the oblong Marrow, and elevated, is bent forward, expoſes to be ſeen by the eyes themſelves, its whole frame or ſubſtance, to wit, whatever it hath without or within, or before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and alſo plainly detects what its habitude and reſpect is to the other parts. The chief things of theſe I ſhall add, and in the ſame order wherein they occurred to Inſpection.</p>
                           <p>The figure of the Brain, eſpecially in a man, ſhews ſomewhat globous or ſpherical: the outward ſuperficies is on all ſides noted with chinks turning and winding like to the rollings about of the Inteſtines: each breach or involution, yea the whole circuit of it contains a twofold ſubſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> the Cortical or rindy, which is the outmoſt and of an Aſh-colour; and the medullary or marrowy, which lyes under it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears white. The brain being as it were plowed with theſe kind of rollings about, like ſo many ridges and furrows, is cleft in the middle, and parted as it were into two Hemiſpheres; yet both the moities come together, and are as it were founded in one like white ſubſtance, which covers inwardly, and as it were in Chambers or Vaults, the whole bulk of the brain. This is harder than any other portion of the brain, and as it is altogether medullary, it receives all the marrows of the circumvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions within it ſelf, and is to them inſtead of a common baſis. In either Hemiſphere of the brain, about the fore parts, this callous body or marrowy ſubſtance, becomes
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:152521:128"/>
more firm and thick by far than in any other place; and there it is on both ſides faſtned to the tops of the oblong Marrow. From thoſe tops, as it were its beginning, this medullary ſubſtance, covering over or chambering or arching the brain, is ſtretched out towards the hinder parts, and by degrees leſſens in its thickneſs: at length the outward border of this ſtretched out, is drawn together more narrowly, and more below, it is conjoyned by the knitting of the Membranes and Veſſels (as we but now mentioned) to the tail of the oblong Marrow. Beſides, for its more firm connexion, a medullary proceſs ariſes from the fore part of the callous body to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the tops of it, which ſtretching under the fiſſure or cleft of the brain, reaches to its border; to which it is united, as it were with arms bending on either ſide: which arms indeed embrace the tail of the oblong Marrow, and ſo more firmly knit to it that border of the brain.</p>
                           <p>This medullary proceſs, commonly called the <hi>Fornix,</hi> under its riſe or beginning, hath two white and medullary roots, either of them alike going out from the callous body, which roots nigh the tops, where the brain is hung to them, meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, paſs into the <hi>Fornix</hi> or Vault it ſelf, as if it were a broad proceſs, which ſtretches under the chamber of the brain, like a beam. Under this twofold root of the <hi>Fornix</hi> is laid croſs-wiſe, of the ſame magnitude, a medullary trunk, by which, like a bridge, there is a certain paſſage and communication between two proceſſes of the form of a Lentil, and chamfer'd or furrowed bodies beaming or ſhining in them. Further, from the midſt of the ſuperficies of this <hi>Fornix,</hi> a thin and pellucid hedge or pale is erected, which is affixed to the chanel or furrow of the callous body, almoſt along its whole paſſage. And for this reaſon, whilſt the three-ſided <hi>Fornix</hi> ſtretched underneath a chamber, ariſing from the complication of the brain, it diſtinguiſhed its appearing cavity as it were into three partitions, and ſo cauſed, that in it three Ventricles were repreſented.</p>
                           <p>The interior receſſes of the Brain will lye yet more clearly open, if the border, being on every ſide ſeparated and lifted up, as much as may be, from its cohering with the oblong Marrow, be cut a little further through the ſubſtance at the ſides of the ſame Marrow, to which it is united, nigh the chamfer'd bodies, and alſo the <hi>Fornix,</hi> being cut nigh the roots, be bent back, together with the brain; for then the frame of the brain may be wholly lifted up, turned forward, and unfolded into a plain, ſo that the whole interior ſuperficies of the callous body being ſtretched out into a broad floor, may be ſeen and handled. Where, beſides the medullary, and its moſt white ſubſtance, may be obſerved many white parallel lines, which cut the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the brain in right angles, as if they were certain tracts or footſteps, in which the animal Spirits travel from one Hemiſphere of the brain to the other, and return back again.</p>
                           <p>After this manner, in very many perfect four-footed Beaſts, the frame or ſubſtance of the brain was wont to be turned over, the Sphere being projected into a plain, and its interior ſuperficies to be unfolded into breadth. Alſo this kind of Method of Diſſection may be uſed in a mans brain, where the ſame Phaenomena wholly occur to Anatomical obſervation. The chief difference is, that the bulk of the brain of a man, for that it is very large, and alſo far thicker, and endued with more turnings and windings; therefore it cannot be ſo eaſily and throughly inverted, as that of a Calf or Sheep, and reduced into a broad plain: yet it may be ſo far expanded and lifted up near its border or partition, that all the interior receſſes may appear in view. The third and fourth Figures ſhew the image of an humane brain bent back: but in the ſeventh Table is ſhewn the aſpect or ſight of a Sheeps brain wholly unfolded, and as it were ſpread plain.</p>
                           <p>In the leſſer four footed Beaſts, as a Mouſe, an Hare, Coney, and ſome others, the ſuperficies of the brain being wholly plain or even, wants the turnings and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; however from the complication of the border, and the under-ſtretching of the <hi>Fornix,</hi> there reſults a cavity repreſenting Ventricles.</p>
                           <p>After that we have throughly viewed all things which belong to the Brain, in the order as we have ſaid, let either Hemiſphere, covered within with the callous body, by which it hangs, be divided and removed from the tops of the oblong Marrow: which indeed may be exactly done, by cutting it near to the ſides of the Lentiform prominencies, which are found in the vulgar diſſection of the Head, within the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Ventricles: for thoſe prominences are the tops or heights of the ſhanks of the oblong Marrow, to which the callous body is immediately fixed. When the brain
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:152521:129"/>
is cut after this manner, that the prominencies, which are the tops of the ſhanks of the oblong Marrow, may be left naked, let them be cut long ways through the midſt (to wit, in the medullary part, where they are conjoyned to the callous body) and their interior ſubſtance will appear through the whole chamfered or ſtreaked; <hi>viz.</hi> medullary ſtreaks or chamferings are ſeen to aſcend and deſcend forward and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; that none may doubt, but that theſe chamferings or ſtreaks were made by Nature, as it were paſſages or chanels for the paſſage and return, or going to and fro of the Spirits out of the callous body into the oblong Marrow, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. The Figure of the ſhanks of the oblong Marrow, divided from the Brain, with their tops, which are the chamfered bodies, is expreſſed in the eighth Table.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The Parts of the oblong Marrow, and the reſt of the hinder Parts of the Head are recounted, and their Diſſection ſhewn.</head>
                           <p>HAving deſcribed both the Meninges, and the ramifications of the Veſſels in them, alſo the fabrick of the Brain, properly ſo called; and next ſhewed its outward partition gathered together into folds about the ſhanks of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long Marrow, and either middle or marrowy part of it hung to the chamfered bodies; we will now follow the remaining parts of the Head in order.</p>
                           <p>The chamfered or ſtreaked bodies, or the tops of the oblong Marrow, are two lentiform Prominences, which are beheld within the former Ventricles of the Brain, as they are commonly termed; the heads of theſe, which are more large and blunt, incline mutually one to another, and are almoſt contiguous. Out of the angle of this inclination the <hi>Fornix</hi> ariſes with a double root; to which is ſubjected or underlaid a certain tranſverſe medullary proceſs, and ſeems to knit together theſe ſtreaked bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as may be ſeen in the ſeventh Table GG: but the ends of thoſe bodies, being made ſharper, are reflected outward, and make as it were two ſides, with a ſharp triangle, to whoſe anterior ſuperficies the marrow of the callous body ſticks for a long tract; where, if theſe bodies be cut long-ways through the midſt, the medullary ſtreaks (as was already ſaid) will preſently appear. The figure and place of theſe, as alſo the medullary chamferings, are truly repreſented in the eighth Table.</p>
                           <p>Where the ſtreaked bodies end, the chambers or <hi>Thalami,</hi> as they are termed, of the optick Nerves, poſſeſs the next part to the oblong marrow; to wit, in this place,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:152521:132"/>
its ſhanks riſe into unequal protuberances, out of the ridges of which the Optick Nerves ariſe, and from thence, being bent down in the fore-part with a certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, they joyn together about the baſe of the ſame marrow, and ſeem to be united; by and by being again parted, and going forward towards the ball of the Eye, they go out of the Skull. In this place the ſhanks of the oblong marrow in a Man are for the moſt part diſtinct, and gaping one from another, leave a deſcending opening, which is the paſſage to the Tunnel; but in moſt four-footed Beaſts the ſhanks of the ſame medullary ſtocks are there diſtinct, only a little lower, and have a chink cut for the Tunnel: but the ridges of them, in which the beginnings of the Optick Nerves lye hid, are ſomewhat conjoyned, and for the ſpace of half an inch do grow together. Wherefore in Brutes there is one hole before this growing together, and another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it, both which lead towards the Tunnel. The reaſon of this difference is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in a Man, for that the frame or ſubſtance of the brain it ſelf is very large, and that its marrowy parts are remote one from another, it is behoveful for its ſhanks, whereby the tops of the oblong marrow may be the better fitted to the ſame, to be ſeparated, and from their mutual touching to be bent into a greater aperture. Hence it is obſerved, that in a Man the ſhanks of the oblong marrow, from the hanging on of the brain, go forward with a greater angle of inclination, and with a certain bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compaſs; but in Brutes the ſame lye almoſt parallel. After what manner theſe parts are formed in an humane brain the third and fourth Figure ſhews; after what manner they are in four footed Beaſts is ſhewn in the ſeventh Figure.</p>
                           <p>From the ſame ridges of the medullary ſhanks, from whence the Optick Nerves take their origines, certain medullary proceſſes ariſing, and being dilated on either ſide above the brim of the ſecond hole, grow together about the root of the pineal Glandula. Theſe proceſſes (as it ſeems) are thoſe parts, which the Famous <hi>Cartes</hi> ſuppoſes to be Nerves belonging to the pineal Glandula: but I rather ſuſpect them to be productions only, by which the Optick Nerves may alſo communicate near their origines. Their figure is very well deſcribed in the ſeventh Table.</p>
                           <p>After the <hi>Thalami</hi> or Chambers of the Optick Nerves, other notable protuberances, commonly called <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Teſtes,</hi> the Buttocks and Teſticles (of the brain) grow to the ſuperior part of the medullary Trunk or ſtem, and cover its ſuperficies about the ſpace of an inch; and for that they are not contiguous in the midſt, there is under them a certain hollowneſs in their whole tract. Theſe protuberances are leſſer in a Man, alſo in a Dog and Cat; laſtly, if we obſerved rightly, in other living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which are newly brought forth, that are impotent, and not inſtructed for the finding out of food. In a Calf, Sheep, Hog, and the like, they appear far greater: in Fiſhes and Fowls they are wholly wanting.</p>
                           <p>In number they are four, <hi>viz.</hi> two grow to either ſide of the oblong marrow. The former called <hi>Nates</hi> or the Buttocks, ſeem the greater and principal; to which the other latter called <hi>Teſtes</hi> or the Teſticles, hang as if growing out of them. As to their figure, they are round, and are commonly taken for two ſhanks on either ſide of the brain and Cerebel planted near, which being bent inwardly, and turned back one towards the other, are ſaid to grow together, and ſo to conſtitute the oblong marrow. But this opinion, as we ſhall ſhew more largely hereafter, by the diſſection ordered according to our Method, is clearly falſe. For it plainly appears, that the brain is fixed, long before theſe bodies, to the oblong marrow; nor is there any commerce between theſe and that, unleſs very remote.</p>
                           <p>But if the ſite of theſe parts, and their reſpects and habitudes to the neighbouring bodies, be well noted, it will appear plainly, that they make as it were a certain peculiar Region wholly diſtinct from the Brain and Cerebel, alſo from the oblong marrow it ſelf. Their ſituation is remote enough from the fore-parts, and ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparated by the Cavity or Ventricle under-lying from the medullary ſtock or ſtem: yea a proper way, or one proceſs, ſeems to lead from the long marrow into theſe prominences, and another to go from them, and thence to be carried into the Cerebel. From hence we may ſuſpect, that theſe prominences (eſpecially the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, or of the ſhape of a Buttock, which are the chief) are certain places of diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in which the animal Spirits go apart in their paſſage from the oblong marrow into the Cerebel, and from this to that on the other ſide, and there ſtay for ſome animal uſes, of which we ſhall ſpeak hereafter. As to the way, which leads from the oblong marrow into theſe prominences; it is manifeſt, that beneath the origines of the Optick Nerves on either ſide a medullary Proceſs deſcends, with little Villages
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:152521:132"/>
proper for it ſelf, which terminates in the aforeſaid prominencies. Then, if from theſe, you look for a paſſage out, it is equally clear, that from the hindermoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minences, which are called <hi>Teſtes,</hi> on either ſide, a medullary proceſs doth obliquely aſcend, which being dilated into the Cerebel, is divaricated through its whole frame. But that the Natiform or Buttock-formed Prominences are Principals, and the <hi>Teſtes</hi> their dependences, or the heads of medullary Proceſſes, which are carried from thence into the Cerebel, manifeſtly appears in a Sheep, Calf, or Horſe, and in ſome others, where the <hi>Nates</hi> are of a noted magnitude, the <hi>Teſtes</hi> of a very ſmall bulk grow to them, and in the middle between theſe the medullary Proceſſes, the Appendices of the former Prominences, exiſt. The aforeſaid Prominences, as alſo the medullary Proceſſes, which lead forward and backward, to and from them, are aptly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the fourth Table, but yet more clearly in the eighth Table TT.

                           <p>Further, becauſe the animal Spirits reſiding in either Promptuary and Appendix, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are carried to the Brain, ought to be confounded and mingled together, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the two prominences of either ſide do mutually grow together as it were with wings ſtretched out one to another; but for as much as it is behoveful for thoſe grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings together to be diſtinguſhed from the oblong marrow, therefore an hollowneſs comes between, which is by ſome eſteemed the fourth Belly, and by others a paſſage to it. Theſe prominences in a Man, Dog, and Cat, and ſome other Animals (as was above mentioned) are very ſmall, and almoſt even; alſo they appear, as the other portion of the oblong marrow, of a white colour. In a Calf, Sheep, Horſe, and many other four-footed Beaſts, the former protuberances, commonly called <hi>Nates</hi> or Buttocks, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably great, alſo outwardly they appear to be of a fleſh colour, becauſe they are cloathed with the thin Meninx or <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> which contains in it ſelf very many Veins and Arteries; which if ſeparated, the interior ſubſtance of thoſe parts is of a wanniſh colour, and ſuch as is not in all the oblong marrow or pith beſides. But it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, as in Brutes, ſo in Man, the hinder or poſterior prominences are Epiphyſes or additions of the former, and that from theſe additions or dependences the medullary proceſſes aſcend obliquely into the Cerebel; near which, other proceſſes cutting thoſe, deſcend direct from the Cerebel, which ſeem not to be inſerted into the medullary Trunk, but going about it, do conſtitute the annulary or ringy protuberance. This annulary protuberance is greater in a Man than in any other Creature. Beſides, it is obſerved, that where-ever the ſuperior prominence of the Buttock-form is larger, this inferior annulary is very ſmall; and ſo on the contrary. Further, thoſe medul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary proceſſes, aſcending towards the Cerebel, communicate mutually among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the other tranſverſe medullary proceſs; and out of this tranſverſe proceſs, two ſmall little Nerves ariſe, the fourth pair of thoſe which we have recounted, and which are called by us Pathetical. Each of theſe, delineated in fit figures, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Table ſhews clear enough.</p>
                           <p>Not far from the aforeſaid Prominences, to wit, between theſe and the Chink, which is called the <hi>Anus</hi> or Arſe-hole, the Pineal Glandula or Kernel is placed. This is put in a Valley, which lyes between the Natiform protuberances, and thoſe which are the Chambers or <hi>Thalami</hi> of the Optick Nerves; in which place that Glandula or Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel is fixed, ſometimes by very many ſmall Fibres, and ſometimes by two noted me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullary roots ſubjected to the part; and beſides, it is included in a Membrane, which is a portion of the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> as in a Cheſt; and as this Membrane is ſtuffed with very many Arteries and Veins, ſome ſmall Veſſels alſo enter into this Glandula.</p>
                           <p>Under the Prominences but now deſcribed, (as was above hinted) a narrow Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity or Ventricle is ſtretched out with a long paſſage, which, although it obtains ſome egregious uſes, yet it ſelf ſeems to be only ſecondary, and as it were by chance; for that the proceſſes of either prominence ought to be conjoyned among themſelves, and to be diſtinguiſhed from the under-lying medullary Trunk. Two holes lye open into this Trunk, one of which is placed in the beginning, and the other in the end of it, and through the middle of its paſſage the down-bending aperture tends towards the Tunnel; ſo that the ſerous humor entring at either hole, may preſently ſlide away into the Tunnel. Moreover, into the ſame aperture of the Tunnel there lyes open another paſſage, to wit, through the firſt hole, which is placed near the roots of the <hi>Fornix;</hi> ſo that from every quarter of the Head the ſeroſities might be carried into that ſink: to wit, that through the firſt hole, from the infoldings or the anterior Ventricles of the Brain; through the ſecond hole, the humors which are gathered about the orbicular prominences, do come away; and through the third hole, thoſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:152521:133"/>
which are laid up high the confines of the Cerebel, do find a paſſage. Theſe ſeveral holes, with the diſtinct ways to the Tunnel, are plainly delineated in the ſeventh Table H. M. T.</p>
                           <p>Above the Pineal Kernel, as it were above the Button, the infolding of the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roeides ſeems to be hung; now this infolding is made after this manner: out of either ſide of the oblong marrow, where the border of the brain is knit to it, two Arteries ariſing from the poſterior branches of the Carotides, where they are united to the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebrals, do directly aſcend; which being preſently divided, like many Rivers planted near together, are carried towards the pineal Glandula, and there ſeem to be termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by a mutual meeting: and in that place, out of the fourth boſom, ſent down upon the pineal Glandula, the veinous branches come out on both ſides, which in like manner being divided into filaments or ſmall threads, meet with the capillary or hairy Arteries, and are in many places inoculated into them, and variouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with them; and ſo theſe Veſſels, being Net-like, much interwoven among themſelves, and interſerted with the Glandula's, do conſtitute the to be admired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foldings. Theſe kind of infoldings of the Veſſels, as it were with two out-ſtretched wings, are thruſt out on either ſide upon the ſhanks of the oblong marrow, even to the ſtreaked bodies; but yet they only lye upon their ſuperficies, nor are they more firmly affixed either to the oblong marrow, or to the callous body by any inſertions of the Veſſels; ſo that the blood ſeems only to be brought to theſe places, and carried away without any afflux of it made into the ſubjected parts; for what uſes ſhall be ſpoken of hereafter. The Choroidal infoldings, with the pineal Glandula, are drawn out in the ſeventh Table G. F. E.</p>
                           <p>And thus far concerning the appearances found above the oblong Marrow, between the ſtreaked bodies and the Cerebel; which indeed are almoſt conſtantly after a like manner both in Man and four-footed Beaſts, unleſs that they only differ in bigneſs. Within this ſpace, in the Pedeſtal or Baſis of the ſame Marrow, many things worth noting occur: For beſides the ends of the cut off Veſſels, which are above recited, the ſite and ſtructure of the Infundible or Tunnel deſerve conſideration. For behind the coalition or joyning together of either Optick Nerve between the ſhanks of the oblong marrow there gaping, is ſent down a receptacle as it were tubulated or made like a Pipe, covered without with a thin Membrane ariſing from the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> and defended within with a medullary ſubſtance. The orifice of this is placed higher be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſhanks of the oblong marrow, and receives their bending aperture; from thence a ſhort Tube or Pipe being ſent down, is inſerted to the pituitary Glandula or Kernel. We ſee this Tube in an Horſes brain greater than a Gooſes quill, alſo ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and full of clear water; that it is not to be doubted, but that by this way the ſerous humors ſlide away from the brain to the pituitary Glandula: but how theſe humors are carried away from thence, ſhall be afterwards inquired into, becauſe they are not carried into the Palate or roof of the mouth, as is commonly believed.</p>
                           <p>Nigh the lower border of the Tunnel, in a Man, underneath there are two whitiſh Glandula's; though in Brutes only one, but greater, is found. What is the proper uſe of this part ſhall be told hereafter: in the mean time, whether it be doubled or only one larger, it ſeems to be as it were inſtead of a bank to defend or preſerve the thin Membrane of the Tunnel, leſt it ſhould be broken or thruſt out of its place: on the other ſide the growing together of the Optick Nerves ſerves inſtead of the ſame kind of defence.</p>
                           <p>What beſides is contained in this ſpace are only the ſhanks of the oblong marrow it ſelf, which proceed directly from the chambers of the Optick Nerves towards the hinder part of the Head in a ſtraight paſſage; and when both grow together below the Tunnel, they are afterwards diſtinguiſhed in their whole tract by a line drawn through the midſt. Theſe ſhanks of a mans brain are far larger than in brute beaſts: to wit, in that they ſeem to be made up of very many medullary chords or ſtrings joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one, as if in this common paſſage and high-way of the animal Spirits, they were ſo many diſtinct paths, which the Spirits enter into reſpectively, according to the various impulſes of ſenſe and local motion. Moreover, this ſpace of the oblong marrow therefore appears ſhorter and more broken in a man, becauſe much of it is hid by the annulary protuberance, which is ſent from the Cerebel, and is very big. The <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> all about covering the ſides of this medullary Trunk, cloaths them with moſt thick infoldings of the Veſſels; by which heat and the nervous juyce are carried, as a continual proviſion for the Spirits, taking a long journey. Thus much
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:152521:133"/>
for the firſt Section, or anterior portion of the oblong marrow: now our order car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries us to the inſpection of its hinder Region, to wit, where the Cerebel grows to it; and the Proceſſes ſent from this either compaſs about its Trunk, or are inſerted into it; out of which alſo, the other Nerves produced within the Skull, take their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings. Concerning theſe we will ſpeak in order.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> A Deſcription of the Cerebel and its Proceſſes, alſo of the hinder Region of the oblong Marrow.</head>
                           <p>BElow the orbicular Prominences, the Cerebel follows to be inſpected. The figure of this, like the Brain, is ſomewhat globous, alſo it appears unequal, marked with certain turnings and windings about; the ridges and furrows of whoſe turnings about the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> ſtretches over, and reaches out the infoldings of the Veſſels to them all, and deeply inſerts them into all. However the Cerebel is diverſified or variegated with its turnings and rollings about, not as the Brain, after an uncertain manner; but its folds are diſpoſed in a certain orderly ſeries; for the exterior frame of it ſeems to conſiſt of thin lappets, or little rings or circles, being contiguous and infolded, alſo going about through the whole compaſs with a parallel ſite or ſituation.</p>
                           <p>Either Region of the Cerebel, to wit, the former and the hinder, is terminated in a proceſs in form of a Worm. According to theſe ends, as it were in a double Pole, theſe Circles are very ſhort; thence aſcending towards the top or Equator, they are by degrees enlarged, as it were Parallels in a Sphere or Globe. Theſe Circles are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly Cortical or barky, and within medullary, and all their marrowy parts paſs into two ample middles; which indeed ſeem to be the ſame in the Cerebel, as the callous body in the brain.</p>
                           <p>The Cerebel in ſome Animals conſiſts of one frame, and all its little circles are placed in the ſame parallel ſite, and keep the ſame proportion among themſelves; but in others there grow to the Cerebel as it were the primary Sphere, and endued with greater circles, ſome other bodies as it were Wens or Extuberances, or additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spheres marked with leſſer circles. Theſe being eccentrick to the Cerebel it ſelf, have oftentimes labels or folds ordered in a diverſe ſeries from it.</p>
                           <p>But the Cerebel it ſelf (whether it hath theſe little Excreſcences growing to it or not) is found almoſt in all Animals of the ſame figure and proportion, alſo made up of the ſame kind of labels or lappets. Thoſe which have the brain diverſly framed from a Mans, as Fowl and Fiſhes, alſo among four-legged Creatures, Conies and Mice, whoſe brains want turnings about or convolutions, have the like ſpecies and the like diſpoſition of the folds and compoſure of the other parts of the Cerebel. The reaſon of this difference in the brain, and of the conformity in the Cerebel, is rendred hereafter, when we treat of the Uſe of the Parts.</p>
                           <p>As the Brain, within its Cavity, hath the Choroidal infolding made up of Arteries and Velſis variouſly complicated, and of Glandula's thickly interſerted; ſo alſo the Cerebel hath got the like infoldings of Veſſels, and thoſe marked with very many Glandula's, and greater than thoſe in the Choroidal infolding. Theſe infoldings and heap of Kernels, the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> being ſeparated, which clothes the hinder part of the Cerebel, eaſily appear in ſight; for in that place theſe creep upwards on either ſide nigh the Worm-ſhaped proceſs, as it were with two branches; and receive the Artery on either ſide, from the Vertebral Artery, lying under the Baſis of the oblong mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and the veinous paſſages, ſent from either lateral boſom. We ſhall inquire here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after into the uſe of this Infolding and of its Glandula's.</p>
                           <p>In the mean time, that we may deſcribe the ſite and hanging on of the Cerebel; the ſame ſtanding on the oblong marrow ſeems to be fixed to its ſides, as it were by two little feet; between which, planted on either ſide, and the Cerebel placed above, and the trunk of the long marrow below, (becauſe all theſe ſhould be diſtinct one from the other) there comes a cavity or hollowneſs between, which is commonly called the four Bellies.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="68" facs="tcp:152521:134"/>In either little foot, ſuſtaining the Brain, are found three diſtinct medullary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes. The firſt of theſe, ſent from the orbicular Protuberances, aſcends obliquely; the ſecond deſcending ſtraight from the Cerebel, and paſſing through the other acroſs, compaſſes about the oblong marrow; the third proceſs, deſcending from the hinder Region of the Cerebel, is inſerted into the oblong marrow, and increaſes its trunk as it were with an additional cord or ſtring. Theſe ſeveral Proceſſes are truly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the ſeventh Table Q. P. R.</p>
                           <p>But as to what belongs to the annular or ringy Protuberance, by which the medul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Trunk, both in Man, and in ſome four-footed Beaſts, is compaſſed about, that is made after this manner. The ſecond or middle proceſs of the Cerebel, deſcending ſtraight to the oblong marrow, ſeems not to be implanted in it, aſſoon as it touches its ſides, but growing into a larger bulk, goes about the ſuperficies of the ſame marrow with divers circular Fibres. And ſo when in either ſide both thoſe kind of proceſſes of the Cerebel, being dilated or carried from the top of the medullary Trunk toward its Baſis, do mutually meet, they make that circular protuberance. The ſubſtance of this is far larger in a Man than in any other Animal; in an Hare, Rabbet, Mouſe, and the like, it is very ſmall; in Fowl it is either wholly wanting, or for its ſmalneſs ſcarce to be diſcerned by the eyes. Concerning its bulk, this is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant obſervation. They who have the orbicular prominences before the Cerebel ſmall, have this annulary protuberance very big; and on the contrary, they who have thoſe prominences big or very great, have this ring very ſmall: further, they who wholly want the Buttock form protuberances, as in Fowl, ſeem alſo to want this annulary.</p>
                           <p>In many brute Animals, but not in Man, nigh to this greater Protuberance, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lower, another leſſer, in like manner orbicular, ſtands, and compaſſeth about the ſuperficies of the oblong marrow; the root of which is a white and medullary line, ſtretched out under the Cerebel, above the bottom of the fourth Ventricle. From the ſides of this leſſer protuberance the auditory Nerves ariſe: In Man the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or hearing Nerves are ſeen to ariſe out of the utmoſt brim of the greater protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance, in like manner they have for their root a white medullary line covering the fourth Ventricle.</p>
                           <p>That this line, and the three diſtinct medullary Proceſſes, which conſtitute either little foot of the Cerebel, may be more plainly ſhewn, alſo that the moſt inward frame of the Cerebel may be viewed, its whole globe ought to be cut through both Poles, <hi>viz.</hi> in the middle through the Vermiform or Worm-ſhaped proceſſes; then it will plainly appear, that in either Hemiſphere there is an ample middle or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, wherein the marrowy branches, being ſtretched abroad on every ſide, like thoſe of a tree, ſpread through the Cortical ſubſtance of the Cerebel, every where diffuſed; and that in either middle or marrowy part, the three diſtinct proceſſes, which make either trunk, or little foot of the Cerebel, are inſerted. Each of theſe are fitly repreſented in the ſeventh Table.</p>
                           <p>Thus much for the Cerebel, and by what means it is faſtned to the oblong marrow. Beſide theſe, it is to be obſerved, that about the bottom of the Baſis of the oblong marrow, out of the greater Ring, come out two medullary ſtrings, which being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the reſt of the medullary Trunk, go right forward towards the ſpinal marrow, and in its progreſs, being made ſtraiter by degrees, like Pyramids, after about the ſpace of an inch, end in ſharp points. The extremities of theſe conſiſt on the other ſide, where the wandring pair of Nerves have their orignal, and make a certain riſing up in the oblong marrow. Hence it is likely, that theſe ſtrings are paſſages or chanels of the animal Spirits, wherein they are carried from the greater Ring, or what is the ſame thing, from the Cerebel into the wandring pair, and the beginnings of other Nerves implanted near; for what end, ſhall be ſaid hereafter. Theſe pyramidal Bodies do not ſo manifeſtly appear ſo long as the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> clothes them, and hides them with the infoldings of the Veſſels; but this Membrane being pulled away, they are ſo conſpicuous, eſpecially in a Man and a Dog, that they ſeem like greater Nerves. In thoſe Animals, where the annulary Protuberance is greater, theſe proceſſes being brought from the ſame in right angles, are greater and more conſpicuous; and on the contrary, in Fowl they are clearly wanting.</p>

                           <p>Theſe are the Phaenomena or Appearances which the whole frame of the Brain and its Appendix is wont to exhibit to Anatomical Inſpection, and which, as to its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, and all its parts, and proceſſes, are to be found both within and without. As it is a hard and troubleſom buſineſs to inquire into the actions and uſe of each of theſe, ſo it is alſo joyned with ſo much pleaſure and profit, that I dare promiſe to my ſelf and others, that it will be a thing worth our labour and while. Yet before we enter upon this, there remain to be unfolded ſome things hid in ſome of the bones of the Skull, ſuch as are the pituitary Kernels, the admirable Net, and ſome others; alſo we ought to ſhew firſt, briefly at leaſt, a type or figure of the Brains in Fowl and Fiſhes.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> The Parts and ſome of the Contents of the ſeparated Skull unfolded.</head>
                           <p>IT is not our intent, nor will it be needful for us to delineate the figures and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſeveral Bones of the Brain-pan, or to deſcribe their various holes, which tranſmit the Trunks of the Veſſels like the hanging weights of a Clock. All theſe are well enough known; ſo that to treat of theſe Gates or Entries is ſuperfluous. Beſides alſo, by what means the Nerves, ariſing within the Skull with their ramifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or branching forth, enter the dens and caverns of the Bones, ſhall be delivered particularly afterwards. Wherefore for the preſent our buſineſs ſhall be only to take notice of ſome things, chiefly worth noting, concerning the ſanguiferous Veſſels paſſing through the Cuniform or Wedge-like Bone, not ſufficiently noted by others.</p>
                           <p>Among the various uſes and offices which the Cuniform or Wedge-like Bone yields to the Brain and its Appendix, it is not of the leaſt note or moment, that it tranſmits the Carotidick Arteries, not without a certain mechanical or artificial proviſion; and that in the middle way, by which they muſt paſs, it contains the pituitary Kernel, and ſometimes the wonderful Net. Each of theſe deſerve conſideration; the more, for that in divers Animals they are after a different manner; and becauſe it is much controverted among Phyſicians concerning their frame and uſe. But we will firſt ſpeak of the pituitary Glandula, becauſe this part, being placed higher, is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Anatomical Inſpection before others.</p>
                           <figure>
                              <head>Fig. IIII</head>
                              <figDesc>brain of a foolish youth</figDesc>
                           </figure>
                           <p>This Glandula is found in all perfect Creatures; for Man, all four-footed Beaſts, yea Fowl and Fiſhes are provided or endued with it: from whence we may conclude it to have ſome neceſſary uſes in the Brain. But as to its quantity or bigneſs, its proportion is various in divers Animals, according to the bigneſs of the head and body wherein it is; becauſe in a Lamb it is greater than in a Man or a Dog; alſo its bulk in a Horſe is leſſer than in an Ox. But the reaſon of this difference ſeems to conſiſt in this chiefly, for that the pituitary Glandula in ſome, reſpects the bulk of the brain only laid upon it, and in others both the brain and the Carotidick Arteries aſcending near it; and ſo as it hath a reſpect to both theſe together, or only to one, its ſubſtance or bulk is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greater or leſſer. For truly in ſome Animals the Carotidick Arteries being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated within the Skull, are preſently divaricated into Net-like infoldings, and from thoſe infoldings many ſhoots of the Veſſels every where enter this Glandula, and are interwoven into its ſubſtance. Further, becauſe this infolding of the Veſſels, called the wonderful Net, is found very large in ſome, and in others very ſmall; therefore this Kernel, for as much as it admits from theſe, few branches, and from thoſe far more, and in ſome other Animals ſcarce any ſhoots from the Arteries, anſwers to this divers diſtributions of the Veſſels, with the various proportion of its bulk. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is obſerved in ſome Animals, as chiefly in a Man and a Horſe, that this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Net is wholly wanting; and whereas in ſuch, either Artery is carried about by a long compaſs between the receſſes of this bone; from its trunk in a man ſometimes one or two ſhoots, ſometimes none, are carried into the pituitary Kernel; alſo in an Horſe fewre branches enter into it, and ſo its bulk in theſe becomes leſſer.</p>
                           <p>But in very many other Animals (eſpecially thoſe who have the wonderful Net) it may be proved, beſides ocular inſpection, alſo by this Experiment, that many ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiferous Veſſels enter this Glandula: for if an inky liquor be ſquirted into the Caroti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des with a Syringe, the exterior part of the Glandula, that is interwoven with the blood-carrying Veſſels, will be very much dyed with a black colour. Wherefore without doubt, it may be thought, that this Glandula doth receive into it ſelf the humors, to wit, flowing into it from the Tunnel in all kind of living Creatures, and in ſome from the branches of the Carotides. Yet by which way theſe humors are carried away again, doth not ſo plainly appear; for we affirm, with the moſt Learned <hi>Schneider,</hi> that they do not at all fall down into the Palate through the holes of the under-lying bone. Yet in the mean time, we ſuppoſe thoſe holes to be only made to procure lightneſs to the bone; becauſe in thoſe Animals, which have the greater pituitary Kernel, thoſe holes in the bone are more and larger: further, I have often found veſſels or chanels to be contained between thoſe holes: and when I had injected Ink within the great hole of the ſame bone in a Calf, the black liquor preſently entred the leſſer Veſſels ſubject to the bone, and at laſt the Jugular Vein. And by this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment chiefly we conjecture concerning the office and duty of this Glandula; of which we ſhall ſpeak more fully hereafter, when we inquire into the uſe of this and the Tunnel.</p>
                           <p>Nigh to either ſide of the pituitary Kernel, if the <hi>dura Mater</hi> be opened, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotidick Artery lyes ſtretched out upon the wedge-like bone, about the length of an inch: for as this Artery riſes up below the Turky Chair, ſometimes higher, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times farther within the Skull; the ſame being preſently bent in from its firſt aſcent, goes in under the <hi>dura Mater</hi> till it comes to the anterior border of the ſame Chair; where again being intorted, and being ſent forth upwards with a certain compaſs, it perforates the hard Meninx, and is carried ſtraight towards the Brain. So this Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel with its double aſcent and crookedneſs (to wit, above the Baſis of the Skull, and then above the hard Meninx, together with its ſituation, ſtretcht out in length under the ſame) repreſents in moſt the letter ∽ inverſed; but in a man (as ſhall hereafter be more largely ſhewn) its ſite, by reaſon of the longer tract of the Veſſel and its greater curvature, repreſents the ſame letter double after this manner ∽ ∽.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="72" facs="tcp:152521:138"/>The Carotidick Artery in all Animals aſcends obliquely within the Skull; but as to its ſite or protenſion nigh the pituitary Glandula, it is not after the ſame manner in all: for in a man paſſing through the Canal-bone, peculiarly ingraven by it, with a ſingle Trunk, it lyes every where ſtretched out at length; and out of this Trunk it ſends forth ſometimes, though not always, ſome ſhoots to the pituitary Glandula. Alſo in a Horſe, its Trunk is ſingle; but where it firſt ariſes within the Skull, either Carotides, through the croſs branches ſent from one ſide to the other, before they perforate the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> communicate among themſelves. And as in moſt other living Creatures, the Artery, however before branched forth, yet being made one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Trunk, goes into the Brain; in a Horſe either Carotick Artery being parted in two, ſends forth upwards two branches, ariſing from the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> in two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct places.</p>
                           <p>In a Dog, Fox, Sheep, Calf, Stag, and many other four-footed beaſts, either of the Carotides, whilſt hid within the Skull under the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> being divided into ſmall ſhoots, and complicated with other Veſſels, to wit, both Veins and nervous Fibres, conſtitutes the Net-like infoldings; which infoldings, being ſtretched out on either ſide of the Turky Chair, fill the cavity there exiſting; then after manifold divarications of all the Veſſels, ſome arterious ſhoots being diſintangled from the others, and again united, grow together into one Trunk, which boring thorow the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> pailes ſtraight into the Brain.</p>
                           <p>The aforeſaid Infolding is, commonly called the wonderful Net, and that deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, for there is nothing in the whole fabrick of the animal Body more worthy of admiration; in which, beſides the arterious little branches which proceed from either of the aſcending Carotides, the veinous ſhoots, though fewer, meet with thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from the inward Jugular branches; and both kinds of Veſſels being divided into ſmall ſhoots, like a bundle of twiſted ſilk, are variouſly folded together: which complications of the Veſſels however are ſuſtained by the nervous Fibres, ſupplied from the greater Trunk of the fifth pair of Nerves. The aforeſaid infolding of the Veſſels or wonderful Net in ſome Animals is far greater, and contains much more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varications of the Veſſels than it hath in others; for in a Calf, Sheep, Goat, which are fed with graſs, its frame is larger than in a Dog, Cat, and other fleſh-eating and hotter Brutes. Further, it is obſervable, where the wonderful Net is greater, that the infolding of one ſide is ingrafted into the infolding of the other oppoſite ſide, and that from both, many more ſhoots of the Veſſels do enter into the pituitary Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; ſo indeed, that if you ſhall inject Ink into the Trunk of the Artery below the Skull, the Veſſels on either ſide, or the infoldings, will be dyed with the ſame tincture, and the black liquor will flow out of the Trunk of the oppoſite Artery.</p>

                           <p>By this kind of proviſion the Arteries about to enter the Brain are provided: yea, and the paſſages of the Veins, deſtinated for the returning of the blood from thence, ſeem alſo to be diſpoſed with a wonderful artifice. For when the anterior boſoms transfer their load into the two Laterals, which are the poſterior, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves end in the Jugular Veins, it is obſerved, that thoſe latter boſoms have furrows or cavities inſculped whereby they may ſettle or reſt upon the hinder part of the Head: and whenas either boſom, through a proper hole, being about to go into the Jugular Vein, ſlides out of the Skull; nigh that hole, in the outward part of the Skull, a round and ample den is made hollow, and covered over by the extremity on either ſide of the ſame boſom, inlarged into a greater capacity, to the end, that the blood, whilſt it ſlides forth out of the Head with a full torrent, ſhould not ruſh into the Veins with too rapid and vertiginous an influx, and ſo make a forcible entry on the Heart it ſelf, therefore it hath here a diverſion large enough, in which eſtuating or boiling up, till a more free and open ſpace may be granted to its courſe, it may be ſtaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trouble. Certainly there can be nothing more artificial thought upon, and that can better argue the Providence of the great Creator, than this fit or convenient diſpoſition of the blood in the brain, and without it, and the way of its reciprocation in divers Animals, accommodated to the neceſſity of every one. And laſtly, in the diſſection of Beaſts, other miracles of the ſame nature happen, whereby ſhewing the finger and Divine workmanſhip of the Deity, a moſt ſtrong and invincible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be oppoſed to the moſt perverſe Atheiſt.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The Brains of Fowls and Fiſhes deſcribed.</head>
                           <p>WHat hitherto we have ſhewn concerning the deſcription of the Brain and its Appendix, we chiefly owe to the obſervations made of the diſſection of the Heads of a Man and of four-footed Beaſts. We ſhall now proceed to the commenting upon theſe Obſervations; to wit, that we may endeavour, from the fabrick rightly conſidered of the parts of the Brain, ſo deſcribed, to erect their offices and uſes, and ſo to deſign the government of the animal Function: But becauſe a compared Anatomy may yield us a more full and exact Phyſiology of the Uſe of Parts; therefore before I enter upon this task, it will ſeem worth our labour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Heads of ſome other Animals, to wit, of Fowls and Fiſhes.</p>
                           <p>We have already hinted, that the Brains of Men and of four-footed Beaſts, were alike in moſt things; and alſo that the contents in the Heads of Fowls and Fiſhes being far different from both the former, yet as to the chief parts of the Head, are found to have between themſelves an agreement. The kinds of either Animals being coetaneous, and as it were Twins from the Creation of the World, do teſtifie their affinity in nothing more than in the fabrick of the Brain. That it is ſo in Man and four-footed Beaſts plainly appears already: we ſhall now ſee if that the Anatomy of Fowls and Fiſhes will ſhew us any thing worthy of note.</p>
                           <figure>
                              <head>Fig: VI<hi rend="sup">a</hi>
                              </head>
                              <figDesc>interior base of a calf skull</figDesc>
                           </figure>
                           <p>This ſuperior Membrane or hard Meninx being cut off, and ſeparated round about the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> appears very thin, which is not, as in man or other perfect Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, marked with ſuch frequent infoldings of the Veſſels; but this moſt ſubtil Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninx being made of a texture of Fibres, only clothes, and every where intimately binds about the even and plain ſuperficies of the brain contained within, and wholly deſtitute of turnings and windings about.</p>
                           <p>The fabrick of the brain in Fowls is otherwiſe than in man or four-footed beaſts: for beſides that in its compaſs the inequalities and the turnings and windings are wholly wanting; alſo more inwardly, the callous body and the <hi>Fornix,</hi> as alſo the chamfered bodies, which we deſcribed before, are all lacking: and beſides, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the brain it ſelf is figured after another manner. That theſe may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be beheld, make the diſſection of the brain of a Gooſe or a Turky-Cock; and the Membranes being cut off, by preſſing lightly the fiſſure or cleft of the brain, you may divide the middle of it one from another, and go forward to ſeparate it, till you come to its boſom, in which place are two marrowy bodies, which being ſtretched out like Nerves, connect the Hemiſpheres one to another. Either ſide of the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitium</hi> or the ſpace between, is clothed with a whitiſh Membrane, which is marked with ſtreaks or beams, lying or running from the whole compaſs or circumference, to the lower corner; and theſe ſtreaks concenter about the inſertions of the medul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary bodies. Then, if this Membrane be cut, in either Hemiſphere of the brain, there will appear underneath a cavity, which goes under the whole ſpace, from the ſide of the <hi>Interſtitium,</hi> and for a great part, the hinder region of the brain, and is arched or chambered with that ſtreaked Membrane. Either cavity or hollowneſs, about the bottom, is opened into an intermediate or common paſſage, which lies open to the Tunnel; and from either ſide of this paſſage the ſhanks of the oblong marrow are ſtretched out, to which, on either ſide, the Hemiſphere of the brain is hung by two medullary bodies; to wit, one marrowy or medullary body goes out from the mole or ſubſtance of the brain lying under the Ventricle, the other from the ſtreaked Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane covering the Ventricle. From theſe two, placed on either ſide, the medullary bodies being ſtretched out croſs-wiſe, like Nerves, joyn the two Hemiſpheres of the brain to one another. Beſides, theſe two growing together on either ſide, fix either Hemiſphere of the brain to the ſhanks of the oblong marrow.</p>
                           <p>So the figure of the Brain in Fowl, if you compare it with the brain in men and of the more perfect four-footed beaſts, ſeems to be as it were inverſed. For as in theſe the Cortical part is outward, and the medullary laid under it; ſo in Fowls, the lower frame of the brain, which conſiſts of a thick and cloſer ſubſtance, is inſtead of the <hi>Cortex</hi> or ſhell; but the outmoſt and upper Membrane, chambering the Ventricle, appears medullar or marrowy above any other part. Moreover, the Ventricles in the brains of a man and four-footed beaſts are placed beneath, and near the bottom; in Fowls, above and nigh the outward border. The reaſon of this difference ſeems to be, becauſe in a more perfect brain, ſuch as is in man and four-footed beaſts, the animal Spirits have both their birth and exerciſe; <hi>viz.</hi> they are procreated in its Cortical or ſhelly part, and in its medullary, which being large enough, lyes under this, they are circulated and variouſly expanded for the acting of their faculties. But truly in the brain of Fowls there is ſpace enough for the generation of Spirits, but for their circulation there is ſcarce any left: to wit, the brains of Birds ſeem not to be much poſſeſſed with the gifts of phantaſie or memory: yea it is thought, that the Spirits begotten in the brain are exerciſed chiefly in the oblong marrow for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the animal function; for there, as we ſhall ſhew anon, the medullary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which is inſtead of the callous body, conſiſts; and like the ſtreaked bodies in others, in theſe are ſtreaked Membranes, through which the Spirits, procreated in the brain, are carried, without any order there, forthwith into the oblong mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: but becauſe the Spirits, begot in the brain, ought to lay aſide a ſerous excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; therefore the Ventricles, from the complicature of the ſtreaked Membrane upon the keel or lower part of the brain, and on the ſhanks of the oblong marrow it ſelf, do ſerve conveniently enough for this buſineſs. Notwithſtanding, becauſe in the brains of Fowls, the <hi>Fornix</hi> is wholly wanting, there are only two anterior Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles; between which, the Choroeides infolding is ſtretched out; the veinous portion whereof, as was but now ſaid, ariſes a little lower from the fourth boſom; but the Arteries aſcending, come from either ſide of the oblong marrow.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="76" facs="tcp:152521:142"/>Nor is there a greater heterogeneity or difference of conformation in the Brain it ſelf of Fowls, than in the oblong marrow from the ſame in men and four-footed beaſts. For in the firſt Section, from whence the Optick Nerves ariſe, two noted protuberances grow to either ſide. Theſe are much greater in proportion than the orbicular prominences in the more perfect Creatures; ſo that they ſeem another additional brain: either of them of a white colour, and purely marrowy, is hollow within; ſo that in theſe kind of Animals are found two bellies or Ventricles in the brain, and as many in the oblong marrow. And ſeeing in theſe, as in all other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, a cavity is put under the Cerebel, the Ventricles in the whole Head differ as well in number as in figure and poſition.</p>
                           <p>In the middle of the medullary Trunk, to wit, where thoſe prominences grow to its ſides, the Chink, leading to the Tunnel, is cut, but into it the aperture of either Ventricle gapes or opens, that it is not to be doubted, but that the ſeroſities heaped up there, are ſent out by that way. Moreover it is likely, that theſe hollow and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullary prominences in Fowls ſupply the courſe of the callous body, to wit, in which the animal Spirits are circulated for the exerciſing their faculties: becauſe in the brain the ſpace is ſo narrow, that the Spirits cannot be produced and circulated together within its confines. Further, as in Fowls, the uſe of the animal Spirits is required for the act of the ſenſitive and loco-motive faculty, more than for phantaſie or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; certainly the chief place where they may meet and be exerciſed, ought to be placed rather in the oblong marrow than in the brain.</p>
                           <p>The Carotidick Arteries, which carry the blood to the brains of the greater Birds, are ſo ſmall, that there is no proportion of theſe to the ſame in man and four-footed beaſts. Their Trunks being carried within the Skull, aſcend without any branchings into net-like infoldings, after the ſame manner as in other Animals, nigh to the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitary Glandula, and paſs right into the brain, and diſtribute ſome ſmall ſhoots of the Veſſels both to its exterior compaſs, and through its inward receſſes. But in truth, the brains of Birds are watered with a very ſmall portion of blood, in reſpect of other living Creatures; becauſe, where the fancy or imagination is little exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, there is not much blood required for the refreſhing the animal Spirits.</p>
                           <p>Fowl (otherwiſe than ſome affirm) have both the mammillary proceſſes, and the Cribrous or Sieve-like bone. For the anterior productions of the brain being highly extenuated and involved with the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> ſtretching out almoſt to the middle part of the bill, are inſerted into the triangular bone, which hath a double boſom, diſtinguiſhed between with a thin mound or pale. But theſe proceſſes being dilated within the boſom of the aforeſaid bone, and in Bladders full of clear water, which are very like the mammillary proceſſes in a Calf, full of clear water. Beſides, as out of the fifth pair of Nerves, a noted branch on either ſide paſſing through the ball of the Eye, enters into the cavern of the Noſtril, a ſhoot of it being ſent out of the Trunk, is beſtowed to the very orifice of the Noſtrils; in the mean time, both the greater Trunks, compaſſing about the Cribrous bone, meet together, and preſently going one from the other, and being carried to the end of the bill, are diſtributed into the palate. After this manner Fowls, even as men and four-footed beaſts, are furniſhed with a peculiar organ of ſmelling, to wit, with a double mammillary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; and beſides, they have within the Noſtrils additional Nerves out of the fifth pair, by whoſe action and communication of branches into other parts, and among themſelves, ſo ſtrict an affinity is contracted between the ſmell and the taſte. The other pairs of Nerves are almoſt after the ſame manner as in men and four-footed beaſts. In like manner we alſo obſerve, that there is no great difference as to the Cerebel and the other portion of the oblong marrow, between Birds and the other Animals we have already conſidered on, unleſs that the orbicular prominences before the Cerebel, and the other annulary under it, meeting within them, are both wanting in Fowls; indeed theſe latter ſeem not at all to be required; but inſtead of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, they are eaſily ſupplied from the hollow medullary prominences, ſuch as we have ſhewn to be in Fowls.</p>
                           <p>And theſe are what are chiefly worth noting to be found in the brains of Fowls. We have already mentioned, that there is a certain likeneſs between theſe and Fiſhes as to the moſt parts of the head: wherefore it will ſeem to be to the purpoſe, that here for a concluſion we ſhould ſay ſomething of the brain of Fiſhes. Firſt, we ſhall obſerve, that as the heads of Fiſhes, in reſpect of the whole body, are greater than of any other living Creatures, yet they contain in them leſs brain than others. For
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:152521:142"/>
two little moles or ſubſtances, placed before, ſuſtain the whole place of the brain, properly ſo called; out of theſe, two ſignal ſmelling Nerves proceed, which are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by a long and ſtraight journey to the holes made hollow, out of either ſide of the mouth, and which are inſtead of noſtrils: and this is ſingular to Fiſhes. Moreover, we advertiſe concerning the Optick Nerves, that they, as in other living Creatures, inclining mutually one to the other, are not however united, unleſs perhaps towards the ſuperficies; but they are croſſed, and a Nerve ariſing from the right ſide of the oblong marrow, is carried into the left Eye, and ſo on the contrary: ſo indeed, that the viſory rays have their refraction, not only in the Eye, but within the very bodies of the Nerves. The oblong marrow in Fiſhes, wholly after the like manner as in Birds, hath two ſignal protuberances hollowed within; and in truth, as to local motions, the Spirits in either ſeem to the exerciſed after the like mode. For as Fiſhes ſwim in the water, ſo the flying of Fowls or Birds ſeems a certain kind of ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the Air. Further, in theſe 'tis obſervable, there are the pituitary Kernel, the Tunnel, and the Carotidick Arteries as in other Animals; alſo many pairs of the Nerves have the ſame origines and diſtributions, excepting that the hearing Nerves are here wanting; although <hi>Caſſerus Placentinus</hi> attributes this gift to the ſmelling Nerves. The figure of the Cerebel is the ſame as in more perfect Animals. Beſides, what we have remarked concerning the wandring pair of Nerves in man and four-foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beaſts; to wit, many fibres of it ariſing together, the trunk of the Nerve from the ſpinal marrow comes to them: in like manner the ſame is in Fiſhes. But to deſcribe them all further is needleſs: for the reſt, as thoſe which are proper to them only and Birds, as alſo thoſe which they have common with Fowls and the more perfect Animals, may be eaſily known, partly out of the peculiar ſimilitude with birds, and partly out of the univerſal Analogy of all. Therefore we will now philoſophiſe upon the Uſe and Action of the Brain and its Parts, and of its Appendix, together with the whole oeconomy of the animal Function: where in the firſt place, we will inquire into the offices of a more perfect Brain, ſuch as of man and four-footed beaſts; and alſo ſecondarily and collaterally we ſhall explain the Offices and Actions of a leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Brain, and of its Parts, ſuch as that of Fowls and Fiſhes.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the Offices of the Brain and its Parts: where first of all the Uſes of the Skull and the hard Meninx or <hi>Dura Mater</hi> is treated of.</head>
                           <p>THE Poets feigned <hi>Pallas</hi> to be formed within the Brain of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and from thence to be born. In truth, within the Womb of the Brain all the Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Ideas, Forces, and Powers whatſoever both of the Rational and Senſitive Soul are framed; and having there gotten a ſpecies and form, are produced into act. Wherefore it will be worth our labour to inquire into theſe places, of the generation of theſe more noble faculties, and the firſt riſe and primitive beginnings of them, as alſo more curiouſly to conſider the divers parts of the Brain, or the Organs ſerving to their Generation: And I go about this part of my labour the more willingly, that I may by handling the thread of our diſſection again, bring all the Phaenomena, before given to our inſpection and ſenſe, before the Eye of Reaſon, and to be again weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a more ſevere Examination of Diſcourſe; at leaſt thoſe things which ſeem to be of the greater moment, and chiefly worth taking notice of. Neither do we think here to heap up into a great Volume the ſeveral things worn out by the handling of others, and offered to common obſervation.</p>
                           <p>Therefore recollecting the Anatomy of the Brain, the firſt things to be conſidered are its coverings, to wit, the Skull, and the two Meninxes or Maters. Concerning the firſt it is obſerved, that all perfect Animals have an hard and bony Skull. A dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſon for which may be given: Firſt, that the Head being deſtinated for the moſt noble uſe, might be protected with a more firm and not eaſily penetrable covering, as a natural Helmet, againſt the injuries of external ſtrokes; beſides ſecondly, as this is in the place of Armor, ſo alſo of a Cloiſter; becauſe the ſame covering the <hi>dura Mater</hi> within, may reſtrain and keep within the Brain the Effluvia's of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:152521:143"/>
Spirits, leſt they ſhould too thickly evaporate, or in heaps. Further, as the Skull for theſe ends is made bony, the efficient cauſe are the ſaline Particles of the blood watering the brain, which being unprofitable to the interior work of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, and ſo to be ſent away outwardly, grow together thus in the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and are congealed into a ſtony hardneſs: For indeed the blood being carried towards the Head, as it abounds very much in Spirit, ſo in Salt; its Particles highly volatile, being joyned to the Spirits, are beſtowed on the brain; in the mean time, the ſaline little bodies, which are of a more fixed nature, being thruſt out into the circumference, from the Spirit implanted in the Brain, conſtitute the ſtony Skull, as it were a bubble covering incloſed wind.</p>
                           <p>Within the hollow ſuperficies of the Skull, there appear many furrows and inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities imprinted by the protuberances of the Veſſels; and we perceive frequently either border or plate of it to be perforated by the paſſing through of the Veſſels in ſeveral places: but the Arteries, ariſing in the exterior ſuperficies of the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> make theſe kind of little ditches through the concavity of the Skull. For when the whole ſubſtance of the brain is at firſt ſoft, and eaſily giving place, like Wax; the Arteries underneath it continually beating, as it hardens by degrees, eaſily imprint the marks of their tracts.</p>
                           <p>The figure of the Skull in four-footed beaſts is narrow and preſt down, but in man, the ſubſtance of whoſe brain is large, there is required a more capacious and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſpherical figure. For as God gave him an upright countenance to behold the Heavens, and alſo endued his brain with an immortal Soul, and fitted for the ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Heaven; therefore his face is erect or lifted up: ſo the brain it ſelf is placed in a more eminent place, to wit, above the Cerebel and all the Senſories. But in Brutes, and ſuch whoſe faces are prone towards the Earth, and have a brain unfit for ſpeculation, the Cerebel, however ſerving to the more noted action and office of the Praecordia, is placed in the higheſt ſeat to which the mole of the brain is ſubjected. Beſides, ſome organs of the Senſes, to wit, the Ears and Eyes, if they be not ſuperior, they are placed at leaſt equal to the brain. In an humane Head, the Baſis of the Brain and Cerebel being placed nigh together, yea of the whole Skull, is made parallel to the Horizon; whereby it comes to paſs, that there is leſs danger for any portion of the Head to be jogged here and there, or to be moved out of its proper ſeat: But in four-footed beaſts, who go with an hanging down head, the Baſis of the Skull makes a right angle with the Horizon; wherefore the brain being ſubjected, the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebel is put in the higheſt place; ſo indeed, that this ſeems leſs ſtable, and that it may ſhake, or be moved from its ſeat. However againſt this inconvenience, leſt a frequent concuſſion of the Cerebel might induce a ſinking down or loſs of the Spirits, or irregularities about the Praecordia, in ſome it is taken care of by a wonderful arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Nature; for as in all the frame or ſubſtance of the Cerebel is moſt ſtrictly bound faſt together by the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> beſides in ſome it is ſtaid by a bony fence; but in others, as in a Hare, Rabbet, and other leſſer Brutes, a certain portion of the Cerebel is included on either ſide by a ſtony bone, and ſo by this double hold its whole bulk or ſubſtance is firmly tyed to the Skull. Concerning the chief bones of the Skull, <hi>viz.</hi> the Cuniform or Wedge-like bone, the Cribrous or Sieve-like bone, and the auditory or hearing Organ, they ſhall be ſpoken of in their proper places, when we come to treat particularly of the Ventricles of the Brain, and of the Senſes to which theſe bones ſerve. We ſhall paſs next to the hard <hi>Meninx</hi> or <hi>dura Mater.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The <hi>dura Mater</hi> or hard Meninx, formed of a double kind of Veſſels and Proceſſes, bears alſo a double Aſpect, and owes part of its office to the Skull, that is about it, and part to the <hi>Encephalon</hi> contained within it. The exterior proceſſes of this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane are inſinuated within all the boſoms and cavities of the Skull; to ſome whereof they are a covering and defence, but to others they impart a ſenſible force; which manifeſtly appears in the Sieve-like bone, through whoſe holes the fringes of this Membrane paſſing, conduce ſomething to the ſenſe of ſmelling. Alſo the productions of this, lying over the receſſes and caverns of the Wedge-like bone, fortifie the ways for the entrance and coming out of the Veſſels. The interior proceſſes of the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> which belong to the Head, divide and diſtinguiſh between the parts of the brain and Cerebel; and in thoſe places the <hi>dura Mater</hi> is very thick, leſt in any great concuſſion of the Head, theſe two ſhould be ſmitten one againſt another, and ſhould preſs one upon the other. Wherefore in Dogs (as we have already hinted) who are wont to run violently with their heads down, there is ſent down between theſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:152521:143"/>
bodies a bony fence. In like manner in a Cat, Horſe, Fox, and many other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, from whoſe manner of living and uſe it is required, that they be moved with a ſwift motion, that bony fence, commonly called the Triangular Bone, is ſent down deeply between the Brain and the Cerebel; yea, and all the boſoms paſs through that bone in the holes curiouſly made hollow in it.</p>
                           <p>The Veſſels belonging to the <hi>dura Mater</hi> are either Arteries, that carry the blood thither; or they are Veins, which receiving from thence the ſuperfluous blood, and from the whole Head beſides, return it towards the Heart. As to the firſt ſort of Veſſels, on either ſide, two Arteries ariſing from the Carotidick Artery on the ſame ſide, before it comes to the Baſis of the Brain, are carried into the <hi>dura Mater:</hi> which notwithſtanding, only poſſeſſing the exterior ſuperficies or convex part, carry blood and juyce to this Membrane, alſo in ſome meaſure to the Skull and its cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. As to the Veſſels carrying the blood back, this Meninx contains four, into which, as into a great Sea, all the Rivulets of the Arteries, ſerving the whole Head, do exonerate themſelves: to wit, there are obſerved in this Membrane four noted Cavities, commonly called Boſoms; which are diſpoſed after that manner, that, like Promptuaries or Store-houſes framed in ſeveral places, they receive the blood return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from every region and corner of the brain: For the third boſom, or the longitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, looks towards the anterior brain, the fourth towards its middle; but the firſt and ſecond admit the blood flowing back from the Cerebel and hinder part of the brain. Further, out of theſe the third and fourth disburden themſelves into the firſt and ſecond; and theſe at length transfer their burden into the Jugular Veins. On every ſide, from theſe boſoms, the leſſer Veſſels, <hi>viz.</hi> the chanels of the Veins are ſent forth, which going out nigh the interior or concave ſuperficies of the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> are preſently inſerted into the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> and following its protenſion, being diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted through the whole compaſs, and all the interior receſſes of the brain and its Appendix within the Skull, and being complicated with the Arteries, receive the ſuperfluous blood, and carry it into thoſe greater cavities. That it is ſo, it plainly appears, becauſe if you ſquirt a liquor, dyed with Ink, into the Pipe of the Artery, that paſſing through the arterious ſhoots, and then the veinous, goes through at laſt into the boſoms.</p>
                           <p>Whilſt the blood, returning from the whole interior Head, is collected within thoſe boſoms, as with a full belly, it ſeems alſo in another reſpect to be of a very notable uſe; to wit, for the ſupplying of heat, requiſite for the diſtilling forth of the animal Spirits, as if it were a certain Chymical operation. For as much as the blood to be diſtilled, is contained in the Veſſels, interwoven into the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Rivers diffuſed on every ſide through the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> the heat being brought to it like a <hi>Balneum Mariae,</hi> flow about the underlying blood, and ſo force out of it a moſt ſubtil Liquor into the ſubſtance of the Brain; or rather, the blood raiſing up heat within the boſoms, is like the fire of ſuppreſſion, which in the diſtillation by deſcent, is inkindled round about the Veſſel containing the matter to be diſtilled. For indeed the interior ſubſtance of the Brain, for that it is endued with plenty of Salt and very little Sulphur, is of a more frigid temper: wherefore, that from the blood watering its ſuperficies, the ſpirituous part may be ſtilled forth, and forced into its middle or marrow, the degree of the ambient heat ought to be made the more ſtrong, ſuch indeed, as the blood collected in the ample Eſtuaries of the boſoms, may eaſily afford. Further, as thoſe boſoms being diſtended with heated blood, are like a certain diſtillatory Bath; ſo the other Membrane of the <hi>dura Mater</hi> being ſtretched out about the whole Head, is like an impervious Alembick, which with its covering keeps within the ſpirituous breaths, that they may not be immoderately evaporated.</p>
                           <p>Concerning this Membrane there may yet be conſidered, with what motion or ſenſe it is endued. And as to ſenſe, 'tis not to be doubted, but that it hath it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely: For ſince all the Membranes have feeling, and owe that faculty to the afflux of the animal Spirits from the Brain, ſurely this Meninx, for that it is nearer and very much of kin to the Brain and its Appendix, ſo that it clothes very many Nerves going out of the Skull, it obtains a very accurate virtue of feeling: which thing alſo may be argued from the effect; becauſe the pains of the Head often proceed from the breach of unity excited in this Membrane. But that it hath motion, it can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be thought, becauſe it is tyed in very many places to the Skull; and yet it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the ſame may ſometimes, in ſome parts at leaſt, be contracted and wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:152521:144"/>
or drawn together: And certainly there is no doubt, that it is contracted and remitted in ſneeſing. In like manner, when from an hurt of this a Vomiting or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive motions follow in the <hi>Viſcera</hi> or Members, this Membrane is the cauſe, which being ſomewhere contracted or divided, infolds with it ſelf the ſubſtance contained within with the ſame Convulſion or Spaſm.</p>
                           <p>Concerning the motion of this Membrane, a curious mind may yet further conſider its texture, and eſpecially how it is within the cavities of the boſoms, and the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitium</hi> or ſeparation of the Brain and Cerebel. For in theſe places are found many Fibres, or as it were greater or nervous cords or ſtrings, ſuch as we have obſerved to be variouſly ſtretched out in the Ventricles of the Heart. Within the boſoms, from the various proceſſes of the Membrane, a cavity full of turnings and windings, and manifoldly divided, as it were with many little Cells, is conſtituted. This ſeems to be thus made, to this end, to wit, that the blood returning back from divers little rivers into the cavities of the boſoms, may be retarded by ſeveral obſtacles, as it were little flood-gates; leſt perhaps ruſhing too impetuouſly and by heaps, it might flow within this Sea with a vertiginous and inordinate motion. But there is obſerved, beſides theſe intrications and little cells of this Meninx in the heads of four-footed beaſts, that moreover in the whole cavity of the boſoms, very many cords, as it were Ligaments, are every where produced from one ſide to the other. The office of theſe is partly, that they may contain the ſides of the cavity within their due ends of aperture and dilation, leſt they ſhould be diſtended above meaſure by the vehement ruſhing in of the blood, and ſo may preſs upon the ſubſtance of the brain. Yea the contexture of theſe whitiſh Fibres, which are met with, both within the cavities of the boſoms, and in this Meninx, going about the Cerebel, and diſtinguiſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the Brain, ſeems to intimate, that they ſerve alſo to ſome motion. For it may be ſuſpected, that thoſe ſtrong Fibres, and as it were Ligaments, do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times contract, ſometimes dilate, and variouſly draw the Membrane to which they are knit. From theſe kind of motions of the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> the blood flowing within the boſoms, may be variouſly agitated, and as occaſion ſerves, ſometimes haſtened in its Circle, and ſometimes reſtrained or hindred; for in many affections of the ſenſitive Soul, the blood being diſturbed from its equal circulation, is ſometimes precipitated by heaps and impetuouſly to the Heart, and ſometimes detained from its neſt longer, nigh the confines of the Brain. But that various whirlwinds of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſtir up ſuch irregularities in the motion of the blood, the nervous parts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted about the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> are in ſome meaſure the cauſe, which by contracting or dilating the ſame, variouſly moderate the courſe of the blood; yet ſo, that in the mean time, ſome part of this office is due from the brain it ſelf, or at leaſt to its Appendix. Indeed the brain it ſelf wants motion; but the blood paſſing through its ſubſtance, for as much as it is poured wholly in this Meninx, and paſſes through its receptacles, is at the motion and beck of this Membrane, ſometimes driven away from the brain, and commanded to ſuccour the Heart, as in fear and great ſadneſs, ſometimes being haſtened towards the brain, is for ſome time prohibited from flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, as in ſhame, indignation, and ſome other affections.</p>
                           <p>Truly, that theſe kind of interior proceſſes of the boſoms, and as it were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſtrings or cords, do conduce to the more commodious reduction of the blood, we gather alſo from hence, that in working beaſts, whoſe brain (becauſe they feed and go with a prone and hanging down head) is in greater danger of an inundation of the blood, thoſe proceſſes are very big, for that they being ſucceſſively contracted, may leiſurely thruſt out the blood, apt otherwiſe to ſtagnate by reaſon of the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the head. Neither is it from the purpoſe to obſerve here, that theſe ſame Animals are always furniſhed, for that reaſon, with a greater wonderful Net: by which means indeed it is provided, that the blood may not too much invade the brain by heaps; as care is taken by the artifice but now deſcribed, leſt the ſame ſhould make too long ſtay in the brain, and ſo oppreſs its more weak frame.</p>
                           <p>Therefore in the laſt place, that I may recollect what I have ſaid of the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> and rehearſe its chief uſes: Firſt, It covers over the Skull within, and reaches to it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of nouriſhment by the Veſſels. Secondly, It is a covering to the whole head, and ſerves to diſtinguiſh its chief parts. Thirdly, It contains the Veſſels deſigned for the reducing the blood from the whole interior head; which, in the mean time, by reaſon of the plenty of the blood contained in them, and the opportunity of their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, adminiſter requiſite heat for the diſtillation of the Spirits. Fourthly, It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:152521:144"/>
ways for the admiſſion and going out of all the Veſſels within the Skull, and fortifies them; to which may be added, that it beſtows on ſome of them their Coats, as ſhall be ſhewn anon. Fifthly and laſtly, This Meninx being here and there contracted or divided by the animal Spirits variouſly moved, according to the paſſions of the Soul, or the neceſſities of Nature, ſtays the blood ſometimes longer near the confines of the Brain, ſometimes drives it forward from thence towards the <hi>Praecordia.</hi>

                              <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the thinner Meninx or <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> of its ſtretching out, as alſo of the Infoldings of the Veſſels every where interwoven with it.</head>
                           <p>THE interior <hi>Meninx</hi> or <hi>Pia Mater</hi> is far thinner than the exterior, and conſiſts of a moſt ſubtle contexture of Fibres. This does not compaſs about the <hi>Encephalon</hi>'s ſuperficies as looſly as the <hi>Dura Mater;</hi> but embraces it ſo very ſtrictly, that it is very hardly ſeparated from it: beſides, it inſinuates it ſelf into all its turnings and windings and furrows, and clothes their inward parts. Further, this <hi>Meninx,</hi> although it be thin, yet being covered over throughout with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foldings of Arteries and Veins, is interwoven with them, and ſo waters all the ſpaces of the Brain and Cerebel with innumerable rivers. For as the Region of either of theſe, eſpecially of the Brain, is full of turnings and windings, this Membrane in like manner grows to the deep furrows of the crankling turnings about, and alſo to the tops of the ridges; yea, the chief complications of the Veſſels are ſtill placed in the vallies, as if they were there hid in regard of their ſafety. Neither doth this <hi>Meninx</hi> only cover the gapings of the turnings and windings about; but alſo ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers together the tops or heights of all their interſtices or places between, and knits them together, and ſo makes the whole ſuperficies of the Head plain, globous, and as it were like the World.</p>
                           <p>That the diffuſion of this wonderful Membrane into all the turnings and windings of the Brain, and the diſtribution of the Veſſels through thoſe moſt intimate receſſes, may be the better beheld; let the head of a man, or of a brute beaſt that dyed of the Dropſie, be opened: For in ſuch, whoſe brain abounds with much moiſture, the little ſtays, whereby this Meninx is fixed to the ſubſtance of the brain, are looſned, ſo that the Membrane, with the infoldings of the Veſſels, may be eaſily drawn away, and pulled off almoſt whole: which indeed being pulled off, the folds of the brain will appear naked; alſo the inſertions of the Veſſels every where into the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſubſtance of the brain, may be perceived. But to a ſound and dry brain the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> ſticks ſo cloſely, that it can ſcarce be drawn away in any part, or ſeparated with a Penknife.</p>
                           <p>We have already ſhewn after what manner the Veins and Arteries (which creeping like Ivy, are knit into the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> and variouſly interwoven into it) cover over with moſt thick little ſhoots, the whole compaſs of the Brain and Cerebel, and their Interſtices, the gapings of the crankling turnings and windings about, boſoms, and cavities, and ſend forth every where ſmall ſhoots into the medullary ſubſtance; ſo that it is not to be doubted, but that the animal Spirits, being as it were ſtilled forth immediately from the blood, every where in the whole head, are received into the Pores and paſſages of the Brain and Cerebel. From hence it will be eaſie to aſſign the uſe or office of the <hi>Pia Mater: viz.</hi> Firſt, this Membrane clothes the univerſal parts of the whole <hi>Encephalon,</hi> and diſtinguiſhes them all one from another. For indeed, this lying over all the gapings and interſtices of the turnings and windings, is inſtead of a mound or fence, by which the animal Spirits are reſtrained every where within their proper cells and orbs of expanſion, nor are they permitted by this means to run beyond their bounds, and ſo confound the acts of the many Faculties. Then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, this Meninx ſuſtains all the blood-carrying Veſſels, <hi>viz.</hi> both the Arteries and Veins, together with their manifold productions, and ſo affords a paſſage to the blood, by carrying it to and fro towards the brain.</p>
                           <p>Concerning theſe Veſſels, which are knit to this Meninx, and follow its ſtretching
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:152521:145"/>
out into all parts, there are many admirable things to be met with, and highly worthy of note, the uſes and reaſons of which is our purpoſe to ſearch into.</p>
                           <p>As to theſe, we ſhall firſt obſerve, that theſe Arteries and Veins, otherwiſe than in any other part of the body beſides, not ariſing nigh one another go forth as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, but going forth from oppoſite ends, meet every where mutually, <hi>viz.</hi> the Arteries aſcend from the Baſis of the Skull, and by creeping through the whole, emit upwards ſhoots and branches, which are met by the Pipes of the Veins ariſing out of the boſoms, and carried downwards. By this means the rivers of the blood ſeem to be made equal every where in the Brain, <hi>viz.</hi> whilſt the ſmaller ſhoots of the Veins follow or match the greater branches of the Arteries, and on the contrary, the ſmall branches of the Arteries the Trunks of the Veins.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, We have already ſhewn, that theſe Veſſels are variouſly and very much ingrafted or inoculated among themſelves, not only the Arteries with the Veins, but what is more rare and ſingular, Arteries with Arteries; to wit, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotidick Arteries of one ſide, in many places, are united with the Carotides of the other ſide; beſides the Vertebrals of either ſide among themſelves, and are alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated into the poſterior branches of the Carotides before united. The joynings together of the Carotides, in moſt living Creatures, are made about the Baſis of the Skull under the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and that after a diverſe manner; in ſome communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through the Veſſels of the wonderful Net from one ſide to the other; in others (as in a Horſe we have obſerved with a certain admiration) the arterious chanel is produced between the Trunks of the <hi>Carotides,</hi> whereby the blood may be carried from one ſide to the other, and ſo on the contrary. But beſides, between the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> about the Baſis of the Head, the ſame kind of ingraftings of the Arteries are ſtill ſeen in man and all perfect four-footed beaſts.</p>
                           <p>The reaſon of theſe ſeems to be partly, that the blood to be carried from the Heart into divers Regions of the Brain, might be exactly mingled as to its parts and particles, before it come to the place deſigned. For the Torrent of the blood, becauſe divided into leſſer rivulets, is incident to languiſh in ſo long a circuit, and its Spirits to be depauperated, and laſtly it ſelf to grow cool; unleſs that various courſes of its <hi>Latex</hi> ſhould anew inkindle this vital flame about to be extinguiſhed or dye.</p>
                           <p>But there is another reaſon far greater than this of theſe manifold ingraftings of the Veſſels, to wit, that there may be a manifold way, and that more certain, for the blood about to go into divers Regions of the Brain, laid open for each; ſo that if by chance one or two ſhould be ſtopt, there might eaſily be found another paſſage inſtead of them: as for example, if the <hi>Carotides</hi> of one ſide ſhould be obſtructed, then the Veſſels of the other ſide might provide for either Province. Alſo as to the <hi>Vertebral</hi> Arteries, there is the ſame manner of proviſion made. Further, if both the <hi>Carotides</hi> ſhould be ſtopped, the offices of each might be ſupplied through the <hi>Vertebrals,</hi> and ſo on the other ſide the <hi>Carotides</hi> may ſupply the defects of the ſhut up <hi>Vertebrals.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>After this manner, leſt there ſhould be wanting an afflux of the blood at any time in any part of the Brain, or its Appendix, within the Skull, there is care taken with ſingular Art: For as there are four diſtinct paſſages, and thoſe remote one from the other, of this <hi>Latex,</hi> if perchance three of them ſhould happen to be ſhut up, the blood being carried through one only, will ſoon ſupply or fill the chanels and paſſages of all the reſt. Which thing I have found by Experience often tryed, not without admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and great pleaſure. To wit, I have ſquirted oftentimes into either Artery of the Carotides, a liquor dyed with Ink, and preſently the branches on either ſide, yea and the chief ſhoots of the Vertebrals, have been dyed with the ſame tincture: yea, if ſuch an injection be ſometimes iterated by one only paſſage, the Veſſels creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into every corner and ſecret place of the Brain and Cerebel, will be imbued with the ſame colour. Alſo in thoſe who have the wonderful Net, the Tincture or dyed Liquor being injected in one ſide, it will come through the Net-like infoldings of the Veſſels in both ſides. Hence it plainly appears, that there is a communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Veſſels watering the whole Head; and although every Artery is carried to one only Region, as its peculiar Province, and provides for it apart; yet, leſt that any part ſhould be deprived of the influence of the blood, more ways lye open to every part by the ingraftings of thoſe veſſels; ſo that if the proper veſſels by chance ſhould be wanting in their office, its defect may preſently be compenſated by others neighbouring.</p>
                           <p>It is not long ſince we diſſected the dead body of a certain man, whom a great
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:152521:145"/>
                              <hi>Scirrhus</hi> or hard Swelling within the <hi>Meſentery,</hi> growing at laſt ulcerous, had killed. When his Skull was opened, we beheld thoſe things belonging to the Head, and found the right <hi>Carotides,</hi> riſing within the Skull, plainly bony or rather ſtony, its cavity being almoſt wholly ſhut up; ſo that the influx of the blood being denied to this paſſage, it ſeemed wonderful, wherefore this ſick perſon had not dyed before of an <hi>Apoplexy:</hi> which indeed he was ſo far from, that he enjoyed to the laſt moment of his life, the free exerciſe of his mind and animal function. For indeed, Nature had ſubſtituted a ſufficient Remedy againſt that danger of an <hi>Apoplexy;</hi> to wit, the <hi>Vertebral</hi> Artery of the ſame ſide, in which the Carotidick was wanting, the bulk of the Pipe being enlarged, became thrice as big as both its Pipes on the other ſide: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, the blood being excluded the Carotidick, adding it ſelf to the wonted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Vertebral Artery, and flowing with a double flood into the ſame belly, had ſo dilated the chanel of that Artery above meaſure. This Gentleman, about the beginning of his ſickneſs, was tormented with a cruel pain of the Head towards the left ſide. The cauſe whereof cannot be more probably aſſigned, than that the blood excluded from the right Carotidick Artery, when at firſt it ruſhed more impetuouſly in the left, had diſtended the Membrane; and therefore the ſame diſtemper did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vaniſh of its own accord, to wit, the ſuperfluous blood being derived through the Vertebral Artery.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, Concerning theſe ſanguiferous Veſſels covering the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Arteries and Veins, whilſt they meet one another, going out from oppoſite ends, do not only transfer their burden immediately through the ſeveral branches or ſhoots, mutually ingrafted, as is wont to be done in other parts of the Body; but being variouſly complicated and interwoven, do conſtitute every where admirable infoldings, into which, for the moſt part, very ſmall and very numerous Glandula's or Kernels are inſerted. Which thing is ſeen, not only in the infoldings, which are called <hi>Choroeides,</hi> (by which name, beſides thoſe which are found within the plicature or folding up of the Brain, we alſo intend others planted together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Cerebel) but theſe kind of infoldings of the Veſſels, with Glandula's ſowed between, are ſeen every where to be ſprinkled through the whole compaſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior receſſes of the Brain and Cerebel, and eſpecially between the gapings of their turnings and windings and interſtices. This is clearly manifeſt in a moiſter Brain, or in an Hydropical, where the very ſmall Glandula's, which otherwiſe are ſcarce to be ſeen, being intumified by the moiſture, are eaſily beheld. Moreover, from the aforeſaid infoldings, on every ſide implanted, little ſlender Veſſels, being every where ſent forth, enter the Cortical, and in ſome meaſure the medullary ſubſtance of the Brain and its Appendix; for if you ſquirt into the <hi>Carotides</hi> a black liquor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſhoots of the Veſſels, which it dyes every where with the ſame colour, little blackiſh pricks will appear ſprinkled in the ſubſtance of the Brain. Further, if the brain of a living Animal be cut up, the live blood will ſpring forth both from its <hi>Cortex</hi> and medullary part. The reaſon and end of all which, if they be inquired into, it ſeems that theſe foldings of the Veſſels, being variouſly complicated with repeated windings about, as if they were little ſerpentine chanels hanging to an Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick, through whoſe narrow ſtraits the blood paſſing with a long circuit, becomes ſtill more ſubtil and elaborated; to wit, its thicker part, being by degrees put off in its paſſage, or ſent away by the little branches of the Veins, and ſo at length the only pure and moſt ſpirituous blood, and it ſelf now ready to go into animal Spirits, is admitted within the Pores and paſſages of the brain. But as the blood or ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolent part is ſupped up by the Veins, ſo it's very likely the Serum or watry part is received by the Glandula's or Kernels interwoven in them. For it appears not for what other end theſe Arteries are every where beſet with ſo many Kernels, unleſs they ſhould lay up in them the ſuperfluous ſeroſities. Between theſe infoldings there appear not any Nerves to be found, which may require any juyce or ſerous humor from theſe Kernels; and 'tis not yet found, whether theſe Lymphaeducts or Water-carriers be accompanied with any Veſſel: wherefore it may be lawful to ſuppoſe, that whilſt the purer and ſpirituous part of the blood, being ſeparated from the reſt of its maſs, is ſtilled forth into the brain, the ſerous humidities are received by the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula's, which are numerous, and that they are for ſome time retained by them, till they may be ſent away into the Veins growing empty again.</p>
                           <p>Thus far we have beheld only the ſuperior branchings forth of the blood-carrying Veſſels, which are every where interwoven in the <hi>Pia Mater;</hi> and their infoldings,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:152521:146"/>
which like the leaves of a Wood, or creeping Ivy, cover the exterior compaſs of the whole Head. But by what means, and as it were Chymical Artifice, theſe Veſſels do inſtil the animal Spirits into the Brain and Cerebel, and ſerve for the uſe of one another beſides, ſhall be told anon, after we have conſidered of the inferior Aſpect and next the ground of this moſt thick Wood, <hi>viz.</hi> the greater Trunks of all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, which are deſtinated for the Brain, where they paſs through the Skull, and ſhew themſelves beyond it.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Shews with what difference the Arteries in various Animals paſs through the Skull; alſo for what uſe the wonderful Net is made, and the reaſon of it.</head>
                           <p>THE Arteries, deſtinated to the Brain, are four in number, <hi>viz.</hi> two <hi>Carotides,</hi> and as many <hi>Vertebrals.</hi> Concerning the former, we have already obſerved, that their Trunks paſs through the Wedge-like Bone, as it were with a mechanical proviſion; to wit, either Artery is ſo bowed and intorted in its aſcent, that the blood, before it can reach to the Brain by a repeated ſtopping of ſhores, or hindred by a certain lett or impediment, might flow to it leſs rapidly and more ſlowly. But this is not effected after one and the ſame manner in all Animals: for although the aſcent of the Artery be oblique and intorted in all, yet in ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> in a Man and a Horſe, it being bowed about with a greater compaſs, ſtill enters, even to the Brain, with a ſingle and undivided Trunk: when in moſt other beaſts the ſame paſſes the Skull with a leſſer circuit, and ſliding preſently under the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> diverſifies it ſelf there into Retiform infoldings, commonly called the wonderful Net. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſeems to be to the purpoſe, that we inquire into the various reaſons of this difference.</p>
                           <p>In the firſt place therefore we ſhall advertiſe you, that the Carotidick Artery in a man enters a little more backward the Skull, than in any other Animal, <hi>viz.</hi> nigh that hole through which the lateral boſom ſlides out of the Skull about to be implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Jugular Vein; for in the reſt, this Artery ariſes within the Skull under the end or acute proceſs of the ſtony Bone. But in an humane Head, the ſame being carried about by a longer compaſs, (that the Torrent of the blood, before it comes to the border of the Brain, might flow ſlowly and pleaſantly with a broken force) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the Baſis of the Skull nigh the den made by the ingreſs of the lateral boſom; where being preſently intorted, it enters the proper Chanel inſculped in the Wedg-like Bone, and for the greater aſſurance it is clothed beſides with a thicker additional Coat. This double defence ſeems to be given it, leſt the blood, boiling up too much, and whilſt it is carried violently towards the head, ſhould make a Whirlpool about the ingreſs of the Skull, to wit, where it begins to be wreathed about from its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect aſcent, and ſhould break by its ſtood the banks of the Belly, unleſs they were more firm. The Artery being ſlid out of the bony chanel, lays aſide alſo its aſcititious or additional Coat; and now being well enough defended within the Skull, goes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward clothed only with its proper Coat, and creeps under the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and being as it were depreſſed in the midſt of its paſſage into a valley, being immediately carried out again, it goes on till it comes to the head of the Turky Chair; where again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bent in and intorted, with a certain compaſs, it aſcends ſtraight, and boring through the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> is carried towards the Brain. The Trunk of this <hi>Carotis,</hi> like a Meander, paſſing through the Skull with a very much bending way or paſſage, is aptly repreſented in the firſt Figure of the following Table.</p>
                           <p>If the reaſon of this kind of Conformation be inquired into, it eaſily occurs, that in an humane Head, where the generous Affections, and the great forces and ardors of the Souls are ſtirred up, the approach of the blood to the confines of the Brain, ought to be free and expeditious; and it is behoveful for its River not to run in narrow and manifoldly divided Rivulets, which would ſcarce drive a Mill, but always with a broad and open chanel, ſuch as might bear a Ship under Sail. And indeed, in this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:152521:146"/>
reſpect, a man differs from moſt brute beaſts, in which, the Artery being divided into a thouſand little ſhoots, leſt it ſhould carry the blood with a fuller chanel, or more quick courſe than is requiſite, makes the Net-like infoldings, by which indeed it comes to paſs, that the blood ſlides into the Brain very ſlowly, and with a gentle and almoſt even ſtream. If that be true, as ſome affirm, that the wonderful Net alſo is ſometimes found in an humane Brain, I believe it is only in thoſe ſort of men, who being of a ſlender wit or unmoved diſpoſition, and deſtitute of all force and ardor of the mind, are little better than dull working beaſts in fortitude and wiſdom.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, The conformation of the Carotidick Artery in a Horſe, comes neareſt its ſtructure in a man; for in this the Artery enters the Skull alſo lower, and with a greater compaſs than in other four-footed beaſts: which being paſſed, its Trunk being intorted, with a certain compaſs, and then a little depreſſed, goes forward whole to the ſide of the Turky Chair ſtill with a full and broad chanel: which truly ought to be made ſo, becauſe magnanimous and fierce forces are convenient for this Animal, born as it were for War and any dangerous attempts; and ſo there was need, that the blood might aſcend the Brain with a free and plentiful courſe, and (when occaſion requires) with a full Torrent. But though the blood paſſes through the Baſis of a Horſes Skull in the ſame undivided chanel, yet it ought not to come to the Brain it ſelf in one ſingle paſſage; becauſe the frame or ſubſtance of this in a Horſe being far weaker and colder than in a man, it might be overthrown and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the blood ruſhing in by heaps: wherefore the great River of the Artery disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens it ſelf by two Emiſſaries, and pours out its <hi>Latex</hi> at ſo many diſtinct places of the Brain. Further, as if by this means there were not yet ſufficient caution againſt the Deluge of the Brain, a tranſverſe or croſs chanel, as it were a diverſion, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med between the chanels of either Artery; through which the blood, being ſtraitned for room, may go aſide, and flow and reflow from one bank or chanel to another, rather than oppreſs or overflow the Brain. Alſo beſides, certain ſhoots being ſent out from the Trunk of either Artery, are inſerted into the pituitary Glandula, the uſe of which is doubtleſs to ſeparate certain ſeroſities of the too watry blood, and to lay them up into that Glandula, whereby the reſt of the bloody <hi>Latex,</hi> to be carried to the Brain, becomes more pure and free from dregs. By what means the Caroti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dick Arteries, in the head of a Horſe, paſs through the Baſis of the Skull, is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the ſecond Figure of the following Table. I have not yet had the means to inſpect the brains of a Lyon or a Monkey; but there is reaſon to ſuſpect, that in theſe alſo the Carotides do paſs through the Skull with a ſingle Trunk. In a Sheep, Calf, Hog, yea in a Dog, Fox, Cat, and other four-footed beaſts, which I have hitherto opened, this Artery is divaricated into Net-like infoldings, which Veſſels, for what cauſes and for what uſes they are ſo made, we ſhall now inquire into.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly therefore, moſt other four-footed beaſts, different from a Man and a Horſe, have the wonderful Net adjoyned to the Carotidick Artery. In truth, this is met with in ſo many, that common Anatomy hath aſcribed it to all Animals, and alſo to man it ſelf. In whom it is found, we obſerve, that the Artery, about to enter the Skull, is not carried about with ſo long a compaſs, but riſing up nigh the hinder part of the Turkiſh Chair, is preſently divided into ſmall ſhoots; yet ſo, as one little chanel is ſtretched right out, which the blood quietly running to, paſſes through without any ſtay, being carried ſtraight into the Brain: but from the ſide of this many rivulets are derived on every ſide, into which the blood impetuouſly aſcending, may be eaſily diverted. Theſe little rivers are partly ingrafted into the veinous paſſages of the ſame, and the Veſſels of the other ſide, and are partly carried into the pituitary Glandula, and partly a compaſs being fetched, are returned into the former chanel or belly of the Artery. That it is ſo, beſides naked inſpection, appears plainly by this Experiment. If below the Skull, an inky liquor be gently and by degrees injected into the Trunk of the <hi>Carotis,</hi> that paſſing through the ſtrait paſſage, is carried preſently into the Brain, nor does it dye the lateral infolded Veſſels with its tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; but if this liquor be immitted continually and forcibly, preſently running into the folds, it will make black the Veſſels of the ſame and of the oppoſite ſide, alſo entring the hither part of the Glandula and its interior ſubſtance. If the uſe of theſe kind of infoldings of the Veſſels, or the wonderful Net be inquired into, I ſay, that it is made chiefly for theſe ends: <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, that the Torrent of the blood being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſmall rivulets, its more rapid courſe may be ſo far dull'd or broken, that it may be but leiſurely inſtilled into the Brain. For otherwiſe in labouring beaſts,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:152521:147"/>
who go with their heads hanging down, and have but a weak brain, the more free influx of the blood might eaſily overthrow the fabrick of the Brain, and ſpoil the animal Spirits. Secondly, the divarication of the <hi>Carotides</hi> into Net like infoldings, hath another uſe of no leſs moment, to wit, that the more watry blood being (as it is its temperament in moſt Beaſts, and eſpecially in thoſe who are fed with herbage) before it be poured upon the Brain, might carry away ſome part of the ſuperfluous Serum to the pituitary Glandula, and inſtil the other part into the branches or ſhoots of the Veins to be returned towards the Heart. Thirdly and laſtly, for as much as the Veſſels on either ſide are mutually inoculated by this means, there is care taken both that the blood may be exactly mixed before it aſcends to the Brain, as alſo that more certain ways may be made for its paſſage: becauſe, if perchance an obſtruction ſhould happen in one ſide of the wonderful Net, the blood by that infolding being preſently carried to the other, may find a paſſage: for this cauſe, to wit, that the blood might be the better prevented from any impediment in its paſſage, the Veſſels are not only inoculated under the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> about the wonderful Net, but the Arteries again on either ſide, do the ſame thing as ſoon as they, being knit to the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> reach the ſuperficies of the Brain, as hath been already ſhewn. By theſe ſort of ingraftings of the Veſſels in the wonderful Net, it comes to paſs, that an inky liquor being injected into one of the <hi>Carotides,</hi> and forced upwards, deſcends by the Trunk of the Artery on the oppoſite ſide, as we have elſewhere obſerved. Some rude draught of the wonderful Net is expreſſed in the third Figure of the following Table.</p>

Hence we obſerve, becauſe the conformation of the Cerebel is alike in all Creatures, therefore alſo the Vertebral Arteries, different from the <hi>Carotides,</hi> are found alike in all without any great difference. Nor does there ſeem to be need of any great proviſion for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or entrance of the Vertebral Arteries within the Skull; becauſe, as they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a leſſer portion of the blood, and for that the blood it ſelf that is to be beſtowed on the Cerebel, is wont there to be agitated or moved with no perturbations of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or conceptions; therefore there is not that neceſſity that there ſhould be placed any remora or any incitement for its Torrent.</p>
                              <p>The Vertebral Artery, ariſing from the branch in the fifth Rib, in its whole aſcent through the hinder part of the Head, paſſes through the little holes cut in the extube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> till it comes near the Baſis of the hinder part of the Head; where the ſame being bent down on either ſide, and admitted into the Skull by the laſt hole, excepting where the ſpinal Marrow goes forth, is carried by the ſide of the oblong marrow; but as ſoon as it is brought to the region of the Cerebel, it ſends forth branches on either ſide, which cover its ſuperficies, and beſides on its back ſide make infoldings no leſs ſignal than thoſe commonly called the <hi>Choroeides,</hi> and with larger Kernels more thickly interwoven. As <hi>thoſe</hi> ſhoots convey the Juyce requiſite for the ſtilling forth the animal Spirits, ſo <hi>theſe</hi> convey the heated blood and the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from the ſerous Colluvies. Further, beneath the Cerebel, both the Vertebral branches, inclining mutually one to another, are united, as it were for that end, that if the flowing of the blood ſhould be ſtopped on either ſide, it might be ſupplied from the other to the whole compaſs of the Cerebel and its neighbouring parts. Theſe ſanguiferous Veſſels covering the Cerebel, even as the others do the Brain, make ſignal infoldings both in its outward ſuperficies, and in that of the oblong marrow, and alſo within its lappets and folds; from which ſmall ſhoots are ſent forth every where into its under-lying ſubſtance: ſo that from theſe a ſubtil liquor, as it were ſtilled forth and imbibed by the Cortical ſubſtance of the Cerebel, ſeems to go into animal Spirits. By what means, and in what parts of the Head the production of the animal Spirits is performed, remains next to be inquired into.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, it appears from what hath been already ſaid, that the blood is it ſelf the matter out of which the animal Spirits are drawn; and that the Veſſels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and carrying it every where through the whole compaſs of the Head, are like diſtillatory Organs, which by circulating more exactly, and as it were ſubliming the blood, ſeparate its purer and more active particles from the reſt, and ſubtilize them, and at length inſinuate thoſe ſpiritualized into the Brain and its Appendix. Concerning this matter to be diſtilled, there is care taken, and indeed by the beſt means, that its ſtock or proviſion may be ſtill ſupplied in fit quality and due quantity.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="88" facs="tcp:152521:149"/>In reſpect of the quality, from the whole bloody maſs, a portion highly volatile, ſpirituous, and endued with active Elements, ought conſtantly to ariſe towards the Head; which thing ſucceeds partly of its own accord, and partly that it might be more commodiouſly done, care is taken with a certain artificialneſs; to wit, the Vertebral Arteries, in all Creatures aſcending ſtraight, and almoſt perpendicularly, do in a manner cauſe, that only the more ſubtil and light blood is carried upwards, the remaining more thick as it were ſinking down for the baſer offices of the Limbs and of ſome of the Bowels. Yea, alſo the <hi>Carotides</hi> in a man, having an erected head higher than the reſt of the parts, and in a Horſe in ſome ſort lifting up his face, have alſo the ſame priviledge; to wit, that by their more ſteep aſcent only the more pure and volatile blood may aſcend to the region of the Brain. But in other four-footed beaſts, who go with a prone or hanging head, and who have a more frigid and watry blood, which may eaſily ſlide into, and too much waſh the Brain, this evil is in ſome part prevented by the wonderful Net and pituitary Glandula joyned to the <hi>Carotides;</hi> which indeed receive the ſuperfluous humidities of the blood, and ſo make it more pure and free from dregs before it comes to the brain.</p>
                           <p>But that the blood may be ſupplied ſtill in due quantity, to wit, as it were in weight and meaſure, from the diſtillatory Veſſels, ſtretched about the compaſs of the Head, there is a notable proviſion made in all the <hi>Carotides</hi> about the Baſis of the Skull: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their crooked imbowings and branching into infoldings, hinders the too great or too rapid approach of the blood: then, leſt the paſſage of it ſhould at any time be ſhut up, the mutual ingraftings of all the Veſſels on either ſide, do help or provide for. After this manner, the buſineſs of extracting the animal Spirits is performed even as a Chymical Elixir; to wit, great care is taken in the beginning of that Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, both that choice of matter may be had, and that only a due proportion of it be expoſed to diſtillation.</p>
                           <p>The blood by this means, as it were a Chymical work prepared, is carried by the fourfold Chariot of the Arteries to four diſtinct regions of the Head: and as the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiferous Veſſels, being diſtributed with ſeparate ramifications or branches through the whole compaſs of the Brain and its Appendix, cover all the heights of its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſings about or gyrations, and alſo all its crevices and their gapings and receſſes, they bring to their doors the matter to be diſtilled into the Head every where through the whole circumference of the Brain and Cerebel nigh the Cortical ſubſtance of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; out of which as the Spirits are diſtilled, by this means it is brought about, that they are inſinuated into the ſubjected ſubſtance of either. The blood being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through the narrow infoldings and divarications of the Veſſels, as it were (as was ſaid) through the ſerpentine chanels of an Alembick is made extremely ſubtle, as much as may be, in its liquor; in the mean time, what is bloody is received by the little ſhoots of the Veins aſſociates, or meeting one another every where, and what is ſerous by the Kernels every where diſperſed; yet its more purified and ſpirituous part being carried on further through the very ſmall ſhoots ſent forth on all ſides, are inſtilled more deeply into the very Pores and paſſages of the Brain and Cerebel; which preſently flowing from the Cortical ſubſtance into the medullary, there exerciſe the gifts of the animal Function. What peculiar body and conſtitutive particles of the Brain it ſelf and Cerebel, conduce to the generation and perfection of the animal Spirits within the ſubſtance of either, ſhall be ſhewn hereafter, when we treat of the Uſe of thoſe Parts: now ſhall be taken notice of what we before mentioned, to wit, that the fluid extillation of the ſpirituous liquor from the blood about the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> is performed after a ſignal manner, both from the ambient heat, which is ſtirred up from the blood contained within the boſoms, as it were from a <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> inriched by the continual flowing of it anew, and alſo from the obduction of the Meninges, like an Alembick, by which the ſpirituous Particles, apt to fly away, are conſtrained and forced into the parts beneath.</p>
                           <p>But indeed, though the animal Spirits are procreated wholly from the blood, yet the blood watering the Brain and its Appendix, is not only beſtowed on this work: for as to the ſanguiferous Veſſels, which ariſing out of the Trunks both of the Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides and the Vertebrals, cover over the whole Head and all its parts and proceſſes; though many of them, yet not all, are little diſtillatory chanels of the animal Spirits. For the animal Spirits are not produced in all places, to which theſe Veſſels reach; for we affirm, that theſe Spirits are only procreated in the Brain and Cerebel: (which it were eaſie to prove by the Symptoms which happen in the Apoplexy and Palſie, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:152521:149"/>
ſhall be afterwards clearly ſhewn) and from this double fountain of the animal Spirits they flow out into all the reſt of the parts, and irradiate, by a conſtant influence, the whole nervous ſtock. In the mean time, the oblong marrow and its various proceſſes and protuberances are either retreating places, or high roads for the animal Spirits, procreated in the Brain and Cerebel, and flowing from thence. But for as much as the Arteries and Veins clothe theſe parts alſo with a thick ſeries of ſhoots, and that within the infolding of the Brain the folds called <hi>Choroeides</hi> are hung ſlack and looſly, theſe ſeem to be ſo made for other reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi> both that theſe parts might be actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by heat, ſupplied as it were from a continual fire, and alſo that the nouriſhing Juyce might be beſtowed on the Spirits which flow there.</p>
                           <p>As to the firſt, that the animal Spirits now perfected, may be freely expanded, and irradiate the nervous <hi>Syſtem,</hi> there ſeems to be required, that the ambient heat, being excited by the blood flowing thither, might open all the little ſpaces for their paſſage, and notably dilate or lay open for them ways or roads: wherefore we inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated before, becauſe the little ſhoots of the Veſſels ought not to be deeply inſerted into the callous body, (for that, leſt the commerce of the Spirits, diverting in this Mart or meeting place, ſhould be diſturbed by the perpetual influence of the blood) therefore the infolding of the <hi>Choroeides</hi> is hung under its chamber, that at leaſt by this nigh ſituation, as by a Stove or Hot-houſe, the heat there might be preſerved. Beſides, we intimated another uſe of this infolding; to wit, that the blood, paſſing through the very narrow <hi>Meanders</hi> and convolutions or rollings about of the Veſſels, might lay aſide its ſerous recrements into the Glandula's or paſſages of the Veins.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, That many branches and leſſer ſhoots of the ſame Veſſels, which water the Brain and Cerebel, cover alſo the oblong marrow, and in ſome meaſure enter into its Pores and deeper ſubſtance (within which the animal Spirits are not begotten, but only exerciſed and expanded) I ſay, that this is ſo made for this other reſpect; to wit, that the ſubſtance of the oblong marrow might imbibe a conſtant proviſion of nouriſhment from the pouring in of the blood whereof it hath need. For whilſt the animal Spirits, flowing into the nervous ſtock from the Brain and Cerebel, paſs through this paſſage, as it were the high road, ſome food he e ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to them, as it were in their journey, from the watering blood: For indeed we ſuppoſe (which alſo will afterwards clearly appear) that the oblong marrow, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the nervous parts, is moiſtned with a double humor, <hi>viz.</hi> one ſpirituous and highly active, which flows altogether from the Brain and Cerebel, and being from thence derived into the whole nervous ſtock, beſtows upon them the ſenſitive and moving Faculties; and the other humor ſofter and more oily and ſulphureous, which being ſupplied from the blood, and affuſed immediately on every part, is the Author of their Heat and Vegetation. Both theſe Juyces agree among themſelves, and being every where joyned together and married, they are as it were a maſculine and feminine ſeed mixed together; and ſo they impart to all parts both ſenſe and motion, and all the powers of life and growth. Wherefore it is obſerved, that all the parts of the whole body, by which motion and ſenſe are performed, do not only ſwell up with the animal Spirit, of whoſe influence being deprived, they preſently ſuffer a reſolution or looſning; but alſo they admit the ſanguiferous Veſſels; of whoſe Tribute if they be defrauded, preſently they wither away, or are diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a mortification or Gangrene. Wherefore, that the fleſh, membranes, and all the bones may be watered with the blood, (as may be perceived by the help of a Microſcope) the very little or minute bodies of ſome of the Nerves are ſurrounded with Capillaments or little hairs of Arteries and Veins, together with their proper Fibrils, that we need not doubt to aſſert, that the Veſſels penetrating the ſuperficies of the <hi>Brain</hi> and <hi>Cerebel,</hi> do diſtil into them a ſubtil matter for the generation of the animal Spirits; but that ſome other ſhoots of the ſame Veſſels, covering the oblong marrow, do only impart to it heat and nouriſhing Juyce. Laſtly, that the infoldings of the <hi>Choroeides</hi> were built under the chamber of the oblong marrow, chiefly for the diſpenſing of heat, and in ſome meaſure for the ſake of ſeparation of the ſerous <hi>Latex.</hi> But concerning theſe, we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more largely afterwards, when we ſhall treat of the nutritious and nervous Juyce, and when we ſhall conſider of that famous Controverſie, <hi>viz.</hi> whether nouriſhment is made by the blood or Nerves: further, we ſhall elſewhere ſpeak more fully of the Nature, Hypoſtaſis, and diverſe Diſpoſition of the animal Spirits; alſo, what the ſubſtance of the Brain, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the parts, may contribute to their production.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="90" facs="tcp:152521:150"/>Thus far concerning the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> and the blood-carrying Veſſels, which are wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in it, and following its protenſion, water the whole Head, we have treated largely. But before we quite leave the conſideration of this Membrane, we will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what ſenſe and motion it may have. Certainly it is not undeſervedly that we aſcribe the moſt cruel Head-aches to the more acute ſenſe of this; (in which however, by what means this Meninx is affected, does not ſo eaſily appear.) It is the common opinion, that ſharp and tormenting Vapours, being raiſed from the Viſcera of the lower Belly, eſpecially from the Ventricle, Hypochondria, or Womb ſtrike againſt this Membrane, and ſo pierce it with pain. But we ſay, though this be impoſſible, that Vapours paſſing ſo many interſtices and bars of the Viſcera and bones, without any trouble, ſhould ever come to the Head and hurt it: yet we do not deny, but that ſometimes vaporous Effluvia's do proceed from the blood boiling or eſtuating within the confines of the Brain, which being ſhut up together under the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> and as it were gathered into a Cloud, do greatly blow up and diſtend it, and ſo diſtemper it with pain. I have often ſeen, in a Head newly opened after death, the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> diſtended, and ſhining like a Bladder, that the ſame ſeemed to be intumified, with much water included under it; which notwithſtanding was found to be ſo done by wind diſtending the Membrane, for that being diſſected, that Tumor fell down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the effuſion of water.</p>
                           <p>But we think the Head-aches, which happen by reaſon of the evil of this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, are chiefly excited by another means, to wit, for as much as this Meninx ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers a breach of the unity by the blood boiling up above meaſure, and ruſhing into its Pores, and ſo it is contracted into lighter Convulſions. I have ſometimes opened the Heads of the defunct, which when living, were obnoxious to moſt miſerable Head-aches; in which, near the longitudinal boſom, where the ſeat of the pains was, the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> or interior, grew to the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> or exterior for ſome ſpace, oft-times for two fingers breadth, and by their growing together had excited a ſharp and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Tumor; in which the mouths of the Veſſels were ſo wholly ſtopped up, that there was left for the blood, though very much boiling up, no paſſage into the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning boſom.</p>
                           <p>As to the motion of this Membrane, we wholly deny, that it hath in it ſelf a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Syſtole and Diaſtole; however, the Pulſes in ſome Arteries, have ſeemed ſomething like it, which have given occaſion perchance to this vulgar Opinion. Yet in the mean time, it may be lawful to believe, that this Meninx, for that it is very ſenſible, is rendred obnoxious to Cramps and convulſive motions: and that from its greater contraction the fits of the Falling-ſickneſs do ariſe, and from its leſſer and more partial corrugation or wrinkling together, Head-aches, as hath been ſaid, and alſo ſometimes Scotomies, Vertigoes, and often Convulſions of the Members and Viſcera, planted at a great diſtance from the origine of the Nerves, being drawn into conſent.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> A Deſcription of the Brain, properly ſo called, and the Explication and Uſe of its Parts.</head>
                           <p>WE have thus far beheld the Coverings of the Brain, both the bony and the membranous, alſo the Arteries and Veins growing and knit to them, like Ivy, and diſtributed through the whole compaſs of the Head. There now remains, theſe coverings being removed, that we next conſider the Fabrick and true Hypotype or Character of the Brain and its Appendix, together with the action and uſe of all the parts. And here at firſt ſight we meet with three things, to wit, the Brain, the oblong Marrow, and the Cerebel: of which the oblong marrow ſeems to be a common Trunk, to which the Brain and Cerebel grow like branches: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome contend the medullary Rope to be the principal part, and the Brain and Cerebel its dependences. But that it is otherwiſe appears by this, becauſe theſe bodies, both in the generation and diſpenſation of the animal Spirits, are of more
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:152521:150"/>
noble uſe than the oblong marrow; ſo that if the out-flowings of the Spirits from the Brain or Cerebel be ſhut up or hindred, the nervous Syſtem preſently ſuffers an Eclipſe; in the mean time, if this be primarily diſtempered, the Brain and Cerebel ſuffer not for its fault.</p>
                           <p>That we may begin with the Brain, it may be conſidered in a double reſpect; to wit, both as to its convex or exterior ſuperficies, as it is beheld in its proper ſite and poſition; and as to its interior cavity, to wit, as the Brain appears opened, its concave ſuperficies being expanded and turned upſide down. We have already taken care to delineate its true form or Type in either manner, by what hath been before ſaid, to wit, after what manner it is both within and without. There now remains, after its fabrick and conformation being rightly weighed, for us deſign its offices, and to ſhew the uſes of it and of every one of its parts. Concerning which, we ought to unfold in general, firſt, what the office of the whole Brain is, then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when we ſhall deſcend to particulars, there will come under conſideration, 1. The diviſion of the Brain, to wit, its double Hemiſphere, alſo the two Lobes or partitions of either. 2. The narrow crankling turnings and windings, or the gyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and convolutions or rolling together of the Brain. 3. Its double ſubſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> Cortical and Medullary. 4. The common Baſis of all, <hi>viz.</hi> the callous body. 5. Its ſubtenſion or <hi>Fornix.</hi> 6. The appenſion or circuit of the Brain over or above the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long marrow. 7. And what reſults from thence, the void ſpace or Ventricles made by its infolding together. Concerning theſe, we ſhall take notice of what things occur worth noting; concerning the ſmelling Nerves and their proceſſes, we ſhall inquire afterwards, when we ſhall ſpeak particularly of the Nerves.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The Brain is accounted the chief ſeat of the Rational Soul in a man, and of the ſenſitive in brute beaſts, and indeed as the chief mover in the animal Machine, it is the origine and fountain of all motions and conceptions. But ſome Functions do chiefly and more immediately belong to the ſubſtance of this, and others depend as it were mediately and leſs neceſſarily upon it. Among theſe, which of the former ſort are accounted the chief, are the Imagination, Memory, and Appetite. For it ſeems, that the Imagination is a certain undulation or wavering of the animal Spirits, begun more inwardly in the middle of the Brain, and expanded or ſtretched out from thence on every ſide towards its circumference: on the contrary, the act of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory conſiſts in the regurgitation or flowing back of the Spirits from the exterior compaſs of the Brain towards its middle. The Appetite is ſtirred up, for that the animal Spirits, being ſome-how moved about the middle of the Brain, tend from thence outwardly towards the nervous Syſtem. The reſt of the Faculties of this Soul, as Senſe and Motion, alſo the Paſſions and Inſtincts merely natural, though they depend in ſome meaſure upon the Brain, yet they are properly performed in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long Marrow and Cerebel, or proceed from them.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. In ſome Animals, the ſubſtance of the Brain is divided into two parts, as it were Hemiſpheres, diſtinct one from another almoſt through its whole thickneſs, even to the callous body, which is inſtead of a bottom; and in like manner alſo in all the Senſories, and in moſt of the other Organs of the neceſſary Functions, the Brain is as it were twofold, that there might be a proviſion made againſt the defect of one ſide by the ſupplement of the other. Further, in man, who hath a brain more large and capacious than other Creatures, either Hemiſphere is again ſubdivided into two Lobes, to wit, the Anterior and the Poſterior; between which a branch of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotidick Artery, being drawn like a bounding River to both, diſtinguiſhes them as it were into two Provinces. Certainly, this ſecond partition of the humane Brain alſo ſeems to be deſigned for its greater ſafety; that if perchance any evil ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to one or both the foremoſt Lobes, yet the latter, for that they are ſeparated, may avoid the contagion of the neighbouring and farther ſpreading evil: So the Brain, like a Caſtle, divided into many Towers or places of Defence, is thereby made the ſtronger and harder to be taken.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Alſo the univerſal frame of the Brain appears yet more divided and variegated within all its aforeſaid partitions; for all its whole exterior ſuperficies is made uneven and broken, with turnings and windings and rollings about, almoſt like thoſe of the Inteſtines. Thoſe Gyrations or Turnings going from the fore-part of the Brain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter with a creeping compaſs, and as it were a ſpiral circuit, encompaſſes both its Hemiſpheres, that they might mutually furniſh all the convolutions with a continued paſſage: in a more moiſt Brain, or long kept, the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> clothing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:152521:151"/>
every one, and collecting them together, is eaſily pulled away; and then the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or folds being opened and ſeparated one from another, the ſubſtance of the brain is ſeen to be plowed, or laid as it were with furrows; out of which ariſe banks or ridges of broken crevices, not in a direct ſeries, but croſs-wiſe; ſo that in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of every furrow, a convolution ariſing from the right ſide, is carried to the left, then others following next, being ſent from the left ſide, is drawn to the right, and ſo by turns the inequalities of the whole brain are variegated in this order.</p>
                           <p>If it be inquired into, what benefit its Turnings and Convolutions afford to the brain, or for what end its whole anfractuous or broken crankling frame is, we ſay, that the brain is ſo framed, both for the more plentiful reception of the ſpirituous aliment, and alſo for the more commodious diſpenſation of the animal Spirits for ſome uſes. As to the aliment to be beſtowed on the brain, becauſe it is required to be ſubtil and extremely wrought or elaborated; therefore it ought to be admitted, not by a more open paſſage, but only by very ſmall pores and paſſages. Wherefore that there might be ſufficient plenty of ſpirituous liquor ſupplied, it is not only drunk in every where in the plain ſuperficies of the brain from its Cortical ſubſtance; but that ſuperficies of the brain or Cortical ſubſtance is uneven and rough with folds and turnings about; that the ſpaces for the receiving the Juyce might be enlarged as much as may be: For the anfractuous or crankling brain, like a plot of ground, planted every where with nooks and corners, and dauks and mole-hills, hath a far more ample extenſion, than if its ſuperficies were plain and even. Further, thoſe crank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the brain do more fitly hide the ſanguiferous Veſſels, for that they are very ſmall and ſlender, and more ſafely keep them, being variouſly interwoven into one anothers infoldings, than if they ſhould be openly diſtributed; for ſo being careleſly laid, they would be liable to too frequent hurt.</p>
                           <p>But a reaſon and neceſſity of the turnings about in the brain, and not of leſſer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the other, is fetched from the diſpenſation of the animal Spirits. For as the animal Spirits, for the various acts of Imagination and Memory, ought to be moved within certain and diſtinct limited or bounded places, and thoſe motions to be often iterated or repeated through the ſame tracts or paths: for that reaſon, theſe manifold convolutions and infoldings of the brain are required for theſe divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of ordinations of the animal Spirits, to wit, that in theſe Cells or Store-houſes ſeverally placed, might be kept the ſpecies of ſenſible things, and as occaſion ſerves, may be taken from thence. Hence theſe folds or rollings about are far more and greater in a man than in any other living Creature, to wit, for the various and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold actings of the ſuperior Faculties; but they are garniſhed with an uncertain, and as it were fortuitous ſeries, that the exerciſes of the animal Function might be free and changeable, and not determined to one. Thoſe Gyrations or Turnings about in four-footed beaſts are fewer, and in ſome, as in a Cat, they are found to be in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain figure and order: wherefore this Brute thinks on, or remembers ſcarce any thing but what the inſtincts and needs of Nature ſuggeſt. In the leſſer four-footed beaſts, alſo in Fowls and Fiſhes, the ſuperficies of the brain being plain and even, wants all cranklings and turnings about: wherefore theſe ſort of Animals comprehend or learn by imitation fewer things, and thoſe almoſt only of one kind; for that in ſuch, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Cells, and parted one from another, are wanting, in which the divers Species and Ideas of things are kept apart.</p>
                           <p>But that in more perfect Animals, all the turnings about are made of a twofold ſubſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> Cortical and Medullary; the reaſon ſeems to be, that one part may ſerve for the production of the animal Spirits, and the other for their exerciſe and diſpenſation. For we may well think, that the animal Spirits are wholly or for the moſt part procreated in the Cortical ſubſtance of the brain; for this ſevers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives immediately from the blood the ſubtil liquor, and imbuing it with a volatile Salt, exalts it into very pure Spirits. It is obvious to every one, that the Arteries enter the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the brain with a more frequent inſertion of ſhoots, and inſtil to it a ſpirituous liquor; the leavings of which, or what is ſuperfluous, the Veins in like manner entring it, do ſup up and carry away; in the mean time, the more ſubtil portion being here ſet free, goes into Spirits. In truth, the blood waters the medullary ſubſtance of the brain in a very ſmall quantity; which ſeems truly to be rather for the ſake of exciting of heat, than that the animal Spirits ſhould there be generated by the flowing in of that blood. For indeed, the volatile Salt, which like Ferment, ſpiritualizes the ſubtil liquor ſtilled forth from the blood, is had more
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:152521:151"/>
copiouſly in the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the brain, rather than in its middle or marrowy part; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that part, being endued with an Aſhy colour, ſhews by its aſpect the ſperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Particles and Humor contained in them, in which Spirit and a volatile Salt very much abounds; yea and plainly reſembles an Armeniack ſmell, (ſuch as either part alike breathe forth.) In the mean time, the medullary part of the brain ſeems very like the oblong marrow and the ſpinal. But it is well enough known, that theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullary parts ſerve for the exerciſe and diſpenſation of the animal Spirits, and not for their generation. The ſign of which is, that where-ever an obſtruction happens in them, whatever is below, being deſtitute of the influx of the Spirits, ſuffers an Eclipſe; whence it follows, that the animal Spirits, irradiating the medullary Rope, are not produced in it, but flow in from elſewhere; and why ſhould not we think the ſame of the middle marrow of the brain? Truly, that this part is rather the Mart or Exchange of the Spirits than its Shop or Work-houſe, appears from hence, becauſe the Animals which excel in Memory, Imagination, and Appetite, are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a more ample marrow of the brain; as is obſerved in man and the more perfect four footed beaſts: and they who ſeem to have little need of thoſe Faculties, as the leſſer four-footed beaſts, alſo Fowls and Fiſhes have the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the brain greater, but the medullary part very ſmall. It is a familiar Experiment among Boys to thruſt a needle through the head of a Hen, and that ſhe in the mean time, whoſe brain is ſo pierced through, ſhall live and be well a long time. The reaſon of which is, becauſe the whole ſubſtance of the brain in theſe ſort of Animals is almoſt merely Cortical; wherefore from the ſuffering ſuch a hurt, (as long as the marrow remains unhurt) the Spirits are generated in a leſſer quantity, but their commerce to the neceſſaries of life, are not therefore preſently interrupted. Indeed the brains of Birds conſiſt almoſt wholly of a Cortical and Aſhy part; and the medullary part is exceeding ſmall, and is only like a ſmaller Nerve deſcending on either ſide from the ſubſtance of the brain it ſelf.</p>
                           <p>After the animal Spirits are begot by a conſtant afflux of the blood within the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Brain, being there begotten, having obtained a watry Vehicle, they flow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently more inwardly, and ſoon enter into the marrows, filling the furrows and baulks of all the turning and winding Crevices; from whence being carried farther through all the particular tracts of each marrow into the marrowy ſubſtance, which lyes under all the winding Crevices, as their common Baſis, they are brought at laſt into the <hi>Callous Body,</hi> as into a ſpacious field; where, as in a free and open place, theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits being newly produced, are expatiated or iſſue forth.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Indeed this medullary ſubſtance called the <hi>Callous Body,</hi> which chambering the more inward ſuperficies of the brain, receives into it ſelf the marrow of all the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Crevices, ſeems to be made for that end, and diſpoſed there for the ſame purpoſe; to wit, that the Spirits flowing into it on every ſide, might be ſtretched out as in their proper Sphere, and begin to exerciſe the acts of the animal Faculties. In this place, they which come out of the ſeveral winding Crevices, do meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and remain as in a publick <hi>Emporium</hi> or Mart; from whence, as occaſion ſerves, they are raiſed up, and drawn forth for the uſes of every Faculty. But whilſt they here remain at leiſure and not buſied, they become purified or refined more and more by a continual circulation: becauſe theſe Spirits new-born, do gently and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually flow on every ſide from the outmoſt bounds of this body (to wit, where this common marrow beſmears the hinder productions of the brain, or the border of either of its Hemiſpheres) towards the fore-part of this <hi>callous Body,</hi> where it is thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; and there, if there be need, they are employed on the act of the Imagination, or entring the ſhanks of the <hi>oblong Marrow,</hi> they actuate and inſpire the nervous <hi>Appendix:</hi> but what Spirits are remaining there, after theſe offices are ſerved, run forthwith into the <hi>Fornix,</hi> and paſſing through its paſſage, they are remanded back again to the hinder region of the brain by a certain circulation; and laſtly, after this manner, penetrating through the narrow paſſages of the <hi>Fornix,</hi> thoſe Spirits are made more ſubtil, and alſo, as it ſeems moſt likely, they perform in this circulary motion thoſe more ſubtil acts of the Phantaſie.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Truly, that we may here ſpeak ſomething of the <hi>Fornix,</hi> it ſeems that this part ſerves for a twofold uſe: <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, leſt the more inward ſides of the Brain hanging ſlack and looſly, might fall together among themſelves, or might be removed beyond the limits of a juſt protenſion or out-ſtretching; for they, not only by the coming between of the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> and by little cords drawn from it, cohere to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:152521:152"/>
the oblong marrow and the Cerebel; but beſides, the <hi>Fornix,</hi> like a Ligament or ſtring brought from one end of the brain to the other, conſtrains and keeps its whole frame in its due figure and ſituation. For this part purely medullar, and of the ſame ſubſtance with the callous Body, ſeems to be a certain proceſs of this, which ariſing more forward between the ſtreaked bodies, and falling upon the two ſhanks of the oblong marrow, firſt of all diſtinguiſhes them; afterwards, being ſeparated from them, is carried through the midſt of the cavity, and about the hinder part of the brain is divided as it were into two Arms, which being bent on both ſides, and again cleaving to the border of the <hi>callous Body,</hi> ſtrictly embrace the oblong marrow, and knit and firmly tye the hinder bulk of the brain to its Trunk, leſt it ſhould flow or ſlide forth. But the other, and that the more noted uſe of the <hi>Fornix</hi> ſeems to be what we but now mentioned; to wit, that the animal Spirits may immediately paſs through its paſſage from one end of the brain to the other, and ſo, as it were through the bill of a <hi>Pelican,</hi> they might be circulated into their own intorted belly.</p>
                           <p>That thoſe things which were but now declared concerning the <hi>Penetralia</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward receſſes of the Brain, may be the better underſtood, we will here add a Scheme of its Sphere turned inſide out, and ſtretched out as it were upon a plain, ſo that the concave and inmoſt ſuperficies of the <hi>callous Body,</hi> together with the <hi>Fornix,</hi> may be ſufficiently ſeen.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Shews with what motion and tendency of the Animal Spirits the Exerciſes of the Animal Faculties are performed within the Confines of the Brain: Alſo what the uſe of its Ventricles is.</head>
                           <p>HItherto ſetting forth the uſes and offices of the Brain, properly ſo called, and of its parts, we have ſhewed after what manner the animal Spirits are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created from the blood in this their principal Shop or Work-houſe; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what diverting places, they being newly brought forth, do depart of themſelves, and are there kept as it were in diſtinct Cloiſters or Cells to be drawn forth for the manifold Exerciſes of the animal Function. But becauſe theſe Spirits, ſo brought to perfection, and ready for their work within the ſame parts of the Brain, enter into other manner of motions, and divers ways of emanations; therefore before we proceed any further, for the ſearching out their tracts within the oblong Marrow and Cerebel, we ought to declare concerning theſe Spirits diſpoſed within the confines of the Brain it ſelf, with what forces they are furniſhed, in what form they unfold themſelves, and in what ways they diffuſe themſelves and go forward as often as being muſtered in due order, they produce the acts of the Imagination, Memory, Appetite, and other ſuperior Faculties of the Soul. But for as much as hereafter, when we have finiſhed the explication of the Head and nervous Appendix, we have reſolved, for a concluſion, to treat of the Soul of Brutes and its powers, I may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the preſent lay aſide this task; unleſs that in the mean time it may not ſeem amiſs to give a taſte only in general of theſe few things: <hi>viz.</hi> as there are two parts of the inferior Soul, or of Beaſts, to wit, the vital or flamy, being inkindled in the blood, and the ſenſitive or lucid, being diffuſed through the whole Head and its nervous dependences, the animal Spirits being continually produced in the Brain and in the Cerebel, do conſtitute a double as it were Root or Fountain of this lucid part: yea, the Spirits of either linage, for as much as they are continued both within thoſe Fountains, and from thence through the frame or ſubſtance of the nervous Syſtem, as it were under the ſame beamy <hi>Syſtaſis</hi> and contexture, they effect or cauſe the whole <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> or ſubſiſtency of the ſenſitive Soul.</p>
                           <p>But there happen to this Soul, becauſe it is apt to be moved with a various impulſe, and ſo to contract or dilate its ſpecies in the whole, or in part, for that reaſon divers manners both of Actions and of Paſſions, to wit, the Senſes, which we call its Paſſions; and Motions, which we name the Actions of the ſame. The formal reaſon of the former, <hi>viz.</hi> the Senſes, conſiſts in the retraction or drawing back of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or a flowing back towards their Fountains. For where ever the impreſſion of a ſenſible object is carried to this radiant or beamy contexture, preſently either the whole frame, or ſome portion of it, whereby it admits the ſpecies, is compelled to wag, and to be moved back, as it were to leap back and recede into it ſelf: on the contrary, the actions or motions of this Soul are made, for that this ſhadowy Spirit, being incited or ſtirred up in the whole, or in a certain part, unfolds it ſelf more largely, and by an emanation, and as it were a certain vibration of the Spirits, exerts or puts forth its virtue and force of acting.</p>
                           <p>Both the Senſes and Motions of this ſenſitive Soul are made either tranſient, when the Spirits, or its conſtitutive Particles, being moved ſomewhere in the Syſtem of the Nerves, draw together with them the containing parts, and deflect them with the like carriage or geſture with themſelves, as is obſerved in the five outward Senſes, and the local motions of the Members: or elſe, either both Actions and Paſſions are continuing, to wit, when both the Motions and Senſes are ſilently performed without any great agitation or moving of the body, or its parts, within the firſt Fountains of the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> the Head it ſelf. Theſe kind of Paſſions indeed, made within the ſubſtance of the Brain, are the common Senſe and Imagination; but the Actions are Memory, Phantaſie, and Appetite: and either of theſe, as to their beginnings and inſtincts, depend for the moſt part upon the outward Senſes.</p>
                           <p>Concerning the former, we take notice, that as often as the exterior part of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:152521:154"/>
Soul being ſtruck, a ſenſible impreſſion, as it were the Optick Species, or as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulation or waving of waters, is carried more inward, bending towards the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered bodies, a perception or inward ſenſe of the Senſation outwardly had or received, ariſes. If that this impreſſion, being carried farther, paſſes through the <hi>callous Body,</hi> Imagination follows the Senſe: Then if the ſame fluctuation of Spirits is ſtruck againſt the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Brain, as its utmoſt banks, it impreſſes on it the image or character of the ſenſible Object, which, when it is afterwards reflected or bent back, raiſes up the Memory of the ſame thing.</p>
                           <p>The active Powers of this Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> Local Motion, Memory, Phantaſie, and Appetite follow ſometimes immediately the Paſſions, ſometimes are induced apart from them upon other occaſions. For indeed the ſenſible impreſſion ſtriking the ſtreaked or chamfered bodies, oftentimes, the Brain being in no wiſe affected, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the local Motions to be retorted with a reciprocal tendency of the animal Spirits; ſo in ſleep (the Appetite knowing nothing of it) when pain troubles, preſently we rub the place, moving the hand to it: but more often, after that the ſenſible Species, having paſt from the common Senſory to the <hi>callous Body,</hi> hath ſtirred up the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the Spirits, reflecting from thence, and flowing back towards the nervous Appendix, raiſe up the Appetite and Local Motions, the Executors or Performers of the ſame: And ſometimes a certain ſenſible impreſſion, being carried beyond the callous Body, and ſtriking againſt the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Brain it ſelf, raiſes up other ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies lying hid there, and ſo induces Memory with Phantaſie, alſo often with Appetite and Local Motion aſſociates. Further, theſe active Powers, ſometimes upon other occaſions, are wont to be ſtirred up and exerciſed apart from Paſſion. In Man, the Rational Soul variouſly moves the ſenſitive, and at its pleaſure draws forth and brings into act its Powers, ſometimes theſe, ſometimes thoſe. Moreover, the blood boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up above meaſure, and by that means ſtriking impetuouſly the border of the Brain, excites the ſpecies of things lurking in it, and driving them forward towards the middle or marrowy part of the Brain, cauſes alſo the various Acts of the Phantaſie and Memory to be repreſented.</p>
                           <p>Concerning the aforeſaid interior or abiding Faculties, we ſhall at preſent further take notice, that their more perfect Exerciſes are chiefly and almoſt only performed by the Spirits already perfected and highly elaborated; for thoſe a making, or that are new made, being numerous, they very much obſtruct and hinder the acts of the animal Function: to wit, when from the Veſſels, on every ſide watering the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Brain, the ſubtil Liquor is plentifully inſtilled for the matter of the animal Spirits, this flowing inwardly ſtuffs all the pores and paſſages of the Brain, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes for that time the Spirits from their wonted tracts and orbs of expanſion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whilſt the chief reflection of the Brain and Spirits is celebrated, ſleep, or an Eclipſe of the animal Spirits happens; then waking returns, when from the Liquor inſtilled, the more ſubtil part is exalted into very pure Spirits, and at length the more watry, being partly reſolved into Vapours, is exhaled, and partly ſupped up by the paſſages of the Veins entring the ſubſtance of the Brain, or elſe is ſweat out into the vacuity lying under the callous Body. Concerning theſe I hope we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe more largely afterwards. In the mean time, that we may proceed to the reſt of the things propoſed, concerning the frame of the Brain, properly ſo called, there yet remains that we ſpeak of its Ventricles: But ſince they are only a vacuity reſulting from the folding up of its exterior border, I ſee no reaſon we have to diſcourſe much of their office, no more than Aſtronomers are wont of the empty ſpace contained within the vacuity of the Sphere.</p>
                           <p>But in truth, as there is nothing met with in Nature that is not deſtinated to ſome uſe, ſurely we ſuſpect this ſame <hi>Vacuum</hi> or empty ſpace not to be built in vain within the Globe of the Brain. The Ancients have ſo magnified this Cavern, that they affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it the Shop of the animal Spirits, both where they themſelves were procreated, and performed the chief works of the animal Function. But on the other ſide, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns or thoſe of later days have eſteemed theſe places ſo vile, that they have affirmed the ſame to be mere ſinks for the carrying out the excrementitious matter. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that opinion of the Ancients is eaſily overthrown, for that the animal Spirits, being very ſubtil, and apt to fly away, require not ſuch large and open ſpaces, rather than the more narrow paſſages and little pores, ſuch as are made in the ſubſtance of the Brain: for theſe Spirits (becauſe they ought, for the various Faculties of the Soul, to be compoſed into various ſeries, and divers orders and diſpoſitions, therefore)
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:152521:154"/>
ought to be moved within peculiar orbs and tracts. Further, if any one ſhall exactly conſider the fabrick of the Brain, and ſeriouſly weigh, that theſe Ventricles are not formed out of the primary intention of Nature, but reſult only ſecondarily and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally from the complication of the Brain, he will be far from thinking, that the ſupreme ſeat of the Soul is fixed there, where being hem'd in with a moſt noble Guard of Spirits, it doth execute and perform its Functions. For it neither appears at all out of what matter, and by what artifice the Spirits are there begotten, nor by what ways of emanation they are derived from thence into the other parts of the Brain and nervous Syſtem. Wherefore almoſt all Anatomiſts, who are of a later Age, have attributed that vile office of a Jakes or ſink to this more inward chamber of the Brain. To which Opinion there has been ſome truſt given, for that theſe Ventricles are often ſeen in the dead to be filled with water; alſo from theſe, ways ſeem to lye open for excretion, both towards the Tunnel, and alſo into the Sieve-like Bone. It is obſerved, that where-ever the blood flows more copiouſly into any part, and waters it, there Vapors or watry Humors are begotten from the ſuperfluous Serum left in the circulation, which for the moſt part either exhale out through vaporous Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via's, or are brought back into the blood by the Veins or Lymphatick Veſſels. But when the blood, by a plentiful influx, waters not only the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Brain, but the interior marrow alſo, it remains, that the ſerous <hi>Latex</hi> (when-ever it abounds more in the blood, than that its ſuperfluities may be reduced immediately by the Veins, or by the Lymphaeducts, if they be there, or may be ſeparated by the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula's) ſhould ſlide down into this den, made hollow within the infolding of the Brain. Truly there are many inſtances, which plainly evince, that the ſerous humors are ordinarily laid up in the Ventricles of the Brain. Anatomical Obſervations of men dying of many Cephalick diſeaſes, and eſpecially of ſoporiferous or ſleepy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, confirm this. Yea, it may be lawfully thought, that natural ſleep follows, for that the Pores and paſſages of the Brain are occupied and ſtuffed with a watry <hi>Latex,</hi> which ſerves for a Vehicle to the Spirits. Then as often as a profound ſleep invades any one from a Surfeit, or drinking of Wine, the cauſe is, that the little ſpaces in the medullary ſubſtance of the Brain, deſtinated for the motions of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, are too much obſtructed by a Narcotick or a watry humor: certain reliques of which, being reſolved into vapor, and thruſt out from the company of the Spirits, do often ſweat out, or drop into this <hi>Vacuum</hi> or empty ſpace.</p>
                           <p>After this manner, it may be believed concerning the Ventricles of the Brain, or the empty ſpace left within its plicature or folding together. But in truth, becauſe this matter hath been very much controverted among Phyſicians of every Age, and the right deciſion of it ſeems to be of great moment, for the explicating the offices of the other parts of the Head; I will here compare together the reaſons for and againſt this Opinion, that we may at length give our Judgment of this Opinion, what may be either true, or moſt likely.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> It is inquired into, whether the ſerous Humors, heaped together within the Vacuity of the Brain, be ſent out by the Pituitary Glandula and the Sieve-like Bone, or not?</head>
                           <p>SInce Experience teſtifies, that the Serum and excrementitious, I may juſtly ſay morbifick, and oftentimes deadly Humors, are found frequently within theſe Ventricles of the Brain; we ought to inquire more diligently concerning their paſſage in and out: and the rather, for that it is very much doubted by ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the uſe of theſe Dens, nor are there wanting thoſe in this late Age, who have endeavoured to bring into vogue the ancient Opinion, though long ſince exploded, concerning the Spirits being begot in this place, and here exerciſed. I believe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubting, for the reaſons before alledged, that the Spirits are not here begotten, nor exerciſed: and no leſs certain is it made by Experience, that the ſerous Colluvies is here often gathered together. This therefore only remains, that we ſhould ſee
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:152521:155"/>
from whence, and how this flows hither, and then by what ways of Excretion the ſame ſhould be carried out.</p>
                           <p>As to the firſt, it is exceeding probable, that the ſerous <hi>Latex,</hi> which is the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle of the Spirits newly produced, and is introduced together with them into the Pores of the Brain, after it is grown ſtale, and being attenuated into Vapour, doth diſtil forth into this Cavern, and there at laſt grows into a watry Humor: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe what becomes of that Humor, or into what other Receptacle could it be derived? Beſides this ordinary, and I believe aſſiduous heaping together of the ſerous Colluvies within the Ventricles of the Brain, certainly it may be believed, that this kind of ſerous Humor is diſtilled out of the Glandula's inſerted in the <hi>Choroeidal</hi> infolding, being too much filled, into the Ventricles ſo called. I have often ſeen in a Dropſie the Glandula's of the Brain to be intumified, and like grains of Barley, burſting with too much wet, to become flaccid or withered, ſo that they could not retain the fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities brought to them, but continually diſpoſed them into the Cavity beneath. Truly in a Dropſie of the Brain theſe Cavities or Ventricles are always ſeen to be full of water; the cauſe of which kind of diſtemper is, the blood being made more watry, puts off in its circulation a greater heap of Serum than the Veins can preſently carry back, or the Glandula's are able to receive and retain. For indeed, that the Serum, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounding on every ſide from the Veſſels, may the better ſlide into the Ventricles of the Brain, it is ſo ordered, that the greater infoldings of the Veſſels, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted Glandula's, ſhould be diſpoſed near all the Ventricles of the Head: becauſe, not only the infolding <hi>Choroeides</hi> is placed nigh the concourſe of the three Ventricles in the Brain, but another infolding, and no leſs noted, (which we above deſcribed) with greater Glandula's, is ſet behind the Cerebel nigh the fourth Ventricle. In all, as it ſeems, for that end ſuch care is taken, that the watry part, coming from the blood, which is deſtinated either for the Brain or the Cerebel, for that it is not fit for the procreating of Spirits, might run into theſe infoldings of the Veſſels. But yet if a greater plenty of Serum be there laid up, than can be contained in them, or may be ſent away outwardly, whatever is ſuperfluous will ſlide into the Cavity under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath.</p>
                           <p>Hence it appears, from whence, and by what means the ſerous heap is gathered together within the Ventricles of the Brain: certainly to deny this going out is no other than to aſſert every ones Brain big with a Viper, which cannot be brought forth but by gnawing aſunder the bowels of its parent. Who ſhall lightly conſider the parts nigh the Ventricles, and their Fabricks, at firſt ſight only would ſwear with the Ancients, that the excrements of the brain were laid aſide both lower through the Tunnel into the Palate, and above or more forward through the mammillary Proceſſes into the Noſtrils: But if the ſtructure of theſe parts be a little more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſearched into, there is no body who preſently will not eaſily think, that by neither of theſe ways the excretion of any humor can be made; for neither from the pituitary Glandula through the Wedge-like bone, nor from the mammillary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes through the holes of the Sieve-like bone, is there any manifeſt aperture or opening to be perceived. But in very truth, we do ſuppoſe that the brain is in ſome meaſure purged by both theſe Emunctories, for that objection may be anſwered, That the tranſlations of Humors in living Creatures are eaſily performed through places that ſeem impervious or unpaſſable; for while the Pores and paſſages in all the parts of a living Creature are dilated by ſpirit and heat, they tranſmit the rain of the Serum as through the fine texture of a woolen Cloth. This plainly appears from Arthritick diſtempers, in which the ſerous <hi>Latex</hi> creeps by degrees through the nervous bodies, and paſſing through very ſmall ſpaces, makes a falling down of humors ſometimes upon theſe parts, and ſometimes upon others; ſo that it is obvious, that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes and nervous Proceſſes drink in the ſerous humors like Sponges, and then by a light compreſſion render them by heaps, as is manifeſt in the Tooth-ach; for as often as a Bodkin or Inſtrument is put up into a hollow Tooth, clear water will come out plentifully. Indeed, in the body of a living Creature the paſſages of humors are not only made through open paſſages and chanels; but the thinner and more watry <hi>Latex</hi> creeps through the ſolid and ſmooth bodies of the Nerves, as alſo the Fibres and the Membranes, as through the holes of a Filtre, and ſo is transferred through impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtraits from place to place. I ſometime knew in the Impoſtume of the Lungs the humor to have been derived through the Membranes growing to the <hi>Pleura</hi> from the bag into an Iſſue made in the ſide, and ſo the ſpitting ceaſing, the diſeaſe that ſeemed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:152521:155"/>
otherwiſe incurable, was healed by ſuch a way of Evacuation. Why in like manner may we not ſuppoſe the ſerous humors falling down from the Ventricles of the Brain into the pituitary Glandula, and the mammillary Proceſſes to be carried away through the Nerves or Membranes paſſing through here or there?</p>
                           <p>Concerning the Tunnel, the thing is probable enough; becauſe the poſition and ſtructure of this ſeem to ſhew, that ſome humor is carried out of the Ventricles of the Brain towards the pituitary Glandula. For this part is ſo conſtituted, that a falling down of the humors may be made from every angle and receſs of the interior Brain and its Appendix into its aperture or opening. And as in ſeveral Animals, the figure and ſite of the Ventricles vary very much, (as we have already ſhewn) yet in every one of them all the Ventricles of the Head, whatſoever they be, have their openings gaping towards the Tunnel. But that this Kernel or Glandula, to which the paſſage of the Tunnel is inſerted, receives and carries out the ſerous humors, ſeems alſo to appear from hence; becauſe it admits, not only thoſe falling from the brain into its Pores, but alſo thoſe ſecreted from the blood aſcending into the brain: For that in many four-footed beaſts, certain Veſſels are inſerted to this Glandula from either Carotidick Artery, which intimately enters its ſubſtance: a ſign of which is, that Ink being injected into the Trunk of either Artery, dyes with a black colour the wonderful Net, if it be there, and oftner the interior ſubſtance of this Glandula: whence it may be argued, that the office of this Glandula is to receive the ſuperfluous ſeroſities; and it receives not only thoſe ſent away in the return from the brain, but ſometimes preoccupies or prevents them, and is wont to derive them from the blood before it is carried to the brain. And therefore this Glandula is very ſmall, if the ſuperfluities of the Serum be derived to it only from the brain; but greater, if they come to it alſo from the blood, to wit, as it executes either one or a double office, as we have already ſhewn at large.</p>
                           <p>But as to what reſpects the way of paſſing through, to wit, by which the humors, depoſited in this Glandula, are carried out, the vulgar Opinion is, that they do come away through the holes of the bone beneath into the Palate: wherefore in thoſe kind of Animals, who have the wonderful Net, and many of its ſhoots enter this Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula, more holes are made in the underlying bone. Further, if you take away the ditch or gutter of the Wedge-like bone, or the ſeat of this Glandula, cut off from the Skull, and pour water upon its holes being made bare from the Membrane, it paſſing preſently through the ſubſtance of the whole bone, will ſuddenly ſtill forth through other holes lying open in the ſides of the bone. Yet this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concludes nothing for the Opinion propoſed: becauſe theſe holes are wholly wanting in ſome Creatures, and very much in an humane Skull; in thoſe who have them, as in a Calf, eſpecially it is obſerved, that the ſame are filled by ſome hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Veſſels; into which if a black liquor be caſt by a Syringe, that paſſing through the ſubſtance of the bone, will go into many other Veſſels lying under the bone, and at length into the Trunk of the Jugular Vein; which certainly is a ſign that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are not carried from hence into the Palate. But as to the Veſſels which cover over the holes of the bone, and which more abundantly lye under the ſame, they ſeem to be either Veins or Lymphaeducts.</p>
                           <p>But among theſe it is lawful to conjecture, the chief means of Excretion, whereby the ſerous humors, laid up in the pituitary Kernel, may be carried out; to wit, that they are remanded back from it, as from moſt other Glandula's or Kernels, into the maſs of blood. In a Calf the thing lies open to ocular inſpection, nor is it to be doubted of other Animals, who have the admirable Net: becauſe, as the arterious branches, ſo alſo the veinous reach to this Glandula; which ſup up not only the humors depoſited from the Arteries, but alſo thoſe falling from the Ventricles of the Brain. Yea, it may be lawfully believed, that in a Man alſo, a Horſe, and in other Creatures, who want the ſtrange or wonderful Net, there are other Lymphaeducts or Water-carriers, or ſome ſuch kind of Veſſels, as are ſeen in the head of a Calf, that moſt certainly carry the humors from this Glandula. We cannot ſo eaſily find out their footſteps, becauſe, before theſe break out of their dens, the tracts of the Lymphaeducts, if there be any, would vaniſh. Nor can we find out theſe Veſſels in all, as in a Calf, by injection; becauſe the holes of the bone, by which, as by the leading of a thread, the injection arrives at, and dyes the Veſſels, otherwiſe lying hid, are wanting in moſt. No doubt but time will render ſufficiently manifeſt the reductions of the humors from the pituitary Glandula in other living Creatures: in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:152521:156"/>
the mean time, it may be lawfully ſuſpected, for that the ſeroſities in ſome are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded from thence into the bloody maſs, that in all it is done after the like or the ſame manner, although the ways of the paſſing do not yet ſufficiently lye open.</p>
                           <p>As to the other Emunctory of the Brain, to wit, whereby the ſerous humors, laid aſide from the Ventricles of the Brain into the mammillary Proceſſes, and thence are thought to be ſent away through the holes of the Sieve like bone: truly, concerning this way of Excretion, it is much more to be doubted, becauſe theſe holes in the defunct being covered over and fully ſtufft, with the inſertions of the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> and nervous Fibres, ſent on either ſide from the mammillary Proceſs, tranſmit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of humor, how clear ſoever it be. Further, there is nothing more certain, than that the ſerous humors are preſſed out from the Glandula's and extremities of the Veſſels ending within the Noſtrils into their Caverns; ſo beſides that 'tis ſcarce poſſible for the humors to deſcend thither from the brain, it is not abſolutely needful to ſuppoſe this ſort of means of Excretion. But that we may reaſon a little farther concerning theſe; if it may be lawful to argue from the proviſion, and from the effects of the parts, there is no reaſon but that I may probably believe, that ſome humors alſo do ſhower down from the Brain into the cavities of the Noſtrils: for it being ſuppoſed, that the ſerous humor paſſes through, not only open chanels, but the more ſtrict Pores and paſſages alſo of the Nerves, and creeping both through the Fibres and Membranes, as through the ſtraining or holes of a Filter or Strainer, is carried from place to place, (which it were eaſie to demonſtrate) what ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but that the ſame ſort of <hi>Latex</hi> may deſcend through the Fibres impacted in the holes of the ſtraining bone? For although in dead Creatures thoſe parts ſeem to be impervious or unpaſſable, yet during the life of the Animal the paſſages and blind ways of the nervous bodies, being dilated by Spirit and Heat, moſt eaſily tranſmit a copious humor wherewith they are watered.</p>
                           <p>The Sieve-like Bone in divers Animals is variouſly perforated for the manifold neceſſity and difference of ſmelling. A Proceſs from the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold nervous Fibres paſs through every one of its holes, and beſmear the inſide of the Noſtrils. But as the impreſſions of ſenſible things, or ſenſible Species, continued as it were by the undulation or waving of the animal Spirits, aſcend through the paſſages of theſe bodies ſtretched out from the Organ towards the Senſory; ſo the humidities wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the ſame bodies, for as much as ſometimes they may be more ſuperfluous than uſual, may diſtil into the Noſtrils through the ſame ways. For indeed ſuch humors as are perpetually to be ſent away from the brain, ought ſo copiouſly to be poured upon the Organs of Smelling, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter, when we ſhall ſpeak particularly of the ſmelling Nerves; in the mean time, that there is ſuch a way of Excretion opening into the Noſtrils, ſome obſervations, taken of ſick people troubled with Cephalick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, do further perſwade. I have known ſome very obnoxious to the Scotomy and Vertiginous diſtempers, who had great plenty of clear water that diſtilled forth about the end of the Fit; by which kind of Evacuation, as it were Critical, the Fit was wont to be ended. Not long ſince, a Virgin living in this City, was afflicted a long time with a moſt cruel Head-ach, and in the midſt of her pain much and thin yellow Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum daily flowed out from her Noſtrils: the laſt Winter this Excretion ſtopped for ſome time, and then the ſick party growing worſe in her Head, fell into cruel Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, with a ſtupidity; and within three days dyed Apoplectical. Her Head being opened, that kind of yellow <hi>Latex</hi> overflowed the deeper turnings and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Brain and its interior Cavity or Ventricles. I knew a Gentlewoman that was wont to be infeſted with a moſt cruel Head-ach, alſo with a Vertigo, and a frequent melting of the animal Spirits, or Swooning away; who when ſhe began to be better, after a grievous Fit, felt at firſt a creeping motion in the top of her Brain, as it were the ſliding down of water: then that motion paſſing a little more forwards and downwards, at length many drops of clear water diſtilled from her Noſtrils. This Symptom ſhe uſed to have ſo ordinarily, that the ſick Gentlewoman did not doubt but that this water ſtilled out from the brain it ſelf. I could here bring many other reaſons, which might ſeem to perſwade, that the Ventricles of the Brain, or the Cavity made by the complicature or folding up of its border, is a mere ſink of the excrementitious Humor; and that the humors there congeſted, are purged out by the Noſe and Palate: But it is time for us to haſten to other matters, and to paſs from the Brain, properly ſo called, to its Appendix, <hi>viz.</hi> the oblong Marrow and the Cerebel.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> The Actions and Uſes of the oblong Marrow, and of ſome of its Parts are unfolded.</head>
                           <p>WE will paſs now from the Brain to the explication of its Trunk, to which both it and the Cerebel do grow like Muſhrooms or large Excreſcences. This part is commonly called the Oblong Marrow; under which name we comprehend all that ſubſtance which reaches from the inmoſt Cavity of the callous Body, and conjuncture in the Baſis of the Head, to the hole of the hinder part of the Head; where the ſame ſubſtance, being yet farther continued, ends in the ſpinal Marrow.</p>
                           <p>The ſuperficies of the oblong Marrow, though it be made unequal with ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberances and proceſſes, yet it is not variegated or garniſhed with any turnings about, and involutions, as it is in the Brain and Cerebel; neither is its exterior and cortical ſubſtance, or of an Aſh-colour, and the interior, medullar or marrowy and white; but all its frame or ſubſtance is in a ſort marrowy or medullous: nor does it however appear pure and bright, but much darkened with fibres and hairs vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſtretched forth, and diverſly going out. To wit, its fibres being figured in various places, after a diverſe manner, in ſome places they are found chamfered, and as it were beamy, in others direct or ſtretched out at length, and in other places again circular.</p>
                           <p>The figure of this is forked, and as it were like the Poets <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> ſeems like the ter Y: for its ſhanks ariſing more forward from either Hemiſphere of the Brain, and inclining one to another, grow together near the centre of the Skull into one and the ſame Trunk; which notwithſtanding, a line being brought through the midſt, ſeems to be made as it were out of two ſtalks, and thoſe to be diſtinguiſhed in its whole proceſs.</p>
                           <p>The oblong Marrow ſeems to be a broad or high Road, into which the animal Spirits perpetually flow from their double Fountain, to wit, the Brain and the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, to be derived from thence into all the nervous parts of the whole Body: which Spirits, whilſt they are orderly diſpoſed in this common paſſage, as it were by ſeries and orders, carry a twofold aſpect; to wit, they are directed either outward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Nerves, when they exert the loco-motive Faculty, or they look inward towards their Fountains, when the acts of ſenſe, or rather the apprehenſions of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things are performed.</p>
                           <p>Within this open way, a more large and greatly open path leads ſtraight to the ſpinal Marrow, through which the Spirits flow forth to the Nerves, the Executors of ſpontaneous Motion in moſt members. In the mean time, out of the ſame tract of the oblong Marrow, leſſer paths are carried outwardly, here and there, by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Nerves, ariſing from the ſame, within the Skull. Alſo beſides, many diverting places, <hi>viz.</hi> various proceſſes and protuberances grow to this medullary Trunk, into which, the Spirits deſtinated to ſome peculiar offices, go apart: leſt that all the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits travelling this way and that way in the ſame path, ſhould meet one another and diſturb one anothers offices.</p>
                           <p>Whilſt after this manner, for the performing the acts of Motion and Senſe, we ſuppoſe the animal Spirits to be expatiated within the oblong Marrow; we affirm, that they are not there begotten, but only exerciſed. For indeed, they being created only in the Brain and Cerebel, as they proceed from this or that, they perform the offices, either of a merely involuntary Function, or elſe of a ſpontaneous, as ſhall be ſhewed more largely hereafter.</p>
                           <p>But that we may unfold here all things which belong to the oblong Marrow, I ſhall mete it forth from its firſt coming out to the end of its race, and handle its ſeveral <hi>Stadia,</hi> diverting places, and croſs ways. Where the callous Body is thought to end, the oblong Marrow begins; to wit, when the medullar ſubſtance of the Brain is thickeſt nigh the boſſes or knobs of either Hemiſphere, a body of a whitiſh colour and ſomewhat darkned or obſcured, and ſtreaked like Ivory, is joyned to that marrow on both ſides. Theſe two bodies are the extremities or tops of the ſhanks of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:152521:157"/>
Marrow; between which and the Brain there are nigh and very immediate commerces. Either of theſe ſeems as it were a Cylinder rolled about into an Orb, which nevertheleſs conſtitutes the top of either ſhank, not ſpherical, but oval, and ſomething bent downward in the hinder part. A more large portion of its ſuperficies is joyned to the medullar ſubſtance of the Brain; but yet ſome part of it, being free from the coheſion with the Brain, ſhews it ſelf apart, and makes that protuberance ſhewing it ſelf in either lateral Ventricle. Theſe bodies, if they ſhould be diſſected along through the middle, appear marked, with medullar ſtreaks, as it were rays or beams: which ſort of chamferings or ſtreaks have a double aſpect or tendency; to wit, ſome deſcend from the top of this body, as if they were tracts from the Brain into the oblong Marrow; and others aſcend from the lower part, and meet the aforeſaid, as if they were paths of the Spirits from the oblong Marrow into the Brain. And it is worth obſervation, that in the whole Head beſides there is no part found chamfered or ſtreaked after the like manner.</p>
                           <p>If the uſe of theſe be inquired into, this preſently occurs, that theſe bodies, placed between the Brain and its Appendix, are the great and common diverting places of either; to wit, which receive whatſoever impulſes or forces of the animal Spirits are ſent from either, and communicate them preſently to the other: Or that I may ſpeak more plainly, this part is the common Senſory, to wit, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, the firſt Senſory that receives the ſtrokes of all ſenſible things, dilated from the Nerves of every Organ, and ſo cauſes the perception of every ſenſe; which kind of ſtrokes of ſenſible things, when from hence they are paſſed further into the Brain, preſently Imagination ſucceeds the Senſe: and further, theſe bodies, as they receive the forces of all the Senſes, ſo alſo the firſt inſtincts of ſpontaneous local motions. To wit, as often as the Appetite diſcerns any thing to be done, preſently the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal tendencies of the animal Spirits, that is, from the Brain into theſe parts, are diſpoſed here to act the conceptions of motions coming from any part or member. For here, as in a moſt famous Mart, the animal Spirits, preparing for the performance of the thing willed, are directed into appropriate Nerves. That it is ſo, it appears, becauſe every influence from the Brain into the nervous ſtock, and on the contrary, from this into that, and the mutual commerce of the animal Spirits, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity paſs through theſe bodies. Wherefore all the Nerves, alſo thoſe which belong to the more inward Organs of the Senſes, ariſe behind theſe chamfered bodies. For the Optick and ſmelling Nerves creep through the ſuperficies of the Brain by a long paſſage and windings about, that they might be inſerted below this part of the oblong Marrow.</p>
                           <p>For indeed, the Species of ſenſible things, received by thoſe Nerves, might more immediately be carried to the middle of the Brain, unleſs that they ought firſt to be ſtaid at this Senſory. Further, we may lawfully conjecture, that theſe parts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the aforeſaid office from their chamfered, and as it were beamy contexture: For as thoſe chamferings, with which theſe bodies are marked, (as we but now inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated) are of a double kind, to wit, ſome deſcending, which look from the Brain towards the oblong Marrow; and others aſcending, which are carried diſtinctly from this towards that, it may be lawfully concluded, that in theſe carried up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the impreſſions of ſenſible things are perceived: and in thoſe tending down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are performed the Inſtincts of Motions.</p>
                           <p>Further, that theſe bodies, as was ſaid, perform the offices of the firſt Senſory, beſides the fabrick of their parts, and the Analogy to be collected thence of their uſe, it ſeems yet more certainly to appear from ſome Obſervations concerning theſe chamfered bodies, after what manner they are affected in Paralytick diſeaſes. For as often as I have opened the bodies of thoſe who dyed of a long Palſie, and moſt grievous reſolution of the Nerves, I always found theſe bodies leſs firm than others in the Brain, diſcoloured like filth or dirt, and many chamferings obliterated. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in Whelps newly littered, that want their ſight, and hardly perform the other faculties of motion and ſenſe, theſe ſtreaks or chamferings, being ſcarce wholly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, appear only rude.</p>
                           <p>The chamfered Bodies, inclining one to another near their blunt and greater angles, are almoſt contiguous; but that the Trunk of the <hi>Fornix</hi> intervenes with its twofold Root: yet in that place where the two Roots of the <hi>Fornix,</hi> being ſent ſtraight down, are inſerted into the callous Body, a tranſverſe medullar proceſs, like a great Nerve, ſtretched from one chamfered body to the other, as it were joyns the ſame, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:152521:157"/>
makes them to communicate one with the other. Certainly, this joyning together of the chamfered bodies is made, that their actions and paſſions may not be double: but though the ſpecies of the ſenſible object or conceptions of the motions to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, coming from the Brain or Senſory being double, are carried alſo double to the firſt Senſory; yet for as much as either ſubſtance or frame of this, communicates with the other, every impreſſion coming this or that way, becomes ſtill one and the ſame. For it may be obſerved, in the whole Head, that though almoſt all things are double, yet each of them communicate among themſelves, either by a contiguity, or by proceſſes ſent forth. And ſo as by the duplication of it, care is taken againſt the abſolute privation or defect of the act, ſo the joyning together of its duplicature provides againſt the empty or confuſe multiplication of the ſame ſpecies.</p>
                           <p>After this manner, the chamfered bodies in Man and four-footed Beaſts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly found of the ſame ſpecies or form, and in every one of them, figured after the ſame manner; and are as it were the Joynts that joyn the Brain to the ſhanks of the oblong Marrow. But we have already ſhewn, that in Fowls and Fiſhes, whoſe brains being alike, differ from thoſe of men and four-footed beaſts, the thing is ſomewhat otherwiſe: For in Fowls the callous body is wanting to the brain; but what ſerves inſtead of it, is found in the oblong Marrow, to wit, two little Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles ſhew themſelves nigh the chambers of the Optick Nerves, which are arched or chamber'd with a whitiſh ſubſtance, ſuch as the callous body is in man or four-footed beaſts. Then on the contrary, the chamfered bodies, or the parts which ſerve in their ſtead, in Fowls, are not a portion of the oblong Marrow after the uſual manner, but are entred into the Brain it ſelf. For near the fiſſure of the Brain, two Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes being marked with medullar chamferings, both diſtinguiſh either Hemiſphere of the Brain, and cover over its Ventricles. The ſtreaks or rays of either Membrane deſcend, and being concentred about the Baſis of the Brain, go together into a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullary proceſs, which is inſerted on both ſides to the oblong Marrow. So theſe parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the callous body, in which the animal Spirits are expanded, and the chamfered bodies, in which their paſſing to and fro is inſtituted, ſeem to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the head of Fowls. The reaſon whereof, (as I elſewhere hinted) unleſs I be deceived, is this: becauſe theſe Animals are of leſs excellency in Imagination and Memory than four-footed beaſts; yea alſo, for that the ſenſe and motion of them are their chief Faculties: therefore for the exerciſes of theſe to be performed with a greater expanſion of Spirits, the callous body is transferred into the oblong Marrow, and in its place the chamfered bodies are removed into the Brain.</p>
                           <p>About the lower end of either chamfered body the ſmelling Nerves are inſerted. For you may take notice, that the mammillary Proceſſes, a little more obſcure in man, but much more conſpicuous in brute Animals, who are endued with a more remarkable ſenſe of ſmelling, do paſs into firm and plainly whitiſh bodies of Nerves, which being dilated or brought nigh the lateral turnings and windings of the Brain, are implanted into the oblong Marrow on either ſide about the lower angle of either Ventricle behind the chamfered bodies; yet ſo, that the Tube or Pipe of either Nerve may open into the Cavity of the Ventricle, as we before ſhewed. After this manner theſe Nerves are carried by a long journey from the fore-part of the Brain, that they may bring the ſenſible ſpecies to the chamfered body, as to the common Senſory, firſt and rather than to the Brain. But we ſhall ſpeak of the ſmelling Nerves more particularly hereafter.</p>
                           <p>Where theſe chamfered Bodies end from either ſide, a marrowy ſubſtance ſucceeds, which being ſomewhat of a darkiſh colour going forward for ſome ſpace, is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by a peculiar bending forward from the other contiguous parts. This <hi>Galen</hi> (perhaps not improperly) calls the Chambers of the Optick Nerves; for in this place the Optick Nerves ſhewing themſelves from the higheſt region of either ſide, being carried downward with a certain compaſs, are united about the Tunnel. Then being divided again, and carried a little further, enter the Skull, going ſtraight forwards to either Senſory. The growing together of theſe Nerves, and their being again ſeparated, ſeems to be ordained for this end, that the viſible ſpecies, received from either Eye, might appear ſtill the ſame, and not double; for this conjunction of the twofold Organ frames the double image into one; which once united, when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it is carried to either ſide of the common Senſory, for that it is on both ſides alike, appears ſtill the ſame. If at any time, through drunkenneſs, or a diſtortion of the Eyes, the object appears double, and two Lights upon a Table, it is becauſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:152521:158"/>
the image of the ſame thing is received after a different manner by one Eye than the other, for that reaſon the objects are repreſented like two diſtinct things. For that this Eye is diſtorted after one manner, and that after another, the ſame Species, coming to either Pupil by a diverſe angle of incidence, appears diverſe or double. There is another reaſon of the coalition of the Optick Nerves, to wit, that one Eye being hurt, all the viſible animal Spirits might be beſtowed on the other. Further, for that theſe Nerves are carried with a long paſſage, their uniting helps to their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtrength and ſupport.</p>
                           <p>Whereas the Optick Nerves ariſe here from the oblong Marrow, all or its moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate ſubſtance is not beſtowed upon them; but theſe Nerves are inſerted into the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullar Trunk, as branches of a Tree to the ſtock, that ſo they may receive by that means the influence of the Spirits, and by this way tranſmit the Species of viſible Things. In the mean time, this more inward ſubſtance of the oblong Marrow is the common paſſage both to the Eyes and to the other nervous Syſtem ariſing more backward: through which, by the going and returning to and fro of the animal Spirits, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes of ſenſible things, and the inſtincts of Motions between the Brain and the other nervous parts, which depend upon it, are performed. Foraſmuch as the ſmelling and ſeeing Nerves ariſe ſo near the chamfered bodies, the reaſon hence is plain, why odors or the objects of the ſenſe of ſmelling ſo ſtrike the Brain it ſelf, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately affect it; alſo why there is ſo exceeding ſwift a communication between Sight and Imagination.</p>
                           <p>Concerning the Optick Nerves in a man, (which alſo in ſome meaſure is after the ſame manner in other living Creatures) we ſhall advertiſe you, that when they, after their uniting or mixing together, being preſently again ſeparated, do go out of the Skull, the ſanguiferous Veſſels going out of the Skull with them, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either Nerve even to the Baſis of the Eye, are knit into the Trunk of either. There is a noted ſhoot of the Artery deſtinated to this office, carried from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior branches of the <hi>Carotides.</hi> Hence, as I ſuppoſe, a reaſon may be given, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when by drinking or more plentiful eating, a ſleepineſs is cauſed, preſently a great heavineſs, and as it were an oppreſſion, is felt about the Eyes. For when the blood, very much boiling up, fills above meaſure the Veſſels watering the Brain, and by diſtending them, obſtructs the Pores of the Brain, thoſe Nerves alſo from the blood in like manner boiling up within the Optick Veſſels, are preſſed together in their whole paſſage.</p>
                           <p>In Fowls and Fiſhes this chamber of the Optick Nerves, bunching out with a great bulk, is not much leſs than the Brain it ſelf; for, as we but now intimated, what is inſtead of the callous body is placed here; and in this place the animal Spirits ſeem to have their chief Mart or Empory in a moſt large medullar chamber, or the Sphere of their Expanſion. And ſo, when from hence the animal Spirits are derived from ſo full and plentiful a Store-houſe, it is for that reaſon Fowls are furniſhed with ſo curious an Eye, and with ſo highly perſpicacious and acute a ſight. And the ſame perhaps may hold concerning Fiſhes, if that we conſider the ſight in theſe is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a thicker Medium, and often double.</p>
                           <p>In ſome Animals, in the midſt of theſe chambers of either Optick Nerve, the ſhanks of the oblong, Marrow a little opening, Leave a chink or aperture, which receiving the ſeroſities coming from every region of the Brain and its Appendix, ſends them through the Tunnel into the pituitary Glandula.</p>
                           <p>There is no need that we ſhould diſcourſe much here of the Tunnel and the pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Glandula, becauſe, already ſpeaking of the Ventricles of the Brain, or the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty ſpace left within its plicature, we fell occaſionally on the conſideration of both theſe; where we ſhewed, that the ſerous humors, which were wont to be heaped together within many places of the Brain and of its Appendix, do all ſlide down on every ſide from each angle and receſs of it into the ſteep opening of the Tunnel; and ſo there is a neceſſity that they ſhould be poured out by it into the pituitary Glandula. Further, it is manifeſt, that this Glandula, in ſome Animals, is charged with a double office; to wit, as it receives the ſeroſities ſent from above from the Brain, ſo alſo it ſeparates the humors from the blood brought to the ſame from the wonderful Net by the Arteries, and prepoſſeſſing them, imbibes them before their ingreſs to the Brain. Wherefore this part is furniſhed with a ſubſtance of a double kind: <hi>viz.</hi> one reddiſh, more thin, and interwoven with Blood-carrying Veſſels, which conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes either ſide of it; and the other more white placed in the middle, to which the Tunnel is inſerted.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of the Uſes of the Pineal Glandula and the Choroeidal Infolding; alſo of the orbicular Prominences which are commonly called <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes;</hi> and other Parts which ſeem to be dependences of them.</head>
                           <p>BElow the Chambers of the Optick Nerves in a common Valley which lyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the tops of theſe and the Buttock-form Prominences, is placed the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal Glandula or Kernel in form of a Pine-apple, called alſo <hi>Conarium;</hi> this is not only found in Man and four-footed beaſts, but Fowls and Fiſhes alſo are endued with the ſame. Wherefore, although from hence it may be concluded, that this is of neceſſary uſe; yet we can ſcarce believe this to be the ſeat of the Soul, or its chief Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to ariſe from it; becauſe Animals, which ſeem to be almoſt quite deſtitute of Imagination, Memory, and other ſuperior Powers of the Soul, have this Glandula or Kernel large and fair enough.</p>
                           <p>It is obſerved in all Animals of every kind and form, that to this Glandula, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways placed nigh the holes or paſſages, open to the Tunnel, the Choroeidal Infolding is continually joyned; yea this infolding (ſeeming to hang from the Pineal Kernel ſuſtaining its middle Proceſs, as it were by a nail or haſp, from thence) is divided into two wings ſtretching out on either ſide upon the ſhanks of the oblong Marrow, Wherefore we may juſtly ſuſpect, that this Glandula is chiefly made for the ſake of this infolding; and that the office of it is no other than of other Kernels, which are placed nigh the concourſe of the ſanguiferous Veſſels: to wit, that it may receive and retain within it the ſerous humors depoſited from the arterious blood, till the Veins being emptied, may ſup them back, or the Lymphaeducts (if there be any there) may convey them outwardly. For it is obſerved, that the Choroeidal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding is beſet with very many leſſer Glandula's or Kernels, and every where inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with them, which imbibe the Serum ſecreted from the blood, in the ſmaller Veſſels; therefore for this very ſame office, where all the Veſſels concur, this Kernel is placed, of a bigger bulk, that it might be able to receive and contain the ſeroſities there plentifully depoſited. Moreover, it is of no ſmall moment, that this Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula ſuſtains and keeps duly ſtretched out the <hi>Chroeidal</hi> infolding otherwiſe hanging looſe, and apt to fall down into it ſelf, or at leaſt to ſlide out of its proper place. Wherefore I have often taken notice in the Dropſie of the Brain, that this <hi>Glandula</hi> being looſned at the roots by too much moiſture, and often broken off, and removed from its place, the <hi>Choroeidal</hi> infolding hath ſlid together from its proper expanſion, and ſlip'd down lower, and alſo ſuffered its Veſſels to be folded together diſorderly.</p>
                           <p>From theſe things thus premiſed concerning the pineal Glandula, it will not be difficult to aſſign alſo the uſe of the <hi>Choroeidal</hi> infolding: Concerning which there will be little need to refel that Opinion of the common ſort, which aſſerts, That the animal Spirits, to be beſtowed upon the whole Brain, are begot in this infolding: becauſe the Veſſels of this inſtil nothing to the ſubſtance of the Brain or its Appendix, for that they are no where inſerted to it; but it was before ſhewn, that the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Brain, or the Cavity in which theſe ſame Veſſels are hung, do not at all contain the Spirits; which further appears more plain, becauſe in Cephalick diſeaſes thoſe Ventricles are filled with water, and the continuity of the infolding is diſſolved by too much moiſture, when in the mean time the ſick are indifferently ſtrong in the exerciſe of the animal Faculties.</p>
                           <p>But indeed we ſuppoſe, that this infolding ſerves for a twofold office: <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, that the more watry part of the blood, deſtinated for the Brain, might be ſent away into its Veſſels, to the end, that the remaining portion of the bloody <hi>Latex</hi> might become more pure and free from dregs to be diſtilled forth into Spirits; even as is wont to be done in a Chymical Diſtillation, to wit, when there is a peculiar Receiver fitted for the receiving of the Phlegm by it ſelf, more ſincere, pure, and ſubtil Spirits are inſtilled into the other more noted Receiver. The more watry blood entring the arterious Veſſels of this Infolding, being carried from them into the Veins, is remand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back towards the Heart. In the mean time, leſt the Serum, too much redound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:152521:160"/>
and boiling up in theſe Veſſels, might hinder circulation, its ſuperfluities are received for ſome time both by the leſſer Glandula's thickly inſerted, and alſo by the pineal Kernel.</p>
                           <p>The other and no leſs noted uſe of this Infolding, is to conſerve the heat of the blood boiling within the complications of the Veſſels, and as it were circulating about, being excited as from a fire-place within the infolding of the Brain. For though the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> need not implant thick ſhoots of Veſſels in the callous Body and inward Marrows of the Brain, for that they are rather dedicated to the Exerciſe than to the Generation of the animal Spirits; yet that the heat requiſite for the circulation of the Spirits, might be kept conſtantly in that place, this infolding is hung upon the whole neighbourhood. For as the blood, aggeſted or heaped together within the Cavities of the Boſoms, is inſtead of an hot Bath, whereby the animal Spirits are diſtilled plentifully into the outmoſt and cortical part of the brain; ſo the blood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the ſmall Veſſels of this infolding, ſeems to be in the place of a leſſer and more temperate Bath, whereby the ſame Spirits might be fitly circulated in the more inward and medullar ſubſtance.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, Another reaſon may alſo be given, why the Choroeidal infolding is found always within the Ventricles or Cavity of the Brain, made by its infolding, and after what manner ſoever figured; to wit, that another ſort of commodity might reſult from thence; that when the Veſſels of that Infolding, carrying too watry blood, lay aſide more Serum than the Glandula's are able to receive or contain, what is ſuperfluous might ſlide down opportunely into the underlying Cavity, as into a Sink. Wherefore the <hi>Pineal Glandula,</hi> though ſet in a more eminent place, is however placed always near the hole or paſſage that lyes open towards the Tunnel in every brain.</p>
                           <p>Next to the Pineal Kernel are found in the upper ſuperficies of the oblong Marrow certain noted Prominences, which are commonly called <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Teſtes.</hi> Theſe being placed near together, do conſtitute as it were four Mole-hills, which yet are joyned one to another by certain proceſſes. Beneath theſe Mole-hills, or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the joyning of them and the trunk of the oblong Marrow, placed underneath, a narrow and long Cavity or Den is left, which by ſome Anatomiſts is called the fourth Ventricle; but according to others later, who place the fourth Ventricle under the Cerebel, this Cavity is affirmed to be a paſſage to it.</p>
                           <p>The hinder extremity of this Den ends nigh the beginning of the fourth Ventricle; the more fore-extremity of it opens before the former Mole-hills or little bulkings out, called <hi>Nates.</hi> From the midſt of this Cavity or narrow Den a paſſage goes ſtraight to the Tunnel. It is very much controverted among Anatomiſts concerning the ſite of theſe parts, and of their dependency on one another, and of other parts, and of their uſe: Concerning which this is firſt to be noted, as we hinted above, that theſe four Protuberances are far greater in ſome brute Animals than in a Man, as in a Sheep, Calf, Goat, and the like; alſo in a ſound, dry, and old Head they are more conſpicuous, and their proceſſes, joynings, and habitudes may be more eaſily noted than in a younger, moiſt, or otherwiſe ſickly brain. Indeed the uſe of theſe (unleſs my conjecture deceives me) ſeems far more noble, than that they ſhould deſerve thoſe vile names of <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Teſtes,</hi> Buttocks and Teſticles.</p>
                           <p>Notwithſtanding, to what office theſe parts were deſigned, neither have the ancient Anatomiſts delivered, nor will it, by the help of Reaſon, be eaſie to gueſs for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. We have already ſhewn, that theſe aforeſaid Prominences ought not to be taken for the two ſhanks either of the Brain or Cerebel bending back one towards another, and ſo growing together into the oblong Marrow. For although from this ſuppoſition a very neat Hypotheſis may be made for the oeconomy of the animal Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to wit, by affirming that theſe double ſhanks, on either ſide, were ſo many diſtinct ways of paſſage through which the animal <hi>Spirits,</hi> for the performing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, flowed from the Brain and Cerebel into the oblong Marrow, and returned thence from this into thoſe for the performing the acts of the Senſes: yet from our Method of Diſſecting it plainly appears, that the brain is not fixed to the oblong Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row nigh this place, but far above it; ſo that indeed the anterior Prominences, unleſs mediately only, <hi>viz.</hi> by the chamfered bodies, receive not any portion of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullar ſtock, or any influence from the brain, nor can have any dependency from it. Beſides, if the Protuberances called <hi>Nates</hi> were ſhanks of the brain, why ſhould the ſame be in man, (he having got the greateſt brain, the leaſt) or at leaſt leſſer than
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:152521:161"/>
in moſt other living Creatures? Then between the Prominences called <hi>Teſtes</hi> and the Cerebel, although there happens a certain communication; yet it ſeems that there lyes open a paſſage from thoſe little lumps into the Cerebel, and not from this, through them into the oblong Marrow. For out of theſe aforeſaid Prominences a medullar Proceſs aſcends obliquely on either ſide into the Cerebel, by whoſe paſſage the animal Spirits, tending from one ſtage to the other, cauſe a mutual commerce between thoſe parts and the Cerebel: But indeed the Proceſſes which lead from the Cerebel into the oblong Marrow, and carry to it its influences, being diſtinct from the former, ſtand ſomewhat lower, as ſhall be more clearly ſhewn hereafter, when we ſhall ſpeak of the Cerebel.</p>
                           <p>But in the mean time, concerning the offices and uſes to which the aforeſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberances ſerve, we ſhall make this conjecture. The animal Spirits perpetually flow out and leap back again from the fountain the brain into the oblong marrow, ſo that there may be had a conſtant commerce between the brain and many organs of ſenſe and ſpontaneous motion: from which thoſe parts are entertained which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their actions, not at the beck of the Appetite, but either by the inſtinct of Nature, or the blind impulſe of the Paſſions; for ſuch receive wholly their influences from the Cerebel, as afterwards ſhall be more fully ſhewed. Whilſt therefore the Spirits, flowing from the brain, abound in the oblong marrow, it is fit that ſome of them ſhould be carried from thence into the Cerebel: (for what uſes this ought to be done, ſhall be told by and by) wherefore from either ſide of the oblong marrow a Protuberance grows forth, into which indeed the Spirits deſigned for the Cerebel, may go apart from the common paſſage of the oblong marrow; and theſe Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences are the former, which are commonly called <hi>Nates,</hi> and, as we have ſaid, are far greater in moſt brute Animals than in man (the reaſon of which ſhall be declared anon.) The other hinder Protuberances, commonly called <hi>Teſtes,</hi> grow to theſe former, and are only certain Epiphyſes or Excreſcences of them, as it were the heads of the medullary Proceſſes, which are from thence carried by an oblique aſcent into the Cerebel; for when the animal Spirits aſcend from the former Prominences into the Cerebel, they enter theſe latter firſt, as it were the more large beginnings or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trances of their paſſage, from whence they go forward by the paſſage of the medullar Proceſſes into the Cerebel.</p>
                           <p>Beſides we may take notice, that when the animal Spirits are carried out of the oblong marrow into the greater natiform Prominences to be derived towards the Cerebel, they, according to their cuſtom, (as often as they tend towards the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſory from a double Organ of any Faculty) ought to be confounded and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled together before they enter the Cerebel: wherefore both the firſt Prominences, and alſo the ſecond growing to them are joyned together with certain Proceſſes like wings reaching one another; which connexion indeed of them, becauſe it ought to be diſtinguiſhed every where from the medullar Trunk lying under it hence, from the ſeparation or empty ſpace that comes between the oblong marrow and the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of the Prominences, that cavity ariſes, which is by ſome called the fourth Ventricle, and by others the paſſage to it.</p>
                           <p>If it be yet farther inquired, to what end the animal Spirits are carried by this by-paſſage from the common paſſage of the oblong marrow into the Cerebel, and thence back again; I ſay, that this is done for a twofold reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> both that the Paſſions or Affections of the ſenſitive Soul, begun from the brain, may be tranſmitted to the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera;</hi> then ſecondly, that the natural Inſtincts, excited in the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> might be communicated to the brain. Theſe reciprocal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merces which are had between the brain and the Organs of involuntary Functions, ought to be inſtituted or performed by this private paſſage, leſt otherwiſe the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of theſe involuntary Faculties ſhould very much diſturb the acts of the outward Senſes, or the intentions of ſpontaneous motions.</p>
                           <p>As to the firſt, it is obſerved, that by every paſſion of the ſenſitive Soul, as from Anger, Sadneſs, Pleaſure, and other Affections, the <hi>Praecordia</hi> are diſturbed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will or no; which variouſly dilate or conſtrain themſelves, and ſo ſtir up in the blood divers fluctuations. Moreover, from this kind of force of the Paſſions the countenance or the aſpects of the Face are wont to be altered and diſtorted after va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ways. The reaſon of all theſe ſeems to be, becauſe when the animal Spirits, exiſting within the brain, are moved according to the Idea of the conceived Paſſion, the other Spirits alſo flowing within theſe diverting places, being in like manner
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:152521:161"/>
moved, affect the Cerebel, and that coming between, the original of the Nerves, ſerving to the <hi>Praecordia, Viſcera,</hi> and Muſcles of the Face, and ſo the parts to which thoſe Nerves are diſtributed, are alſo ſtirred up or provoked into motions anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſame paſſion.</p>
                           <p>But the aforeſaid Prominences and their dependences ſerve no leſs alſo for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying of the impreſſions of natural Inſtincts to the Brain, that from thence the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and local motions might preſently be retorted: by which all the exigencies or wants perceived by the <hi>Praecordia</hi> or <hi>Viſcera</hi> might be ſupplied. When in a young one newly born the ſtomach crys out for hunger, the Inſtinct of this is carried by the paſſage of the Nerves to the Cerebel, and from thence by the medullar Proceſſes to theſe Protuberances; and the Spirits there inhabiting, form the Idea of the impreſſion, and carry it to the brain, wherein preſently, without any previous knowledge or experience, ſuch kind of conceptions of the Soul are ſtirred up, that every little living Creature preſently ſeeks out the Mothers breaſts and ſucks.</p>
                           <p>But it may be objected, it does not ſeem of neceſſity we ſhould ſuppoſe theſe kind of acts of the Paſſions and Inſtincts to be made apart in this by-place; for why are not the commerces of the animal Spirits ordained by the influence from the Brain into the Nerves leading to the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and ſo back again through the common paſſage of the oblong Marrow? But to that it may be readily anſwered, That this reciprocal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirits ought to be made through the middle region of the Cerebel, from one ſtage to another for the exerciſe of theſe Faculties: And therefore (ſince that all manner of communication between the Brain and Cerebel is performed by theſe Prominences) there ſhould alſo be had a paſſage by the ſame way between this and the Organs of the Functions merely natural. Beſides, if the rage or furious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Paſſions and Inſtincts ſhould be carried in the ſame path in which the forces of ſenſible things are carried, their acts might be greatly confounded by the mutual meeting or gathering together of the animal Spirits. But this kind of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis concerning the Acts and Progreſs of the Paſſions and natural Inſtincts, ſhall be made more clear afterwards, when we deſign the Actions and Uſes of the Cerebel, and of the other parts, which in like manner ſeem to be deſtinated to the ſame offices with theſe Protuberances.</p>
                           <p>In the mean time, what we have affirmed, that the latter Prominences are only Additionals or Excreſcences of the former, will clearly appear to any one beholding them. But this, as we have already hinted, is ſeen without Controverſie in the brains of a Calf, a Sheep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſome other four footed beaſts; where, when the <hi>Nates</hi> are ſignally great, the <hi>Teſtes</hi> grow to the ſame in a very ſmall bulk. Further, that the medullary Proceſſes lead from theſe into the Cerebel, and convey the animal Spirits by this by-path, is ſo manifeſt, that none who hath carefully beheld theſe parts, can be able any further to heſitate or be doubtful of it. For indeed the little hairs or fibres wherewith theſe proceſſes, aſcending into the Cerebel, are marked, are otherwiſe figured and placed than thoſe which are beheld in the neighbouring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs deſcending from the Cerebel towards the oblong Marrow.</p>
                           <p>Moreover, either pair of Prominences do not only communicate among themſelves mutually by their ſtretched out wings, but alſo another medullar Proceſs, going croſs-wiſe, knits together the aforeſaid Proceſſes ſtretched out from thence into the Cerebel; and from this joyning together of them two ſmall Nerves are produced, which bending down on either ſide, and being carried forward, enter the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and ſo go ſtraight through it, till having reached to the moving Nerves of the Eyes, they go forth of the Skull at the ſame hole with them, going forward ſtraight to the Trochlear Muſcle of the Eye. Concerning theſe little Nerves it is obſerved, that when many others proceed from the ſides or the Baſis of the oblong Marrow, theſe ariſe from the aforeſaid Prominences in the bunching forth at the top. The reaſon of which, if I be not miſtaken, is this: We have affirmed, that theſe Prominences do receive and communicate to the Brain the natural Inſtinct delivered from the Heart and Bowels to the Cerebel; and on the other ſide, or back again, do transfer towards the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> by the mediation of the Cerebel, the forces of the Paſſions or Affections received from the Brain; but in either action the motion of the Eyes is affected with a certain manifeſt Sympathy. For if pain, want, or any other ſignal trouble afflicts the <hi>Viſcera</hi> or the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> a dejected and caſt down aſpect of the Eyes will declare the ſenſe of its trouble: when on the contrary, in Joy, or any pleaſant Affection of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> or <hi>Viſcera,</hi> the Eyes are made lively and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:152521:162"/>
ſparkle again. In like manner, the Eyes do ſo clearly ſhew the Affections of the Mind, as Sadneſs, Anger, Hatred, Love, and other perturbations, that thoſe who are affected, though they ſhould diſſemble, cannot hide the feeling and intimate conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of the mind. Without doubt theſe ſo happen, becauſe the animal Spirits, tending this way and that way in this diverting place between the Brain and the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia,</hi> do at once ſtrike thoſe Nerves as the ſtrings of a Harp. Wherefore from this kind of conjecture which we have made concerning the uſe of theſe Nerves, we have called them Pathetical, although indeed other Nerves alſo may deſerve this name.</p>
                           <p>There yet remains for us to take notice of the aforeſaid Prominences, that either of theſe pairs, and the Proceſſes hanging on them, are diſtinguiſhed from the trunk of the oblong Marrow lying under by the Cavity between them; ſo that this Cavity or Ventricle ſeems to exiſt only ſecondarily, becauſe the empty ſpace between the aforeſaid bodies, placed above and beneath, ſeparating the ſame one from another, ought to come between. But this Cavity ſeeming to reſult ſo by accident, hath a very ſignal uſe; for in the middle of its paſſage a ſloping aperture reaches towards the Tunnel, through which the humors ſliding into either of its holes, one made more forward, the other more backward, are ſent out. The more forward hole is placed between the chambers of the Optick Nerves, a little before the pineal Glandula, into which the ſerous heap being laid up nigh to the confines of the oblong Marrow, ſlides by degrees: but the other hole is opened more backward into the fourth Ventricle which is planted under the Cerebel; which hole is covered with a thin Membrane, which girding about its mouth and that of the Cerebel, provides leſt the humors, derived from the fourth Ventricle, or the confines of the Cerebel, ſhould fall down any other way than into that hole; but if at any time that little hole be broken aſunder by a deluge of the Serum, the watry Latex ſliding down upon the Baſis of the oblong Marrow, overwhelms the origines of the Nerves, and ſo brings Convulſive diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and meltings, and not ſeldom deadly, of the vital Spirits, as I have obſerved in the bodies of many dying of Cephalick Diſeaſes.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the Uſes of the Cerebel, and of ſome of its Parts and Proceſſes.</head>
                           <p>HAving hitherto continued the former Tract of the oblong Marrow, which as it were the Kings High-way, leads from the Brain, as the Metropolis, into many Provinces of the nervous ſtock, by private receſſes and croſs-ways; it follows now that we view the other City of the animal Kingdom. The ſituation of this being remote enough from the former, its kind of ſtructure is alſo different from it: yea it ſeems that there are granted to this, as to a free and municipal City, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Priviledges and a peculiar Juriſdiction.</p>
                           <p>The Cerebel is placed a little below the orbicular Prominences in the hinder part of the Head; where growing to the trunk of the oblong Marrow by a double little foot, it appears almoſt of a Spherical figure. Its ſuperior gibboſity coheres towards the ſuperficies to the border of the Brain by the intervention of the <hi>Pia Mater;</hi> but nevertheleſs it is intimately united to it, nor is there any immediate commerce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this or that or their parts. There hath been ſpoken enough already of the figure and ſituation of the Cerebel, and of its various Proceſſes, and how it is faſtned to the oblong Marrow; it now remains that we proceed to deſign or draw out the offices and uſes of it, and its ſeveral parts. Where in the firſt place ſhall be inquired into, what kind of office the Cerebel is endued with in the animal oeconomy; then when we ſhall deſcend to particulars, there are more things worthy to be noted, which will offer themſelves to our conſideration: <hi>viz.</hi> firſt the infoldings of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels covering the whole compaſs of the Cerebel, and eſpecially its hinder part, with the heap of Kernels: ſecondly, its folds and lappets ordained with a certain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate ſeries, and almoſt after a like manner in all: thirdly, the double ſubſtance of the folds, <hi>viz.</hi> cortical and marrowy: and the concentring of all the medullary tracts in two large Marrows or middeſts: fourthly, either little foot or pedeſtal of the Cerebel made out of thoſe two middle Marrows: and in either pedeſtal three
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:152521:162"/>
diſtinct medullar Proceſſes to be found: fifthly, the annular Protuberance made by a proceſs of the Cerebel deſcending into the medullar Trunk: ſixthly, ſome Nerves, which ariſing immediately from this Protuberance and other Nerves in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, which being deſigned for the involuntary Function, receive the influences of the animal Spirits from the Cerebel: Laſtly, the Ventricle or Cavity lying under the Cerebel ought to be conſidered.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. As to the office or uſe of the Cerebel in general: nothing of it occurs, ſpoken by the Ancients, worthy its fabrick, or agreeable to its ſtructure. Some affirm this to be another Brain, and to perform the ſame actions with it: but if any one ſhould have a ſoft and fooliſh Brain, I greatly doubt, if he ſhould become wiſe, though he ſhould obtain perhaps a more hard and ſolid Cerebel. Others place the Memory in this part, ſuppoſing the Cerebel to be as it were a Cheſt or Box, wherein the Idea's or images of things, before laid up, are kept apart from the incourſe of freſh Species. But it is far more probable, that this faculty reſides in the cortical ſpires of the Brain, as we have elſewhere ſhewn. For as often as we endeavour to remember objects long ſince paſt, we rub the Temples and the fore-part of the Head, we erect the Brain, and ſtir up or awaken the Spirits dwelling in that place, as if endeavouring to find out ſomething lurking there; in the mean time, there is perceived nothing of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour or ſtriving motion in the hinder part of the Head. Beſides, we have ſhewn, that the Phantaſie and Imagination are performed in the Brain; but the Memory depends ſo upon the Imagination, that it ſeems to be only a reflected or inverſe act of this: wherefore that it ſhould be placed with it in the ſame Cloiſter, to wit, in the Brain, is but neceſſary; for it plainly appears, that there is no immediate commerce between the Brain and the Cerebel.</p>
                           <p>When ſome time paſt I diligently and ſeriouſly meditated on the office of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, and revolved in my mind ſeveral things concerning it, at length, from the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy and frequent Ratiocination, this (as I think) true and genuine uſe of it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred; to wit, that the Cerebel is a peculiar Fountain of animal Spirits deſigned for ſome works, and wholly diſtinct from the Brain. Within the Brain, Imagination, Memory, Diſcourſe, and other more ſuperior Acts of the animal Function are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; beſides, the animal Spirits flow alſo from it into the nervous ſtock; by which all the ſpontaneous motions, to wit, of which we are knowing and will, are performed. But the office of the Cerebel ſeems to be for the animal Spirits to ſupply ſome Nerves; by which involuntary actions (ſuch as are the beating of the Heart, eaſie Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the Concoction of the Aliment, the protruſion of the Chyle, and many others) which are made after a conſtant manner unknown to us, or whether we will or no, are performed. As often as we go about voluntary motion, we ſeem as it were to perceive within us the Spirits reſiding within the fore-part of the Head to be ſtirred up to action, or an influx. But the Spirits inhabiting the Cerebel perform unperceivedly and ſilently their works of Nature without our knowledge or care. Wherefore whilſt the Brain is garniſhed as it were with uncertain Meanders and crankling turnings and windings about, the compaſs of this is furniſhed with folds and lappets diſpoſed in an orderly ſeries; in the ſpaces of which, as in deſigned Orbs and Tracts, the animal Spirits are expanded according to the Rule and Method naturally impreſſed on them. For indeed thoſe in the Cerebel, as it were in a certain artificial Machine or Clock, ſeem orderly diſpoſed after that manner within certain little places and boundaries, that they may flow out orderly of their own accord one ſeries after another without any driver, which may govern or moderate their motions. Wherefore foraſmuch as ſome Nerves perform ſome kind of motions according to the inſtincts and wants of Nature, without conſulting the government of the will or appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite within the Brain, why may it not be imagined, that the influence of the Spirits is derived wholly from the Cerebel for the performing of theſe? For it ſeems inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that for theſe offices which ſhould be performed without any tumult or pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, the Spirits ſhould be called out of the Brain, which are continually driven into fluctuations as it were with the winds of Paſſions and Cogitations.</p>
                           <p>As I only imagined of the uſe of the Cerebel after this manner, I was led to it at length by a certain thread of Ratiocination; to which afterwards happened an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomical inſpection, which plainly confirmed me in this opinion. For in the frequent Diſſection of the Heads of ſeveral ſorts of Animals certain Obſervations did occur, which ſeemed to put this matter out of all doubt. For I firſt obſerved, the pairs of Nerves, which did ſerve to the Functions, wont to be performed by the Inſtinct of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:152521:163"/>
or the force of the Paſſions, rather than by the beck of the will, ſo immediately to depend on the Cerebel, that from thence only the influence of the animal Spirits ſeems to be derived into their origines or beginnings. By what means the Nerves ariſing from the Cerebel, or receiving from it the proviſion of the animal Spirits, do perform only involuntary actions, ſhall be declared hereafter; in the mean time, for the confirmation of this Opinion, we have in readineſs another Reaſon of no leſs moment.</p>
                           <p>Therefore ſecondly, we took notice, that not only the conformation or make of the Cerebel was ordained after a certain and peculiar manner, that is, that its frame or bulk was couched together with folds or little circles, diſpoſed in a certain diſtinct ſeries, and apt method, and proportionate within themſelves, as hath been ſaid; whence it may be argued, that the Spirits ariſing from hence, and flowing outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are imployed or beſtowed on ſome certain works determinate to one thing. But further it is obſerved, that in all Animals, although they differ in form and kind, yet the figure of the Cerebel is always very like or wholly the ſame. The Brain and oblong Marrow are figured in many after a divers manner; for as we have ſhewed before, there is ſome difference of theſe parts found in man and four-footed beaſts: but between either of theſe, and Fowls and Fiſhes, there is a notable difference as to theſe parts. Notwithſtanding in all theſe the Cerebel, furniſhed wholly with the ſame lappets or little circles alike infolded one in another, is marked with the ſame form and proportion; which certainly is a ſign that the animal Spirits in this work-houſe are begotten and diſpenſed, as it were by a certain dimenſion, for certain ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary offices, which are performed in all after the ſame manner; and which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any other than the motions and actions of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> and <hi>Praecordia.</hi> As to the other Faculties, of which ſort are Imagination, Memory, Appetite, yea local motions and ſenſe are exerciſed after one manner in thoſe living Creatures, and after another manner in others; wherefore their brains are formed after a divers manner. But the motions of the Heart and Reſpiration in all endued with an hot blood, are performed after a like manner, that is, with a perpetual viciſſititude of <hi>Syſtoles</hi> and <hi>Diaſtoles.</hi> Beſides, another office is to be aſſigned to the Cerebel, and different from what is convenient or agreeable to the Brain; becauſe where the folds and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are wanting in the Brain, they are conſtantly found in the Cerebel. Beſides theſe reaſons drawn from Anatomy, the Pathology of the humane Body affords many others, which confirm the aforeſaid office of the Cerebel. For it oftentimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that cruel and horrid Symptoms infeſt the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and the region of the middle or loweſt Belly; whilſt in the mean time, the morbifick cauſe lyes in the Cerebel or nigh its confines. I have known ſometimes men labouring only in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance with a Dyſcraſie of the hinder part of the Head, who complained of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Swooning and repeated meltings of the Spirits or Deliquiums, as if they were juſt dying: in whom notwithſtanding nothing more could be detected of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick cauſe or its ſeat, but that the Patient perceived a great heavineſs and pain in the hinder part of the Head, and that upon any ſudden motion or bending back of the Head, they were ready to dye. In truth, the Symptoms which are wont to be raiſed up in the diſtemper called the <hi>Incubus</hi> or Night-mare, <hi>viz.</hi> loſs of ſpeech, and a mighty weight or load that ſeems to lye upon the breaſt, proceed altogether from the morbifick matter fixed in the confines of the Cerebel, and obſtructing the paſſages of the Spirits deſtinated for the <hi>Praecordia.</hi> But indeed this Hypotheſis of the office of the Cerebel ſhall be more illuſtrated and confirmed from the uſes of its ſeveral parts, being rightly deſigned or drawn forth.</p>
                           <p>As to the parts and accidents of the Cerebel, 1. we take notice, that the infold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Veſſels every where cloath the Cerebel no leſs than the Brain, alſo that the ridges and furrows of its folds intimately hide or cover it, which certainly is a ſign that the animal Spirits are begotten in this other work-houſe of them from the watering blood, and inſtilled into its ſubſtance: which thing alſo more clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, becauſe the Arteries and Veins are not only variouſly complicated in the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Cerebel, but both of them in like manner as in the Brain, ſend forth frequent ſhoots into its more inward ſubſtance; wherefore whilſt the moſt ſubtil and ſpirituous part of the blood being carried through long windings about, and as it were ſerpentine chanels of the Veſſels, and ſo ſublimed into Spirits is received within; the bloody part is carried away by the ſhoots of the Veins ſent alſo deeply down. Further, even as the more watry portion of the blood, deſtinated for the Brain, runs
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:152521:163"/>
into the <hi>Choroeidal</hi> infolding; (whereby it may there lay aſide its unprofitable Phlegm into the Glandula's) ſo for the ſake of ſeparating the Phlegm an heap of Glandula's, with the foldings of the Veſſels, as it were a Receptacle fitted for this buſineſs, is placed in the hinder region of the Cerebel.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. From the blood, after this manner cleared from Phlegm, and made ſubtil by a long circulation, a very pure and ſpirituous liquor is inſtilled into the cortical ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Cerebel, which is preſently exalted by the Ferment there placed into animal Spirits. For indeed we have affirmed, that the Spirits are procreated only in the cortical part of the Cerebel, as in that of the Brain: wherefore, becauſe this kind of Cortex is wanting to the oblong and ſpinal Marrow, we think theſe parts do ſerve only for the exerciſe of the animal Spirits, and not for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Spirits every where produced within the cortical or exterior compaſs of the Cerebel, in which they are preſently prepared for the work of the animal Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, are derived from all the folds into the medullar tract, and thence into two ample middle Marrows; where they keep full as it were the fountain or ſpring, and there like the bubling up of waters, are circulated within with a perpetual turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and from thence they continually ſtream forth into the parts of the nervous Syſtem proper to themſelves.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. As to the ways of Emanation it is obſerved, that the two middle Marrows of the Cerebel paſs as it were into two pedeſtals or little feet, by which they are faſtned to the trunk of the oblong Marrow; and for that in either little foot of it three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct medullar Proceſſes are found, all theſe, or at leaſt two of them, are as it were ſo many paths whereby the animal Spirits ſtream forth from their fountain and flow back again.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. The firſt of theſe Proceſſes aſcends into the Cerebel from the orbicular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minences: the uſe of this we have already declared; to wit, that there may be a certain paſſage between theſe Prominences and the Cerebel, in which, whilſt the animal Spirits, as in a by-path, move this way and that way, to and fro, they may tranſmit both the force of the Paſſions from the Brain by the interpoſition of the Cerebel to the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and convey alſo the natural Inſtincts delivered to the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebel from the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera</hi> towards the Brain. But the ſecond Proceſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending ſtraight from the Cerebel, embraces the medullar Trunk, and ſo going round about it, conſtitutes the annular or ringy Protuberance, out of which the fifth, ſixth, and ſeventh pair of Nerves take their originals; ſo indeed, that this Protuberance ſeems to be the Ware-houſe or Store-houſe of the Spirits flowing from the Cerebel, from which they may influence and be derived into the oppoſite paſſages of the Nerves. Laſtly, the third proceſs of either little foot, deſcending from the Cerebel into the oblong Marrow, is inſerted into its trunk over againſt where the eighth pair of Nerves have their original; ſo that it ſhould ſeem very likely, the proviſion of the Spirits deſtinated for this Nerve is derived alſo by this way from the Cerebel; then what Spirits ſuperabound, remaining longer than this Nerve requires, they ſliding down into the common belly or chanel of the oblong and ſpinal Marrow, increaſe the plenty of thoſe parts. For this ſame end the ſmooth and pyramidal bodies are reached out of the annular Protuberance above the oblong Marrow towards the Spine, to wit, that by the paſſage of thoſe Proceſſes the Spirits of that proviſion or ſtock ſuperabounding, might flow out partly into the beginning of the eighth pair, and partly into the common tract of the medullar Trunk.</p>
                           <p>Thus much we have ſpoken briefly and ſummarily of the Uſes of the Cerebel, and of its parts and Proceſſes. But that it may be the better underſtood, and alſo that this new thought of Theory concerning the involuntary Function of the animal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, may be more clearly illuſtrated, we ſhall here give you a more particular Order or Method of the Spirits brought forth in the Cerebel, and as it were take a view of, or muſter their Arms or Forces. Further, it will ſeem to the purpoſe, that we ſhould deſign or draw forth more openly the abundance or plenty of the Nerves receiving their gifts from this Fountain of the Spirits concerning the Acts to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed only of the involuntary Function.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of the various Order and diverſe manner of Exerciſe of the Spirits produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Cerebel for the Acts of the involuntary Function.</head>
                           <p>AFter having ſhewn, that the office of the Cerebel is to procreate animal Spirits apart from the Spirits begotten in the Brain, and to diſpenſe them into the Nerves, the Executors of the involuntary Actions and Paſſions; there yet remains to be unfolded by what manner of oeconomy or government the Spirits inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting the Cerebel and made free, are buſied both by an inteſtine Circulation, within their proper dwelling places, and alſo are wont to be expanded and flow out with an exterior irradiation for the neceſſities and wants of other parts: then theſe things being ſhewn, we ſhall deſign more particularly the Uſes and Offices of the Nerves, and of ſome other Proceſſes doing ſervice to this Government.</p>
                           <p>As to the firſt, as the Cerebel is the other primary Root of the ſenſitive Soul, or the Fountain from whence the animal Spirits, being diffuſed through the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it and its Appendix, are continued ſtill under the ſame Syſtaſis and radiant Contexture, it is to be noted, that this radiation of the Spirits from the Cerebel doth flow after another manner than the other from the Brain: becauſe this being left to it ſelf, is beſtowed by a conſtant efflux or flowing out on the Organs both of the vital Function and the merely natural, and its expences by an equal continual proviſion of Spirits, are made up again from the bloody maſs continually inſtilled in. But on the contrary, the Spirits flow out from the Brain, neither by ſuch a continual courſe without intermiſſion and by little and little, nor are ſuſtained by a perpetual proviſion and ſliding in by degrees; but both the loſs of them, and their refection, are uncertain, unequal, and variouſly interrupted. For neither are the ſpontaneous Acts of the Function it ſelf, to which they ſerve, performed after any conſtant or always the ſame manner; but according to exterior accidents and occaſions we put them forth by heaps, and with a certain force ſometimes, and again ſometimes we ſuffer them to be wholly intermitted and unimployed. Therefore the Spirits alſo are in like manner ſupplied with an uncertain meaſure; to wit, they are inſtilled in ſleep plentifully and more copiouſly, but waking more ſparingly and with hard labour, or ſcarce not at all. Yea the involuntary portion it ſelf of the ſenſitive Soul (which flows from the Cerebel) for that it hath a near commerce and affinity (as was already ſaid) with the other radicated in the Brain, therefore it is wont to be much diſturbed in the performing its office equally and peaceably, and being variouſly affected and agitated by the impulſes ſent here and there, or from this place and that, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, ſometimes to contract, ſometimes to extend its <hi>Syſtaſis</hi> in the whole or in part, and ſo is rendred obnoxious to ſeveral Paſſions, and ordinarily inſtigated to the performing irregular and diſorderly actions.</p>
                           <p>But indeed the contexture of the Spirits, or the part of the Soul irradiating the Cerebel and its Appendix, is both affected with a certain ſenſe, and is urged into motions appropriate to it ſelf, though divers. The ſenſe or Sympathy belonging to this, if it be terminated within the confines of the Cerebel, is always private, nor goes any farther forward to the Brain with a more ſtrong undulation or wavering; and becauſe it is performed the living Creature knowing nothing of it, unleſs by the effect it cannot be known, for that it excites a peculiar motion. But ſuch an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Cerebel is implanted in it, that by every new diſpoſition of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera</hi> communicated to this from beneath, alſo from every violent paſſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited within the <hi>Forum</hi> of the Brain, and ſo ſent from above, a certain impreſſion is carried to the inhabitants of the Cerebel: by which indeed they are diſpoſed into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ordinations for the performing theſe or thoſe motions reſpectively.</p>
                           <p>For examples ſake, ſo long as the tranquil region of the Cerebel, like a ſerene and fair Heaven, is free from all perturbation, the Spirits its inhabitants, being poured out with a pleaſing ſenſe, or as it were a certain complacency, flow within their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per habitations, both with a gentle circulation, and alſo with an equal flowing out enter the beginnings of the Nerves ſerving to the Functions both vital and natural: by which indeed eaſie Reſpiration, the Pulſe, Chylification, and other offices of the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:152521:164"/>
ſame nature, are performed peaceably. But if that any trouble or moleſtation hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen outwardly to any one, from whence an impreſſion of it is communicated to the Cerebel, preſently a troubleſom ſenſe being ſtirred up there, it diſturbs the animal Spirits in the Fountain it ſelf, and ſo is wont to excite irregular motions in the Organs of the involuntary Function. For from hence the frequent alteration of the Pulſe and of Reſpiration, alſo Cramps of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and convulſive motions ariſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us, or alſo againſt our wills. But an impreſſion ſent from elſewhere to the Cerebel, and inducing the ſame kind of troubleſom ſenſe, either aſcends by the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Nerves from the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> or it is carried from above from the Brain by the paſſage of the orbicular Prominences; as ſhall be ſhewn more largely anon.</p>
                           <p>In the mean time, from theſe things already ſhewed of the paſſive power or ſenſe of the Cerebel, it may be eaſily collected, by what means, with what order and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the animal Spirits, ariſing from the ſame, are moved. But firſt you muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between their twofold motion. For one is cuſtomary and ordinary, conſiſting in a perpetual and equal efflux of Spirits; by which indeed, they flowing into the beginnings of the Nerves nigh their riſings, eſpecially of the intercoſtal and wandring pair, the ſolemn acts of the Pulſe, Reſpiration, Chylification, and others of the involuntary Function are performed. Then ſecondly, the other motion happens extraordinary and occaſional, which the ſame Spirits perform confuſedly, as it were in diſturbed orders: as when the Pulſe becomes quicker or ſlower than it ought, or the Reſpiration unequal or interrupted; and when the other Faculties, which belong to this Claſs, are perverted from their regular and conſtant manner. But theſe kind of extraordinary motions are again twofold, to wit, for that its inſtigation proceeds from a double bound; for the impulſe whereby the Spirits inhabiting the Cerebel, are compelled into an irregular action, (as we have but now intimated) is carried either from beneath, <hi>viz.</hi> from the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera;</hi> or it is wont to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from above, to wit, from the Brain.</p>
                           <p>As to the firſt, if at any time the <hi>Praecordia</hi> grow too hot, and are burnt with a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh heat, preſently by the paſſage of the Intercoſtals and the wandring pair of Nerves, the Spirits reſiding in the Cerebel, being warned of this evil, inſtitute more frequent and ſtronger acts both of the Pulſe and of Reſpiration. In like manner, if by chance the humors and ſharp Juyces irritate or greatly trouble or afflict the Coats of the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles or Inteſtines through the ſenſe of this affection communicated to the Cerebel, the inſtinct of performing the motion is reciprocated, whereby the fibres of the parts, being contracted and wrinkled together, endeavour the ſhaking off of the hurtful matter. More inſtances might be here brought of all the other acts of the vital or merely natural Function: of which beſides it may be obſerved, that when a ſenſe of the trouble is immediately conveyed from the <hi>Praecordia</hi> or <hi>Viſcera</hi> to the Cerebel, this affection, like the waving of waters, is either ſtopt or terminated there, from whence a motion, as the buſineſs requires, unknown to the Brain, is preſently retorted, as when the actions of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> are altered by a feaveriſh diſtemper without our knowledge; or ſecondly, that ſenſe of the trouble being tranſmitted to the Cerebel, for that it is more vehement, it unfolds it ſelf more largely, and like a ſtronger wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of waters, paſſing through the Cerebel, goes forward further even to the Brain, and warns its inhabitants of the evil; by which they being incited to oppoſe the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, cauſe a motion of another kind: So (as hath been ſaid) when the <hi>Praecordia</hi> grow cruelly hot, the Cerebel feeling this, makes the Pulſe and Reſpiration ſtronger. But further, the Brain being warned of the ſame trouble, ſeeks and diligently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires cold drink and other remedies to moderate the heat. Moreover, it is after this manner alſo in ſeveral other actions, which though they are regular, yet being made in the Brain without any previous knowledge, they are ſaid to be done by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts merely natural; as when brute Animals, being newly brought forth, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſeek for the Dams teats, and greedily ſuck; or Birds, without any ſhewing or example, build neſts with wonderful Art, lay eggs, and hatch young ones. In theſe kind of works the Brain being taught before by none, directs fit means to the ends inſtituted by Nature: which indeed ſeems to be done by this means. The ſenſe of every neceſſity being brought to the Cerebel, incites the Spirits inhabiting it to ſuccour it; which when they are not able to do, the impreſſion going from thence further forward, is carried to the orbicular Prominences: by which the Spirits there inhabiting, being preſently ſtruck, form the Appetite or the intention of performing,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:152521:165"/>
which being thence communicated to the Brain, it readily cauſes that local motions, fit for the executing of the work, be retorted. Of theſe we ſhall ſpeak anon a little more largely, when we treat of the reſpect which happens between the orbicular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minences and the annular Protuberance.</p>
                           <p>In the mean time, we ſhall take notice in the ſecond place, that the irregular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirits inhabiting the Cerebel, are wont alſo, by reaſon of the force of the affections, to be tranſmitted from thence to the Brain: for as often as a violent paſſion, as Joy, Sadneſs, Anger, Fear, or of any other kind, is conceived in the Brain, preſently the impreſſion of the ſame being brought through the by-paths of the Prominences into the Cerebel, diſturbs the Spirits deſtinated to the vital or mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly natural Function in their very fountain, and for that reaſon preſently induces no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table mutations in the Organs of thoſe Functions.</p>
                           <p>What hath been ſpoken hitherto of the Cerebel being imployed about the offices of the involuntary Function only, alſo concerning the ſenſe and the motions both uſual and irregular of the Spirits inhabiting it, will be made more clear, if laſtly we ſhall ſhew the offices of the Nerves and of the other proceſſes, immediately depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Cerebel, to be no other than ſuch as perform only involuntary Acts: which ſhall be briefly and ſuccinctly done, as far as is pertinent to our purpoſe, becauſe a more full conſideration of them is left to another place.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Of the Nerves, which receiving the ſtores or companies of the Spirits from the Cerebel, beſtow them on the Acts of the involuntary Function.</head>
                           <p>WE have already ſhewed, that out of the annular Protuberance (which is a certain Proceſs of the Cerebel) three pairs of Nerves, to wit, the fifth, ſixth, and ſeventh immediately ariſe. We have ſaid that Protuberance to be as it were a Repoſitory or Store-houſe, wherein the Spirits flowing out of the Cerebel, and to be derived into the depending Nerves, as occaſion ſerves, are kept: and in the mean time, whilſt they remain there, they who ſtream out from either middle Marrow of the Cerebel diviſively, meeting mutually in this Cirque, are united together. But as the aforeſaid three pairs of Nerves receive the forces of the Spirits from the Cerebel by the mediation of that Protuberance; ſo alſo the eighth pair ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its riſe near the inſertion of the other (<hi>viz.</hi> the loweſt) medullar Proceſs ſent down from the Brain, ſeems to derive by its paſſage the influence of the Spirits no leſs from the Cerebel: wherefore when theſe four conjugations of Nerves owe the Tribute of their Spirits wholly to the Cerebel, if I ſhall ſhew that all theſe Nerves ſerve chiefly and almoſt only to the involuntary acts of the Senſes and Motions, ſurely this will be a ſignal Argument, that according to our Hypotheſis, the office of the Cerebel is to beget and to diſpenſe the animal Spirits requiſite for the involuntary Functions.</p>
                           <p>Therefore in the firſt place we obſerve of the fifth and ſixth conjugation of Nerves, that as this ariſes out of the Baſis of the greater Ring, and that from its ſides both in man and in four-footed beaſts; the fifth pair being carried more forward, diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes its branches into the Glandula's of the Eyes, into the Noſtrils, into the Palate, Teeth, yea and into moſt parts of the Face and Mouth; but the ſixth pair is wholly beſtowed on ſome Muſcles of the Eyes. Further, out of the trunk of the fifth pair two ſhoots, and another out of the Nerve of the ſixth pair bending back behind, meet together; and what is wonderful, and not before taken notice of by Anatomiſts, the intercoſtal Nerves, deſtinated to the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> do make a Trunk; ſo that the Nerves of the fifth and ſixth pair ſtretch out a double Ramification, to wit, one more above about the parts of the Mouth and Face, and the other lower through the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the middle and loweſt Belly. But it will appear clearly to any one conſidering this thing more carefully, that the chief branches of either partition are imployed about the involuntary offices of Motion and Senſe, of which ſort thoſe are chiefly, that either cauſe the paſſions, or perform the natural Inſtincts.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Concerning the intercoſtal Nerve, which (as was ſaid) being radicated in the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:152521:165"/>
Nerves of the fifth and ſixth pair, depends as to its origine wholly on the Cerebel, it is not here to be doubted but that it looking towards the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera</hi> in a man, and towards theſe latter only in moſt four-footed beaſts, is beſtowed on the Functions only vital and merely natural, and ſo confers little or nothing to ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous actions. Further, foraſmuch as this Nerve reaching forth into the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the whole Abdomen, is continued by its ſuperior ramification alſo into the Eyes, as alſo into the parts of the Mouth and Face; certainly from hence a true and genuine reaſon may be given wherefore in every paſſion the Eyes, Face, and Mouth do ſo correſpond with the affections of the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> often unknown to us or againſt our minds, that oftentimes we are compelled to betray the moſt intimate ſenſe of the Heart by the countenance and aſpect. Yea, hence a reaſon may be brought, why in ſneeſing, yawning, laughing, and crying the Muſcles of the Face conſpire ſo in motion with the <hi>Praecordia.</hi> Beſides, when in man different from any other living Creatures beſides, as we ſhall ſhew afterwards, many ſhoots are ſent from the intercoſtal Nerve to the Nerve of the Diaphragma; this certainly is the cauſe why riſibility is the proper affection of man.</p>
                           <p>But the Trunk of the fifth pair being carried more forward, and diſtributing its branchings through the parts of the whole Face, cauſes the ſame not only to be pathetically moved, and figured according to the affections of the <hi>Praecordia;</hi> but alſo produces ſome acts, both of motion and ſenſation, of another kind, which for the moſt part are involuntary, and ſo ſeem to depend wholly upon the Cerebel im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. For example, this Nerve imparts ſhoots to either mandible requiſite for the buſineſs of chewing: but it is very well known, that the taking in of the food at the mouth is the firſt and oldeſt buſineſs of every Animal, which indeed is taught by natural Inſtinct before any knowledge of the Brain. But as to the Senſes, the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this pair conduce ſomething to the ſmelling, but for the moſt part for the knowing and chuſing of ſavors. Hence it comes to paſs, that as odors refreſh the Brain by the ſmelling Nerves, ſo alſo they affect the Cerebel by the branch of this pair, and are wont by that means to recreate the <hi>Viſcera</hi> and <hi>Praecordia.</hi> But ſapors or taſtes (for that they are almoſt the peculiar Province of this) carry whatſoever they have of pleaſantneſs or trouble, firſt to the Spirits inhabiting the Cerebel, and then by their conſent to the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera.</hi> Hence it is, that a Pectoral not only allays hunger, but the very firſt taſting of Wine raiſes up thoſe that are fainting or ſwooning away. Moreover, foraſmuch as from this Nerve certain branches ſerve for the taſte, and others for the ſmell, there is contracted ſo ſtrict an affinity between either of theſe Senſories, that nothing pleaſes the taſte unleſs it be approved of by the ſmell: and the loſs of one of theſe ſenſes oftentimes cauſes the privation or the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the other.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Concerning the Nerve of the ſixth conjugation we obſerve, that as one ſhoot is bent back for a root of the intercoſtal Nerve, the remaining Trunk of it being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried forward towards the ball of the Eye, is diſtributed to two of its Muſcles, <hi>viz.</hi> to the ſeventh, proper to beaſts, and to the drawing Muſcle. Hence may be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that this Nerve, beſides the influence of it beſtowed on the vital and natural Function, ſerves alſo for the producing ſome pathetick motions of the Eye, to wit, ſuch as are wont to obey the affections of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera;</hi> ſo that the whole proviſion of the animal Spirit, which it receives from the Cerebel, it beſtows only on involuntary acts.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The ſeventh pair, or the hearing Nerves, ſeem alſo to depend upon the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, foraſmuch as they take their originals out of the annular Protuberance: but the uſe of them is a little otherwiſe in man than in four-footed beaſts. For in him the annular Protuberance is one, and that very big, from whoſe lower margin the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Nerves proceed: but in Brutes the Protuberance is twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> one greater, ſent down from the Cerebel, in which the beginnings of the fifth and ſixth pair of Nerves conſiſt; then near this there is another leſſer, and as it were ſecondary, from which the auditory Nerves proceed. This leſſer and lower Ring doth not ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly depend on the Cerebel, as the former; but there is ſtretched out from either height of it a white medullar line upon the oblong Marrow in the bottom of the fourth Ventricle: ſo as this ſeems to receive either the Spirits from the oblong Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or at leaſt to carry into the ſame the ſenſible Species: for what uſe it is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted ſhall be inquired into afterwards; for concerning theſe Nerves of the ſeventh pair, foraſmuch as ſome offices of them very much illuſtrate the government or oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:152521:166"/>
of the Cerebel, we ſhall diſcourſe here a little more largely.</p>
                           <p>Therefore in man, who hath got a great and undivided annular Protuberance, the auditory Nerves coming out of its margin or brim, ſhew its ſtock received of the Cerebel: by which means we may ſee the tasks of thoſe Nerves quadrate with the aſſigned government of this. We have ſhewn before the Proceſſes (which in a manner may be called diſtinct Nerves) of the ſeventh pair to be twofold on either ſide: one, the ſofter of theſe, ſerves only for the ſenſe, but the other harder ſeems to perform ſome motions. This latter Nerve, being carried without the Skull, is divided into three branches, all which ſerve to pathetick motions, or at leaſt to ſuch as are performed without conſulting the Brain.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The firſt of them being bent back towards the auditory paſſage, is beſtowed on the Muſcles of the Ear. Without doubt, by the action of this, it is effected, that all Animals at the ſudden impulſe of a ſound or noiſe, erect their Ears at it were to catch the ſound too ſoon paſſing by. 2. The other branch of this ſame Nerve climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Muſcles of the Jaw, ſends forth ſhoots towards either corner of the Eye: which are inſerted into the Muſcles lifting up the Eye-lids; the office of which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to open ſuddenly the Eyes at the ſudden approach of any ſound, and as it were to call them forth to watch, that by the ſtroke of the Air being brought to the Ear, the Eye might preſently look about to ſee what is the matter, and whether there might be any danger near or not: which alſo all Creatures do unthought of. 3. The third branch of the ſame auditory Nerve deſcending towards the root of the Tongue, is diſtributed to its Muſcles, and to thoſe of the Bone <hi>Hyoides,</hi> and ſo actuates ſome of the Organs for the framing the Voice. For this reaſon in ſome meaſure it comes to paſs, that living Creatures being aſtoniſhed at an unaccuſtomed or horrid ſound, preſently putting forth an uncertain voice, cry out and make a noiſe. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of theſe kind of Nerves in man ſerves for another more noted uſe, to wit, that the voice might fitly anſwer to the hearing, and that this might be ſet as the Echo of the ſound admitted by this: ſo indeed, as on the other ſide, there be two Nerves of the ſame pair, the ſound is received by the hearing through one, which is rendred again by the voice through the other. The common and extrinſick Echo conſiſts in this, that a certain undulation or waving of the Air ſhaken or moved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtirred up, and tending towards or about, when by reaſon of ſome ſtop or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance, it cannot go any further directly, being preſently repercuſſed or ſtruck back or reflected at certain angles, it is terminated contrary to the former bound. In like manner, in the hearing, the impreſſion of the ſound, or the Species admitted to the Ears by the hearing faculty of the Proceſſes of the ſame or neighbouring Nerve, and being carried inwardly towards the Cerebel and common Senſory; and from thence again reflected on the vocal proceſs, it is carried out by the Mouth. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe there is ſome difference, to wit, foraſmuch as the outward Echo renders back the ſound immediately; but the ſound of the Hearing is not neceſſarily carried forth at the mouth preſently, but that this leaves an Idea in the Head, according to which afterwards, as occaſion ſerves, the voice is formed, which bears the type and image of that, though ſome time before admitted.</p>
                           <p>But here (if I may digreſs a little) we ſhould inquire in what part of the Head the Ideas of ſounds are left: whether only in the Brain, which is the Cheſt of Memory acquired as it were artificial; or whether not alſo in the Cerebel, which is the place of natural memory? Truly we ſuppoſe, that ſounds belong to both theſe, as it were to diſtinct Store-houſes. Every audible impulſe being ſtruck againſt the Ear, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently carried by the paſſage of the auditory Proceſs to the annulary Protuberance; but from thence it is carried, as other ſenſible Species, to the chamfered bodies or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſory; (which way it paſſes thither, ſhall be ſhewed afterwards) this impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion tending from thence farther, and being alſo delivered to the Brain, ſtirs up the Imagination, and ſo leaves in its Cortex an image or private mark of it ſelf for the Memory. Further alſo, as the auditory Proceſs depends on the Cerebel, and receives from it the proviſion of the animal Spirits: ſo it is moſt likely, that by the receſs of the ſame Spirits the Ideas of the Sounds are conveyed alſo to the Cerebel; which forming there footſteps or tracts, impreſs a remembrance of themſelves, from whence when afterwards the Species there laid up are drawn forth by the help of the vocal proceſs, voices, like the ſounds before admitted, and breaking forth in a certain ordained ſeries, come to be made.</p>
                           <p>Hence it is uſual, that muſick or melody is ſoon learnt by ſome men, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:152521:166"/>
they bring forth with exact Symphony, without any meditation or labour of the Brain; to wit, from the diſtinct accents of the heard harmony, the Spirits moving within the Cerebel are diſpoſed into peculiar Schemes; according to which, when they flow on both ſides into the vocal proceſs of the auditory Nerve, they render as it were with a certain ſpontaneous voice, and like a Machine or Clock with the ſucceſſion of Species, the meaſures or Tunes of the Inſtrument which they had drunk in at the ears. Without doubt hence the reaſon may be ſought, why ſome men learn Muſick without any trouble, and others hardly or not at all. For it is obſerved, that ſome Children, before they can ſpeak diſtinctly, quickly ſing, and remember certain Tunes; whilſt others, though very ingenious men and of excellent memory, are very Fools at Muſick, and become uncapable, as an Aſs for the Harp; wherefore 'tis commonly ſaid, that ſome have muſical ears, and others are wholly deſtitute of that faculty. In the mean time, 'tis to be confeſſed, that in theſe the Organs of the Voice are not defective; but all the fault, though wrongfully, is caſt on the hearing.</p>
                           <p>But in truth the genuine cauſe of this defect ſeems to conſiſt in this, that when in all, the audible Species go to the Cerebel ſooner and more immediately than the Brain; yet in ſome the Cerebel being harder, and not eaſily yielding to the received impreſſions, thoſe Species, becauſe they could impreſs nothing of themſelves in their paſſing to the Cerebel, being carried towards the common Senſory, leave their Types or Ideas chiefly and almoſt wholly in the Brain: which part being ſtill buſied with diſturbed motions, is leſs apt to keep diſtinctly the compoſures of Harmony. But in the mean time, in others the Species of audible things, beſides that they are carried to the common Senſory and to the Brain, do alſo affect the Cerebel, eſpecially if they are harmonically figured (foraſmuch as in them there is a ſofter capacity of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions) with a peculiar order and Scheme of the animal Spirits: where, as the Species of the Harmony being diſpoſed in convenient little places and cells are kept, afterwards they flow out from thence, almoſt unthought of, without any endeavour or labour of remembrance, but in a diſtinct ſeries, and as it were in compoſed modes and figures, and ſo by blowing up the vocal proceſſes, they conſtitute ſweet Tunes and vocal Muſick.</p>
                           <p>If that the divers ways of paſſage are inquired into, to wit, whereby the audible Species, being carried into the annular Protuberance, do get both to the Brain and Cerebel; I ſay it is not improbable, but out of that Protuberance both a paſſage lyes open into the underlying tract of the oblong Marrow, and as it were the high road; as alſo another paſſage is opened into the Cerebel through the medullar proceſſes of the ſame Ring. But leſt there ſhould perchance be a confuſion of the animal Spirits and the ſenſible Species, (which indeed can hardly be avoided) if the way made for their paſſage ſhould lye open into various paſſages and manifold apertures; therefore concerning this it may well be ſuppoſed, that the Ideas of the Sounds paſs through the Cerebel, when they are carried to the common Senſory; which region being firſt paſt, they are at length brought by a by-path, <hi>viz.</hi> through the orbicular Prominences to the chamfered Bodies: which perhaps is partly the reaſon, that in the Hearing the perception of the ſenſe ſucceeds ſo late, and the impulſe of the object, in reſpect of ſight, follows ſo ſlowly.</p>
                           <p>Whilſt therefore the audible Species paſſes through the Cerebel, in ſome men, it leaves in this region (for that it is of a ſoft temper, and fit for the receiving im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions) tracts and marks of it ſelf, and ſo they obtain muſical ears. But in others who have a harder frame of the Cerebel, they produce no tracts of the ſame Sounds, and therefore ſuch are wholly deſtitute of the faculty of Muſick.</p>
                           <p>As therefore we ſuppoſe the audible Species to paſs through the Cerebel after this manner, a reaſon may be given from hence, wherefore Muſick does not only affect the Phantaſie with a certain delight, but beſides chears a ſad and ſorrowful Heart; yea, allays all turbulent Paſſions excited in the Breaſt from an immoderate heat and fluctuation of the blood. For ſince the animal Spirits, ſerving for the motion of the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> are derived from the Cerebel; as the perturbations conceived in the Brain, the influence being tranſmitted hither by moving theſe Spirits in the Fountain it ſelf, transfer the force of their Affections on the Breaſt; ſo the Melody introduced to the Ears, and diffuſed through this Province, does as it were inchant with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle breath the Spirits there inhabiting, and compoſes them, called off from their fury, to numbers and meaſures of dancing, and ſo appeaſes all tumults and inordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therein excited.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="120" facs="tcp:152521:167"/>From theſe may in ſome meaſure be known the reaſon of the difference, why the hearing Nerves are after a different manner in man and in four-footed beaſts: for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in theſe there is little need that the audible Species ſhould paſs through the Cerebel, either for the reciprocations of the ſound heard, by the voice, or for the impreſſing there the Tunes of the Harmony (for neither is Muſick required, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Poets feign, to the taming the Affections which move the breaſts of beaſts) therefore in theſe (I mean in four-footed beaſts) the annular Protuberance diſpenſing the animal Spirits to the auditory Nerves, and receiving from them the ſenſible Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, requires not ſo ſtrict an affinity with the Cerebel: yea, whenas it may ſuffice, that thoſe Nerves ariſe from the oblong Marrow, yet the annular Protuberance, as it were a common Porch, ought to be prefixed to them; to wit, in which both the Spirits going out from either ſide, and the ſenſible Species to be carried to either, ought firſt to be mixed and united together, leſt otherwiſe every ſound ſhould become double.</p>
                           <p>Among the Nerves which are ſeen to belong to the Cerebel, and to perform its offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, laſtly follow the eighth or wandring pair, which indeed hath its riſe out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Trunk of the oblong Marrow, near the place where the laſt proceſs of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebel is terminated, and over againſt where the pyramidal bodies, being produced from the annular Protuberance, end: ſo that we think theſe Nerves alſo, by that proceſs coming between on either ſide, and alſo perhaps in ſome meaſure through the paſſage of the pyramidal bodies, do derive all manner of influence of the animal Spirit from the Cerebel.</p>
                           <p>The beginning of theſe conſiſts of very many fibres and filaments or little threads preſently diſtinct one from another; to which belongs, from the very beginning of every Nerve, a noted Trunk ariſing out of the ſpinal Marrow. The deſcription of the wandring pair of Nerves, and its protenſion into the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and ſome <hi>Viſcera,</hi> are added hereafter. For the preſent it ſhall ſuffice, that we take notice, that for as much as this Nerve is beſtowed chiefly on the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> the acts whereof are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary, and are performed without our care or knowledge in ſleep as well as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; and for that the ſame Nerve ſeems to receive the forces of the Spirits wholly from the nearer fountain of the Cerebel; from hence it may certainly be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the government or oeconomy of the Cerebel regards only the involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Function.</p>
                           <p>So much for the Nerves, which being ſubjected to the Government and Laws of the Cerebel, ſeem to obey and ſerve under it: among which moreover ought to be placed the fourth pair, or the pathetick Nerves of the Eyes, to wit, which ariſing out of the firſt proceſſes of the Cerebel, come between that and the orbicular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes; of the uſe of which we have ſpoken already. Further, we ſhall here take notice, that ſome other Nerves to be deſcribed below, for that they communicate with the aforeſaid Nerves near their originals, cauſe alſo ſome involuntary acts to be performed; of which ſort are firſt the ninth pair, the ſpinal Nerve acceſſory to the wandring pair, alſo the Nerve of the Diaphragma, and ſome others, as we ſhall ſhew more at large in the particular Hiſtory of the Nerves.</p>
                           <p>We may alſo obſerve, concerning the Nerves but now deſcribed, which owe their ſtock to the Cerebel, and ſeem to be deſigned for the offices of the involuntary Function, that ſometimes ſome of them, though of another Dominion, are compelled to obey the beck and government of the Brain: for we are wont to draw the parts of the Face, uſually moved pathetically and unthought of, and alſo at our pleaſure, into theſe or thoſe Configurations or poſtures: we are able alſo in a meaſure to alter the motions and actions of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera</hi> at the will or command of the Appetite. The reaſon of theſe is, partly becauſe the Nerves of either Government communicate variouſly among themſelves with ſhoots ſent forth one to another, ſo that oftentimes the offices of the one are drawn into the parts of the other. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we have mentioned before, that the ſenſible impreſſion being inflicted on the parts of the involuntary Function, foraſmuch as it is vehement, like a ſtrong waving of water, paſſing through the Cerebel, affects the Brain it ſelf. In like manner it may be thought concerning the motion which belongs to thoſe parts, <hi>viz.</hi> that made after the ordinary manner, that it is performed by the command of the Cerebel. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſome more ſevere Edicts of the Brain, by the by-paſſage of the Prominen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, belong alſo to the Cerebel, and determine the Offices of the Inhabitants of it to be performed at the beck of the Appetite. As every one ſees that violent Paſſions
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:152521:167"/>
(whether the will be privy or not) eaſily do this; why therefore may not the will it ſelf alſo, as occaſion requires, exerciſe the ſame dominion? But in the mean time, this derogates nothing from the priviledges of the Cerebel, that it may not be called a free and municipal City, and ſo Miſtreſs of the involuntary Function; for that in ſome few it is after the manner of the Brain: becauſe the Brain it ſelf in many things is compelled to ſerve the Cerebel and its Government, as we have already ſhewn, and is neceſſarily bound to it. For the Brain owes much to the Cerebel, foraſmuch as it receives from the vital Function (which is of its Province) the proviſion of the blood, and by conſequence the Tribute of the Spirits produced of it: ſo indeed that both theſe parts, though Principals, perform mutual offices, and as it were in a circle, require and accompliſh ſervices one for another.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of the relation or mutual reſpect of either Appendix of the Cerebel, to wit, of the anterior, which are the orbicular Prominences; and the poſterior, <hi>viz.</hi> the Annular Protuberance: Alſo of the remaining portion of the oblong Marrow continued into the Spinal Marrow.</head>
                           <p>BEſides the aforeſaid Nerves, to wit, the fourth, fifth, ſixth, ſeventh, and eighth pair which are imployed for the performing the tacit Edicts of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebel for every involuntary Function, and thoſe equal in number to the reſt ſubject to the Brain, that cauſe the Cerebel to have an Empire divided with it; there are alſo ſome Proceſſes and Protuberances, which being placed before and behind the Cerebel, are its Appendixes, that are taken into part of the ſame Office and Miniſtry. The deſcription and uſe of theſe, are already particularly delivered. But for that (as a while ſince we intimated) there happens a certain reſpect or habit between the orbicular Prominences, which is the anterior Appendix of the Cerebel, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nular Protuberance, which is the other poſterior Appendix of the ſame, and that one part is proportionate to the magnitude of the other; ſo as when the natiform Prominences are greater or greateſt, the annular Protuberance is always ſmaller or ſmalleſt; and on the contrary, they who have this latter in a very great bulk, in them the other is leſſer; and ſo for that either part ſeems to be a peculiar Repoſitory of the Spirits, which belong to the oeconomy of the Cerebel, when a greater proviſion of them is laid up in one Store-houſe, therefore there reſides a leſſer in the other; when I ſay there is this kind of conſtant relation found between theſe parts, it yet remains for us to find out for what end this is ſo conſtituted.</p>
                           <p>Seeing that the animal Spirits are diſpoſed within the ſeveral parts of the Head in diſtinct Schemes of Rays, through which are variouſly tranſmitted, as through Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective-glaſſes, the impreſſions of ſenſible things and the inſtincts of motions to be performed; it eaſily occurs, that there are commerces had this way and that way in the natiform Prominences between the Brain and Cerebel; and that the Spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting the annular Protuberance are <hi>Inter nuncii</hi> or Meſſengers going between, which transfer the mutual reſpects of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> as alſo of the parts that are wont to be pathetically moved. But if it be inquired into, what kind of commerces and reſpects thoſe are which the Brain carries to the Cerebel, and on the contrary, and that either have to the Organs of the vital and merely natural Function, we ſhall in ſo difficult and very intricate a matter propoſe our Opinion, though with an heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating and doubtful mind.</p>
                           <p>We have before intimated, that the orbicular Prominences did deliver to the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebel the forces of the Paſſions to be carried from the Brain to the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and did receive from it, and communicate to the Brain the neceſſities of the natural Inſtincts delivered from the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera</hi> to the Cerebel. To theſe moreover we add, that the annular Protuberance ſerves wholly for the ſame offices, though after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner; to wit, this receives the forces of the Paſſions, as it were at a ſecond hand, from the Deputiſhip of the Cerebel, and transfers them then immediately to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:152521:168"/>
the <hi>Praecordia;</hi> and this ſeems to be the chiefeſt office of this part. Further, the ſame Ring receives immediately the natural Inſtincts from the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the middle and loweſt Belly, and impreſſes them on the Cerebel to be conveyed further to the Brain; which kind of uſe it exhibits ſecondarily by affording only a way of paſſage: For indeed ſuch Inſtincts having paſt through the Cerebel, we ſuppoſe to be formed and perfected within the orbicular Prominences, from whence being tranſmitted into the Brain, they draw forth requiſite actions without the previous knowledge of it, or intention of doing.</p>
                           <p>Hence it may be ſuppoſed, that the annular Protuberance contains chiefly the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits which perform the inteſtine commotions of the Affections. In every vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſion of the Soul, preſently the <hi>Praecordia</hi> are greatly troubled, to wit, the ſame being variouſly drawn together or ſpread abroad, compel the blood into divers fluctuations; but indeed a great company of the Spirits, ſomewhere got together and ready for Excurſions in a ſet Battel, do perform theſe diſorders and irregular motions of the <hi>Praecordia;</hi> and for that the Spirits can be diſpoſed for this in no other part than here, before the beginnings of the Nerves, conſtituted for theſe offices; therefore this Protuberance in a man, by reaſon of the ragings of the Paſſions to be performed by a certain force and incitation, is far greater than in any other Animal. For as he is wont to be ſuddenly and vehemently diſturbed, therefore the Promptua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Store-houſe is required to be more large, in which a greater plenty of Spirits may be kept, to be beſtowed on ſuch inordinations of the Affections. Next to a man this part is greateſt in a Dog, Cat, and Fox; in a Calf, Sheep, Goat, Hare, and other milder Animals it is very ſmall.</p>
                           <p>But as the annular Protuberance ſeems to be the chief Organ or Cheſt of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, from whence the winds of the Paſſions, deſtinated for the exciting the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> are conveyed into the breaſt; ſo we ſuppoſe the orbicular Prominences to be a means of paſſage, and the very inſtruments whereby the inſtincts and neceſſities of the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera</hi> are communicated from the Cerebel to the Brain. Yea, the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits dwelling in this, as a retiring place, do not only tranſmit theſe kind of Ideas or formal Reaſons of the Inſtincts, but in ſome meaſure form and prepare them for the Brain. For when as ſome brute Animals, whoſe Brain is not imbued with a previous knowledge or practical habits, chuſe and bring forth ſome ſpontaneous actions as it were with judgment and deliberation, certainly we may believe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of theſe kind of acts are ſuggeſted from ſome other place than the Brain, to wit, from the aforeſaid Prominences. Wherefore 'tis to be obſerved, that in ſome Brutes endued with an indocil or dull Brain, the Buttock-like Prominences are greateſt, as may be ſeen in a Calf, Sheep, Hog, and many others; which Animals, as ſoon as they are brought to light, preſently ſeek for their food, and what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous for them they readily know. But in a Man, a Dog, Fox, and the like, who are more apt to learn and acquire habits, theſe Prominences are very ſmall; and theſe Animals being newly born, are furniſhed only with a rude and imperfect ſenſe; beſides, they are found wholly unapt to ſeek out their food. Upon this Obſervation (which holds good in moſt Animals which I have yet happened to diſſect) as upon a Baſis or foundation I dare build this kind of abſtruſe Hypotheſis concerning the natural Inſtincts and Affections of the <hi>Praecordia.</hi> For as the living Creatures which are more ſtrong in inſtinct, as Sheep, Hogs, Oxen, Goats, and other ſlow and gentler beaſts, that are not obnoxious to Paſſions, are alſo leſs docile or apt to learn; and on the contrary, they in whom the Affections are wont to predominate, and who are furniſhed with a certain wit, (as beſides Man, are Dogs, Foxes, and ſome other hotter Animals) are leſs powerful in Inſtinct: and as I have obſerved in the frequent Diſſection of all ſorts of Heads, that in thoſe kind of living Creatures, who live rather by Wit than Inſtinct, the annular Protuberance, placed below the Cerebel, was notedly great, and the orbicular Prominences only very ſmall; but in other living Creatures, where the Inſtinct exceeded the wit, and who were leſs prone to ſtrong Affections, the orbicular Prominences were very great, and on the contrary, the ringy Protuberance exceeding ſmall: From hence I was forced to think, that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicular or natiform Prominences, where they are great, are inſtead of another or ſupplementory Brain, and the chief Organs of the natural Inſtincts; yet ſo, as theſe parts alſo ſerve for a way or means of paſſage for the transferring the Paſſions from the Brain towards the Cerebel and <hi>Praecordia;</hi> and that (as we have already hinted) the greater exiſtency of the annular Protuberance is to contain plenty of Spirits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:152521:168"/>
for the winds of the Paſſions; yet in the mean time, by a further tending forwards or declination of the Spirits inhabiting this, the Species of the natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts, being ſent from the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> paſs through. But however the buſineſs is, becauſe nothing can be certainly affirmed, or by demonſtration, if this our Opinion pleaſe not others, at leaſt it may be pardoned.</p>
                           <p>There remains not much more to be ſpoken concerning the Offices and Uſes of the Cerebel and its Appendix. Concerning its ſubſtance, there is ſomething more worthy taking notice of, to wit, that it very much differs in this reſpect from the ſtructure of the Brain alſo, for that its cortical little circles are not founded in the ſtretched out Marrow, as the convolutions of the Brain; but being deeply cut in, are diſcontinued in their whole tract: ſo that the whole Syſtem of the Cerebel is as it were a cluſter of Grapes compacted cloſely together; in which, although the Berries be contiguous, yet they remain diſtinct one from another, and bring forth fiſſures through the whole thickneſs of the maſs. Yea the outward ſuperficies of the Cerebel conſiſts as it were of very many Tubercles or little Tad-ſtoles or Puffs which grow together on little ſtalks; and thoſe ſtalks paſs into greater branches, and they at length being bipartite or twofold, go together into two larger Marrows near the bottom of the Cerebel, in either of which are three diſtinct medullary Proceſſes: of which threefold proceſſes on either ſide we have already ſpoken. But of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the uſe of the Cerebel in general, we ſhall yet further advertiſe you, that as very much of its ſubſtance is cortical, it begets animal Spirits in great plenty, to which in the circulating there is not granted, as in the Brain, an equally great ſpace; for that there ſeems not to be much need of it in the animal Government. For the Spirits ſo produced in the Cerebel plentifully by a perpetual emanation, ought to flow outwardly for the offices of the natural and vital Function: but more inwardly for the impulſes variouſly ſent into them, they admit certain undulations or wavings, by which ſome occaſional acts of the involuntary Function are brought forth, as is ſhewn before.</p>
                           <p>But as it is manifeſt enough, that the animal Spirits are generated within the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical little circles of the Cerebel, it doth not ſeem needful that we ſhould ordain their Work-houſe in the Ventricle ſubject to its frame. For that Cavity (as we have already ſhewn) is only an empty ſpace, which lying under its double little foot and medullar Trunk, comes between it and the overlying bunching out of the Cerebel. But indeed there belongs to this beſides a certain uſe, to wit, that the ſerous watry heap laid aſide out of the Glandula's and infoldings of the Veſſels, as alſo from the ſubſtance of the Cerebel, being made over-moiſt, diſtilling down, might ſlide into this Ciſtern. From whence, leſt it ſhould flow down upon the beginnings of the Nerves, by a reſtraining Membrane it is compelled into the hole of the ſtrait Den lying under the orbicular Prominences; and from thence is received from the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning aperture of the Tunnel, and carried out.</p>
                           <p>Below the Cerebel, the oblong Marrow going forward with the reſt of its tract even to the hole of the hinder part of the Head, ends at length in the ſpinal Marrow: but in its Trunk, as yet contained within the Skull, beſides the Nerves and Proceſſes but now recited, the beginnings of the ninth and tenth pair of Nerves are alſo radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. Of which there will be hereafter a proper place to ſpeak, when we ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the whole Neurology or the Doctrine of the Nerves. In the mean time, we ſhall take notice of the beginning of the ninth pair, which is peculiar in Man, and different from what is found in Brutes: To wit, in Man below the origine of the eighth pair, a certain Protuberance grows to either ſide of the oblong Marrow. Out of that four or five diſtinct Fibres do come forth; one or two of which binds about the Vertebral Artery paſſing through it, but all grow together into the ſame Trunk, which is the Nerve of the aforeſaid pair. This Protuberance, the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> being pulled away, may be eaſily ſeen, and ſeems to be the Repoſitory or Store-houſe of the Spirits deſtinated to this Nerve.</p>
                           <p>For as this Nerve is beſtowed on the Tongue and its Muſcles, and ſo conduces chiefly to the performing of ſpeech in Man, who hath a greater and more frequent uſe and exerciſe of the voice, there ſeems to be need of a great proviſion of Spirits, plenty of which ought always to be in a readineſs. But in Brutes, who have none, or a rarer neceſſity of the voice, ſuch a Protuberance is wanting, becauſe it is not required in them that the Spirits ſhould be gathered together by heaps, as it were in a certain Porch, before the Organs of the Voice, but that it may ſuffice for them to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:152521:169"/>
be called forth by degrees out of the common tract of the oblong Marrow. Further, whereas ſome fibres of this Nerve bind about either Vertebral Artery, unleſs I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that is ſo ordained for this end, leſt perhaps in ſpeaking, when at any time we are more vehemently moved, the blood being ſtirred up, might ruſh upon the Brain with a torrent. For this Nerve binding about the Vertebral Artery, as it were with a bridle, and ſo as a Moderator not only of the Tongue, but alſo of the Blood, reſtrains its more rapid influence. After the ſame manner, and for no other ends, do the recurrent Nerves, deſtinated to ſome part of the ſame office, variouſly bind about the Trunk of the great Artery, as ſhall be ſhewn afterwards.</p>
                           <p>As ſoon as this inferior portion of the oblong Marrow is uncloathed from the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> the pyramidal bodies come in view otherwiſe lying hid. Theſe in all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, endued with the annular Protuberance, are conſtantly found; alſo as that Protuberance is bigger, ſo theſe bodies appear more noted: but indeed in a Man and a Dog they ſeem like two large Nerves, which being produced out of that Ring, end over againſt where the eighth pair ariſe in ſharp points. If the uſe of theſe be ſought into, it is moſt likely, that the animal Spirits ſuperabounding in the annular proviſion or ſtore, do flow out as it were by theſe Emiſſaries, which Spirits however run into the beginnings of the eighth pair placed near, and ſo are beſtowed by their proper means on the offices of the involuntary Function.</p>
                           <p>Although the oblong Marrow retains not its name beyond the limits of the Skull; yet it is the ſame ſubſtance, which from thence being continued further into the cavity and utmoſt receſſes of the whole Spine or Back-bone, is called the Spinal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: but it is brought forth for this, that the Nerves to be diſtributed into the Limbs and Members more remote from the Head, might more commodiouſly ariſe out of the ſame medullar ſubſtance ſtretched out into the neighbourhood of every part. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all this whole medullar Trunk, which is continued from the bottom of the Brain even to the <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> ſeems like the Pneumatick Cheſt, or Bellows of a pair of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, which includes the blaſt or breath deſtinated to every Pipe; for in like manner the animal Spirits are contained in this marrowy tract, which blow up and actuate all the Nerves hanging thereto, as occaſion ſerves.</p>
                           <p>If you behold the origine of the whole, it ſeems that the whole frame both of this oblong Marrow and the ſpinal, is of a medullar or marrowy ſubſtance, every where growing diſperſedly through the Brain and Cerebel, and then being gathered more round together in the middle of either, becomes as one heap. For the Marrows beſmearing all their folds and turnings about, are as ſo many little rivers, which ſpringing from thence, begin to be congregated in the middle, and to be poured out in one great one; but being from thence united, they make the oblong Marrow, as it were the chanel of the Sea, big enough for the motion or ebbing and flowing and reciprocation of the animal Spirits: which belly or chanel, however ſtretching it ſelf further beyond the Skull, is increaſed into the ſpinal Marrow, as it were the boſom or proceſs of the former.</p>
                           <p>But as the medullar tracts, beſmearing the folds and convolutions of the Brain and Cerebel, unfold themſelves into their middle Marrows and medullar Trunk, and ſo the Spirits ſpringing diſperſedly from their firſt fountains, congregate as it were into a certain diffuſed Sea; ſo from this Sea, cauſing an ebbing and flowing, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual or very frequent influence of the animal Spirit, the ſame Spirits flow out into the depending chanels of the nervous Syſtem.</p>
                           <p>Concerning this part of this Marrow, which being included in the long boſom or chanel of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> or Back-bone, and according to all their joyntings, being mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with as it were knotty proceſſes, is called the Spinal, there occur not many things worthy conſideration, beſides what are commonly known. The figure, ſituation, as alſo the body of this, in its whole tract, are known generally to be cloven in two, not only by Anatomiſts, but by every Butcher. The ramifications or branchings of the Nerves, proceeding from the ſpinal Marrow, are delivered hereafter. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning its conformation ſomething peculiar occurs. For as the ſpinal Marrow is as it were the common paſſage or chanel of the Spirits flowing out of the Head into the Nerves, it may be obſerved, that this chanel, not after the uſual manner of other paſſages, where many rivers flow in, doth ſwell up more; but on the contrary, in what place it hath more and greater Emiſſaries, its magnitude is increaſed; for in thoſe parts of the ſpinal Marrow, out of which the brachial and crural Nerves ariſe, (or thoſe Nerves belonging to the Arms and Legs, whoſe beginnings are more and larger)
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:152521:169"/>
its Trunk becomes much thicker than in the reſt of the frame or ſubſtance. The reaſon of this is, becauſe within the medullar tracts the animal Spirits run not, nor paſs through with ſo ſwift a paſſage, but for the moſt part flowing leiſurely from their Fountains, when they have filled the whole ſpace, they ſtay therein; and as many Spirits, upon occaſion offered, are wont to be beſtowed on every work, thoſe remaining there in readineſs frame certain convenient Promptuaries where they may divert themſelves. Wherefore we ordinarily obſerve, not only of this Marrow, but of the Nerves themſelves, that as often as a ſmall branch is diſtributed into many ſhoots or ſuckers to be ſent forth here and there, always in the very knot of the diviſion there grows a far greater fold than in the reſt of the Trunk of the Nerve; ſo that 'tis a wonder from whence the Nerve ſhould acquire ſo in the middle of its paſſage a new ſubſtance and more ample bulk. But of theſe things and others belonging to the Doctrine of the Nerves, it behoves us to diſcourſe in the following Chapters.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Of the Nervous Syſtem in general, where its parts (which are the Nerves and Fibres) being deſigned, a proſpect of the whole Animal Government is exhibited.</head>
                           <p>WHenas hitherto having beheld the ſeveral Regions of the Brain it ſelf, the Cerebel, and medullar Appendix, and the proviſion and offices of them all, we have deſigned or drawn forth the uſes and employments alſo of the parts and proceſſes, and the ſanguiferous Veſſels belonging to every one of theſe; it is now time for me to ſtop and retire into the Port from this troubleſom and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Sea of Diſquiſition: But indeed, becauſe I find that I have not yet reached to the fartheſt ſhores and utmoſt parts; but that beyond this Sea, which we have ſailed through, as yet the nervous Syſtem, and very many Creeks or Boſoms, Meanders, and highly intricate Receſſes or private places in it remain to be viewed; therefore although we know it is difficult to proceed with full Sail, we have reſolved to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the task of the Doctrine of the Nerves; and the rather, becauſe without the perfect knowledge of the Nerves the Doctrine of the Brain and its Appendix would be left wholly lame and imperfect; for neither what hath already been delivered concerning them can be ſufficiently underſtood or illuſtrated, nor (which I chiefly deſire, and is the end of the former Diſquiſitions) without thoſe things before known can the Pathology of the Brain and nervous ſtock be rightly inſtituted. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there are many things which might eaſily deter any one from ſuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking: to wit, the hardneſs of the work, and full of hazard; which promiſes at firſt ſight more difficulty and thorny labour, than pleaſure or profit. Then ſome will object, that this Province is already ſo perfectly cultivated, and adorned by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Anatomiſts, that by a repetition of the ſame, I may ſeem to have medled with a thing done to my hand. But I may readily anſwer to theſe, firſt, That the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Nerves yields more pleaſant and profitable Speculations, than the Theory of any parts beſides in the animated Body: for from hence the true and genuine Reaſons are drawn of very many Actions and Paſſions that are wont to happen in our Body, which otherwiſe ſeem moſt difficult and unexplicable; and no leſs from this Fountain the hidden Cauſes of Diſeaſes and their Symptoms, which commonly are aſcribed to the Incantations of Witches, may be found out and clearly laid open. But as to our Obſervations about the Nerves, from our following Diſcourſe it will plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that I have not trod the paths or footſteps of others, nor repeated what hath been before told.</p>
                           <p>Therefore that according to our determination we may enter upon the explanation of the nervous Syſtem, we ſhall comprehend under this name all parts, upon which gifted with the animal Spirit, Motion and Senſe neceſſarily and immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, to wit, for the performing either one only, or both together in the whole Body. But theſe kind of parts, in reſpect of the Head and marrowy Appendix, are like a branching ſtock or imps growing out of the trunk of a Tree: for ſuppoſing that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:152521:170"/>
the cortical ſubſtances of the Brain and Cerebel are in the place of roots, and that the ſubſtances every where medullar are taken for the ſtock or pith; the nervous ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination or budding forth expanded into divarications of Nerves and Fibres, will appear like ſo many little branches, twigs, and leaves. Or if the Head containing in it ſelf the chief part and power of the ſenſitive Soul, be taken for the body of ſome Luminary, as of the Sun or a Star; the nervous Syſtem ſhall be that radiant or beamy concretion compaſſing it about. Becauſe the animal Spirits flowing from the Brain and Cerebel, with the medullar Appendix of either, as it were from a double Luminary, irradiate the nervous Syſtem, and ſo conſtitute its ſeveral parts, the Organs of Motion or Senſe, or of both together, as hath been ſaid.</p>
                           <p>The parts of the nervous Syſtem, as a radiant or beamy texture, are either pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, <hi>viz.</hi> the bodies themſelves of the Nerves, into which the animal Spirits im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately flow from the Head and its medullar Appendix; or ſecondarily, which are Fibres planted or interwoven in the Membranes, muſculous Fleſh, Tendons, and ſome of the Parenchyma, which alſo contain in themſelves animal Spirits, but they receive them not but mediately and ſecondarily derived from the Head through the bodies of the Nerves.</p>
                           <p>We have already ſhewed that the animal Spirits are procreated only in the Brain and Cerebel, from which they continually ſpringing forth, inſpire and fill full the medullar Trunk: (like the Cheſt of a muſical Organ, which receives the wind to be blown into all the Pipes) but thoſe Spirits being carried from thence into the Nerves, as into ſo many Pipes hanging to the ſame, blow them up and actuate them with a full influence; then what flow over or abound from the Nerves, enter the Fibres diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed every where in the Membranes, Muſcles, and other parts, and ſo impart to thoſe bodies, in which the nervous Fibres are interwoven, a motive and ſenſitive or feeling force. And theſe Spirits of every part are called Implanted, foraſmuch as they flow not within the Nerves, as the former, with a perpetual flood; but being ſomething more ſtable and conſtant, ſtay longer in the ſubject bodies; and only as occaſion ſerves, <hi>viz.</hi> according to the impreſſions inwardly received from the Nerves, or impreſſed outwardly by the objects, are ordained into divers ſtretchings or carryings out for the effecting of motion or ſenſe either of this or that manner or kind.</p>
                           <p>Indeed the animal Spirits flowing within the Nerves with a living Spring, like Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers from a perpetual Fountain, do not ſtagnate or ſtand ſtill; but ſliding forth with a continual courſe, are ever ſupplied and kept full with a new influence from the Fountain. In the mean time, the Spirits in the reſt of the nervous kind, eſpecially thoſe abounding in the Membranes and muſculous ſtock, are like Ponds and Lakes of Waters lately diffuſed from the chanels of Rivers, whoſe waters ſtanding ſtill are not much moved of their own accord; but being agitated by things caſt into them, or by the blaſts of winds, conceive divers ſorts of fluctuations.</p>
                           <p>But becauſe there is no light difference between the motions and conſiſtency of the Spirits and of Waters, perhaps it will better illuſtrate the matter, if the Spirits of either kind, to wit, the inflowing and implanted, are compared to the beaming forth of divers rays of light. And ſo when light is let into a dark chamber, and preſently inlightens the whole, we may conceive the particles of the light ſo ſwiftly diffuſed to be of a twofold kind; to wit, ſome are bodies ſent from the light it ſelf, which diffuſe themſelves every way into an Orb; and other luminous particles are as it were Etherial little bodies exiſting before in the pores of the Air, which being agitated by the former, and as it were inkindled, cauſe as it were a flamy, though moſt thin contexture, ſtretched out in the whole clearneſs. After the like manner, the animal Spirits flowing from the medullar ſubſtance into the Nerves, are as it were rays dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed from the light it ſelf, and the other Spirits every where abounding in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, are as ſo many lucid particles included and implanted in the Air, which are actuated by the former, and being ſtirred up by them into motion, perform the acts both of the ſenſitive and locomotive Faculty.</p>
                           <p>That it may the better appear by what means the animal Spirits do irradiate and ſwiftly paſs through the parts of the nervous Syſtem, both primary and ſecondary; ſo that light is ſcarcely carried ſwifter through a diaphanous Medium, than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the Spirits is made from one end of the nervous Syſtem to the other; it will be requiſite to inquire here a little concerning the Origine of the Nerves and nervous Fibres, alſo of their Fabrick and Conformation, to wit, what pores and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages either of theſe bodies have, and how diſpoſed for the paſſing through and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the animal Spirits.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="127" facs="tcp:152521:170"/>As to the Nerves, it is manifeſt from what hath been ſaid, that all of them are produced immediately out of the medullar Trunk or its proceſſes; ſo that as theſe parts are the common and broad roads which lead both from the Brain and from the Cerebel, all the Nerves are particular paths reaching out from them on every ſide into the ſeveral Regions of the animated Body. Wherefore the ſame Marrow, which is the original of every Nerve or Sinew, foraſmuch as it is drawn into a more thin thread, conſtitutes the matter of the ſame Nerve; which indeed, that it may be made more ſolid and compact, is cloathed with a peculiar production of the <hi>Pia Mater:</hi> for as from a Silver maſs gilt or inriched with Gold, all the threads produced from it are gilded; ſo the ſame Membrane, which covers the medullar Trunk, is produced together with all the Nerves coming out from the ſame, and cloathes them all. Further, very many Nerves ariſing together out of that marrowy beginning, go forth as it were by bands; which notwithſtanding, for the ſake of the better paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, being preſently united and carried out of their bony Cloiſter, are included in a common Coat taken from the <hi>Dura Mater.</hi> For we ſuppoſe (which alſo ſhall be more clearly ſhewed anon) that all the Nerves, deſtinated to any parts or every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular member, do ariſe diſtinctly and apart, and ſo remain in their whole paſſage. But in that oftentimes a Nerve appearing as it were one Trunk, afterwards ſeems to go into many branches, it is becauſe thoſe branches being indeed ſingular, and divided in the whole paſſage, are collected as it were into one bundle; for ſometimes we have ſeparated thoſe Nerves, ſeeming to grow together as it were into one rope or cord of a Nerve, one from another, dividing them to their very original; for neither otherwiſe could the Inſtincts of the Motions to be performed be carried ſo reſpectively to theſe or thoſe parts, ſeparate one from another, to which the branches of the ſame Trunk belong.</p>
                           <p>The paſſages of the Nerves are not bored through as the Veins and Arteries; for the ſubſtance of thoſe are not only impervious to any Bodkin, but no cavity can be ſeen in them, no not by the help of Spectacles or a Microſcope. As to what belongs to the ſmelling little Pipes, they ſeem to be ſo made, not for the paſſage of the animal Spirits, but that ſome ſeroſities might ſlide down that way: but the Spirits themſelves are carried in the ſides, and not in the cavity of either Pipe; but the ſubſtance of the other Nerves appears plainly firm and compacted, that the ſubtil humor, which is the Vehicle of the Spirits, may paſs through their frames or ſubſtances, even as the ſpirits of Wine, the extended ſtrings of a Lute, only by creeping leiſurely through. Hence it may be argued, that becauſe the animal Spirits require no manifeſt cavity within the Nerves for their expanſion; neither is there need of the like for them within the ſubſtance of the Brain; but that the Ventricles, commonly ſo called, ought to be deputed to ſome other office than this.</p>
                           <p>But the Nerves are white, ſmooth, and round bodies: within the Skull and nigh their beginnings, being as it were only covered with the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> they are ſoft and eaſily broken; without this, for that many of them are for the moſt part gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, and alſo cloathed with the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> they become ſomewhat hard and more tenacious. The Nerves themſelves (as may be diſcovered by the help of a Microcoſm or Perſpective-glaſs) are furniſhed throughout with pores and paſſages, as it were ſo many little holes in a Honey-comb, thickly ſet, made hollow, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous one by another; ſo the Tube-like ſubſtance of them, like an <hi>Indian</hi> Cane, is every where porous and pervious. Within theſe little ſpaces the animal Spirits or very ſubtil little Bodies, and of their own nature ever in a readineſs for motion, do gently flow; to which is joyned, both for a Vehicle, as alſo for a Bridle or ſtay, a watry Latex, and that it ſelf of very ſubtil parts, This Humor diffuſes with its flui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity the Spirits through the whole nervous Syſtem; alſo by its viſcoſity retains them, that they be not wholly diſſipated, but as it were in a certain <hi>Syſtaſis</hi> and continued Series; for it ſeems, that without ſuch an Humor the Spirits could not conſiſt within the nervous ſtock, but they would vaniſh away into Air. Further, the ſame Humor is no leſs required for the paſſing through of the ſenſible Species: becauſe the animal Spirits, we ſuppoſe, like the rays of Light, to be diffuſed through the whole nervous Syſtem; and thoſe rays, unleſs the humid particles of the Air be mingled with them, do not eaſily tranſmit the forms or images of things; as is obvious in an Optick Scene, which is hid or ſhadowed by the clear beams or brightneſs of the Sun. And in like manner, from the defect or depravation of the nervous Juyce, we can readily ſhew, that the inordinations of the animal Spirits, and oftentimes moſt horrid diſtempers of the Brain and the nervous ſtock do ariſe.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="128" facs="tcp:152521:171"/>This nervous Juyce being derived from the Brain and Cerebel into the medullar Appendix, is carried from thence by a gentle ſliding down through the Nerves even into the whole nervous ſtock, and waters its whole Syſtem. Upon the equal ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this depends the expanſion of the animal Spirits through the whole; and the ſubſtance of theſe, yea the Hypoſtaſis of the ſenſitive Soul it ſelf is founded on the diffuſion of the ſame humor. The animal Spirits being left to themſelves, follow the motion of this Juyce, and flowing together with it in the ſame courſe, are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly or quietly expatiated; but in the mean time, as occaſion is offered, the ſame Spirits, as a breath moving upon thoſe waters, conceive other ſpreadings abroad, and thoſe more rapid. For as in a River, from winds or any thing caſt in, divers undulations or wavings are ſtirred up; ſo the animal Spirits being raiſed up by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for the performing the offices of ſenſe and motion, do tend this way or that way to and fro within the nervous ſtock, and are agitated hither and thither by other means.</p>
                           <p>But to return to the parts of the nervous Syſtem, beſides the Nerves themſelves, Fibres alſo being diſperſedly interwoven in the Membranes, the muſculous Fleſh, the Parenchyma, and other parts, and united in the Tendons, are the Organs of ſenſe and motion. Yea, the acts of their faculties are principally and more immediately executed by the Fibres than the Nerves; for they, by drawing together the Muſcle and other motive parts, cauſe the motion it ſelf; but the Nerves only carry from the Head the inſtinct for the performing of that motion. In like manner, in Senſation the Fibres receive firſt of all and immediately the impreſſions of ſenſible things, and expreſs the ſame (as muſical ſtrings do the ſtrikings of a quill or fingers) by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal modification of the Particles, and repreſent the various approaches of the object by the like motion of the Fibrils, as by a moveable and fluid Character, whoſe Idea the Nerves transfer only to the Head.</p>
                           <p>Concerning the nervous Fibres it behoves us to inquire from whence they have their riſe? For it appears plainly, that they ariſe not immediately from the Head or its medullar Appendix; nor is it leſs improbable, that they are produced (as 'tis common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid) from the Nerves: becauſe what is aſſerted, that the Fibres are productions of the Nerves, and little bits or pieces of them torn off, as it were into hairy branches, ſeems unlikely; for that the Fibres in ſome parts, being placed nigh, exceed in their bulk the magnitude of the Nerve that is brought to that part, at leaſt an hundred-fold: which thing appears clearly from the Tendon of every Muſcle, which being made up of united Fibres, is obſerved to be far greater than the Nerve inſerted to it. And indeed for almoſt the like reaſon we are induced to think the nervous Humor it ſelf alſo, whereby the Membranes and muſculous Fibres are wont to be watered, to be derived unto them not by the only means and paſſage of the Nerves; becauſe it is heaped up much more plentifully and in more abundance than can be carried thither through thoſe narrow paſſages, as appears clearly in Ulcers of the Kings Evil, or in Impoſtumes or Wounds of the Tendons and nervous parts, in which a glutinous Humor drops forth in ſo great abundance, that all the Nerves of the whole Body could ſcarce be able to ſupply it.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore concerning theſe, it ſeems that we may affirm, that the Fibres are not continued portions of the Nerves broken off into little hairy ſtrings or Capillaments; and that all the Fibres originally proceed not from the Nerves, becauſe ſome of them, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe interwoven to the Heart and its Veſſels are of equal birth with the Nerves themſelves, and coexiſt with them together from the beginning. However moſt Fibres, as to their production, depend upon the Nerves; and all, which way ſoever brought forth, receive conſtantly from the Nerves the forces and ſupplements of the animal Spirits, and alſo the Inſtincts of the Motions to be performed by them.</p>
                           <p>Therefore to recount the births or kinds of Fibres; they are firſt either ſpermatick and firſt begotten, the rudiments or firſt beginnings of which being of the like anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity as the Heart and Brain, placed in the Conception, afterwards leiſurely increaſe; to wit, ſuch are, as hath been ſaid, thoſe in the Heart it ſelf in its depending Veſſels, the Membranes and ſome other parts, which form the firſt ſtuff or threads of the Embryo: or ſecondly, other Fibres are produced ſecondarily, and by a ſecond birth; of which ſort chiefly are ſuch which are interwoven into the parts taken for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of the animal Fabrick, and eſpecially thoſe termed Sanguineous, which we think to be begotten after this manner.</p>
                           <p>The Heart and Brain, with the Arteries and Nerves hanging to them, are primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious parts, and highly original; but theſe, for the ſecond birth of others, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:152521:171"/>
for the nutrition and increaſe of all the ſenſitive parts, diſtribute a twofold humor; <hi>viz.</hi> one ſpirituous and endued with very active Particles which perpetually flow, though but in a very ſmall quantity, through the paſſages of the Nerves from the Brain and Cerebel; and the other ſlow and ſofter, which being every where laid aſide through the Arteries from the bloody maſs, is rendred more plentifully. This latter being of it ſelf dull and thicker by much, is actuated by the former, and being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued by it, as by a certain Ferment, acquires ſtrength and power of growth or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation. But indeed the nervous Juyce, foraſmuch as it diffuſes with it ſelf the animal Spirits, imparts to every part, beſides the faculties of Motion and Senſe, the determinations alſo of form and figure. Further, whilſt that, being joyned to the other arterious humor, is diſpoſed into the ſubſtance and matter of the member or part to be nouriſhed, it forms ſome tracts as it were, to wit, the Fibres themſelves, in which the animal Spirits, coming together with them, reſide and are expatiated. Theſe twofold or twin humors, coupling together in every ſenſitive part, conſtitute a liquor truly nutritious, to wit, which is both ſpirituous and nouriſhable. And in truth, both theſe Juyces, <hi>viz.</hi> the nervous and arterious, being married together, are as it were the male and female ſeed, which being mingled in a fruitful womb, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the plaſtick Humor, by whoſe virtue the living creature is formed and increaſes. Hence may be obſerved, as the particles of the ſpirituous liquor, or of the other more watry juyce (<hi>viz.</hi> this latter being ſupplied from the Arteries, or that from the Nerves) are ſtrong or excel, as to their properties or powers, all living creatures become more or leſs nimble, active, and ready to any motion and labour. Beſides, from the default or depravation of the one and the other humor excelling, the ſorts or kinds of this or that diſeaſe are excited; concerning which, and alſo what belongs to the explication of the nutritious Humor, we may perhaps have ſome other time occaſion to diſcourſe.</p>
                           <p>The animal Spirits which enter and fill the ordained ſeries of the Fibres as ſo many little places, flow thither by the paſſages of the Nerves; notwithſtanding the Spirits which are ſeated in the Fibres, interwoven with the muſculous ſtock, receive nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, yea and as it were auxiliary forces, from the arterious blood there plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully flowing: whereby indeed both the Spirits themſelves acquire for the performing of Motions a greater force and as it were elaſtick; ſo that their force being ſtirred up by a ſtrong endeavour, it ſeems like the exploſion of Gun-powder; and alſo the ſame Spirits being continually conſumed within the Muſcles more profuſely than is wont to be in the Membranes and other parts, are in ſome meaſure made up or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired from the bloody ſuſtenance: becauſe whenas the arterious Juyce joyns more plentifully with the nervous flowing within the ſanguineous parts, it may be well thought, that it alſo lays upon the Spirits brought thither with it, as it were ſome nitroſulphureous particles, and intimately fixes them on them; and ſo, by reaſon of this Copula, highly flatuous and apt to be rarified, the Spirits themſelves become there more active, ſo that in every motive endeavour, whereby the Muſcle is ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly intumified, they, as if inkindled, are exploded. Moreover, a ſudden refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the conſumed or waſted Spirits, after great exerciſe or labour, is for this reaſon alſo performed by the blood; for that the ſpirituous particles being left and forſaken by motion, preſently a new Copula of the ſame kind of matter, apt for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſion, is joyned to them. For it is not poſſible, that the immenſe loſs of Spirits which happens in hard labours (if they were wholly deſtroyed) in ſo ſhort a time, ſhould be able to be reſtored by ſupplements coming only through the Nerves. We ſhall diſcourſe more largely of theſe things, if at any time hereafter we ſhall treat of the Motions of the Muſcles.</p>
                           <p>The animal Spirits being diſpoſed within the ſeveral Muſcles, according to the ſeries of Fibres, ſeem as it were ſo many diſtinct Troops or Companies of Souldiers; all which being ſet as it were in a Watch-tower, are ordained, as a new impreſſion is carried to them by the Nerves, either from the objects outwardly, or more inwardly from the Head, forthwith into various forms and peculiar orders for the performing of motion or ſenſe of this or that kind. The carriage or behaviour of theſe is worth the ſeeing in an animal newly killed and its skin taken off. For when life periſhes, and all the force of the Spirits flowing in through the Nerves hath quite ceaſed; yet the Spirits implanted into the whole Body breaking forth from the Muſcles, ſtill move and ſhake them, and force them into ſeveral Convulſions and trembling motions.</p>
                           <p>From what hath been ſaid we may gather, what the diſpoſition or order of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:152521:172"/>
animal Spirits may be in the whole animal Body: to wit, thoſe procreated in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſubſtance both of the Brain and Cerebel, are congregated into the middles of either, as it were into diſtinct Empories or Marts; and an expanſion being made in either, they cauſe certain interior powers of the ſenſitive Soul to be exerciſed; yet the ſame Spirits, affecting more room, enter the oblong Marrow (as it were the Cheſt, as hath been ſaid, of a muſical Organ) and fill it full; within which flowing, they carry to and fro the impreſſions of ſenſible Things and the Inſtincts of Motions. From the oblong and ſpinal Marrow the ſame Spirits, unleſs when they are otherwiſe buſied, tending outwardly, flow towards the ſeveral parts of the whole Body; which notwithſtanding wandring ſo out of doors, becauſe they paſs through very ſtrait ways in their paſſage, to wit, the ſlender bodies of the Nerves, they break not forth in heaps, or in a thick troop, but only contracted orderly, and as it were by bands or diviſions: but they being carried beyond the extremities of the Nerves, and there poſſeſſing the Membranes, Muſcles, and other ſenſible parts, dilate themſelves as it were into a moſt ample field, and with a very diffuſe Army they dwell in the Pores and paſſages of the Fibres planted every where about; where alſo being endowed from the blood with new food, they become more lively and more expeditious or ready for the deſigned offices.</p>
                           <p>Here perhaps it may be demanded, how the animal Spirits, diffuſed in ſuch nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous troops through the habit of the Body, are able to be ſupplied by ſo ſtrait chanels of the Nerves? To which we reply, That thoſe which reſide more outwardly do not quickly evaporate, nor are remanded back by Circulation: wherefore when all the Fibres are filled by an influx of the Spirits made by little and little from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, very ſmall ſupplements ſuffice to repair their expence: For neither are thoſe dwelling more outwardly, for that they are repaired by the bloody food, much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, though in frequent action.</p>
                           <p>Hence may be noted the difference between the diſtributions of the blood and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits. That Latex, becauſe it is reduced in a circle, its Veſſels are in the whole paſſage proportionated as to the bulk of the Trunk and the branchings ſent from it, to wit, ſo that the branches of the great Artery, being carried from the Heart, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at the leaſt ſo much of the blood, as the ſhoots reaching forth from them, into all the parts. But becauſe the animal Spirits, being once begotten and carried more outwardly, ſubſiſt longer there, and evaporate very ſlowly and by little and little; therefore the Veſſels carrying them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Nerves, in reſpect of the Fibres re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them, are made much leſſer in proportion; leſt perhaps by too great a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of the animal Spirits, and the too thick gathering of the freſh ones ſtill into the nervous parts, the Army of the Veterans, before inſtructed, ſhould be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo the orders of all being diſturbed, the exerciſes of the animal Function ſhould be performed any how. For indeed when at any time the Spirits are made too ſharp, ſo that being therefore ſtruck as it were with madneſs, they ruſh upon the nervous Syſtem with tumult and impetuoſity; from thence a great unquietneſs and continual throwing about of the Members are wont to be excited, to which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times madneſs and fury ſucceed.</p>
                           <p>In the order and ordination of the animal Spirits, ſuch as was but now deſcribed, the <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> or the Eſſence of the ſenſitive Soul conſiſts, to wit, which is only a certain <hi>Syſtaſis</hi> or ſhadowy ſubſiſtence of thoſe Spirits, which like Atoms or ſubtil Particles, being chained and adhering mutually one to another, are figured together in a certain Species. Moreover, the faculties of the ſame Soul depend upon the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Metatheſis</hi> and geſticulation of thoſe Spirits within the aforeſaid Organs of the Head and nervous Syſtem. But the conſideration of this Soul and its powers requires a peculiar Tract, which hereafter (God willing) we intend; in the mean time, our Method demands of us, that (according to our weak skill) by the cenſe or numbering of the Nerves, being particularly made, we ſhould deliver an exact Neurology or Doctrine of the Nerves.</p>
                           <p>But for that in the premiſed general conſideration of the Nerves and Fibres, there was mention made of the nervous and nutritious Juyce; notwithſtanding what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to their powers and natures, hath been neither fully nor clearly enough deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; therefore we will a little divert here, and make it our buſineſs to inquire what ſort of Juyces and Humors are carried into the parts of the animated body for their nouriſhment, and by what ways or paſſages: then this difficulty being removed, a plain and eaſie way leads into the Doctrine of the Nerves.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> Of the Nervous Liquor, and whether that or the bloody Humor be Nutritious.</head>
                           <p>SInce the Circulation of the Blood was made known, and it hath been plainly made appear, that it did no where ſtagnate and ſtand ſtill long, but was carried in a reciprocal motion, always as in a circle; it began to grow doubtful, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther its <hi>Latex</hi> is nutritious or not. For beſides, that the more rapid courſe of the blood, as of a torrent, might ſeem to wear the banks which it flowed between, and to carry away ſome Particles from them, rather than to be able to affix any thing to them; the ſubſtance it ſelf alſo of the blood, for that it is more torrid and uneven, is thought to be altogether unfit for nutrition. Wherefore that a Juyce may be found more convenient or fit for this office, the paſſages and hidden receſſes of the Nerves are to be viewed; and as a certain Latex is found to flow within their Pores and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, preſently the blood being rejected, that nervous humor is gifted with the title of nutritious: but yet by what right, and after what manner nutrition is performed, ſhall be our preſent purpoſe to inquire.</p>
                           <p>And here firſt of all, that we may take the part of the blood, it will be eaſie to ſhew, that there is matter contained in it fit enough for the nouriſhment of the body, and a ſufficient ſtore of it. For beſides the ſulphureous ſubſtance of the blood, which within the fire-place of the Heart, with a continual inkindling, and by that means deflagration in the Veſſels produces life, and in the more perfect Animals heat, there is found alſo a certain other humor ſoft and alible, which in the Circulation, being diſtributed through ſeveral parts of the Body, by increaſing them adds nouriſhment and bulk: yea the deflagration it ſelf of the blood, plainly as a Kitchin-fire in dreſſing meat, as it were boils and prepares this humor, whereby it more eaſily is aſſimilated into the ſubſtance of every part to be nouriſhed. Hence it comes to paſs, that by reaſon of a defect of heat in the blood, no leſs than of exceſs, nutrition is often hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. But that this kind of alible Juyce is contained in the bloody maſs, the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy</hi> or ſpontaneous <hi>Analyſis</hi> of its <hi>Latex</hi> ſufficiently declares; for the extravaſated blood, when it goes into parts of its own accord, this liquor being disjoyned from the purple thick part, and ſwimming a top of it, appears clear or limpid; but by reaſon of its more thick contents, to wit, the nutritious Particles, like the white of an Egg, it is eaſily made thick, and grows white by a gentle heat: which thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this familiar Experiment, to wit, if you ſhall evaporate a little of it only in a Skillet over the fire, the whole liquor will preſently grow together into a white Gelly. By this liquor, as the blood is more or leſs imbued with it, living Creatures grow and become more fleſhy or lean: for both the blood of younger Animals being looſned from cold, is wont to ſhew much more of this kind of white than more ancient or older Creatures; and we may take notice daily at our Tables, that very much of this kind of Gelly comes out of the fleſh of a Lamb or Calf being boiled or roaſted, and nothing almoſt from Mutton or Beef, eſpecially if old. Therefore we may lawfully ſuppoſe, that the blood is truly nouriſhable; and that the whole, or at leaſt the greateſt part of the matter, for the adding bulk or ſubſtance to every part, is diſpenſed from it: but if at any time it be defective in this its office, that happens not out of the natural unfitneſs of it, but becauſe its diſpoſition is ſometimes depraved, and as the Stomach labouring with ſome vice, rejects or perverts the Chyle to be cooked by it.</p>
                           <p>But the blood, as it is not the only and alone humor, which is diſtributed in the animated Body, ſo neither ſeems it able to perform alone and of it ſelf the whole office of nutrition. For beſides that, being diffuſed through the Arteries and Veins, another Latex is every where diſpenſed from the Head through the Nerves; which ſhall be ſhewn to afford ſomething at leaſt to nouriſhment.</p>
                           <p>As to the firſt, there are many reaſons which declare that kind of humor to be in the Brain and nervous ſtock, and to abound in their whole paſſages. For unleſs the animal Spirits, continually flowing out, ſhould be founded in ſuch a Latex, which is their Vehicle, they would not be contiguous or joyned, nor able to continue and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:152521:173"/>
knit together the <hi>Syſtaſis</hi> of the ſenſitive Soul. For if <hi>Hippocrates</hi> did obſerve long ſince, that Cramps and Convulſive motions were produced from drineſs and emptineſs, that perhaps might happen by this means: to wit, becauſe the humor in the Nerves or Fibres being deficient, the Spirits diſtracted one from another, were ſeparated; which notwithſtanding, that they might ſtill retain their mutual embraces, and as it were folding of hands, bend the containing bodies, and very much contract, and ſo force them into Convulſions. Beſides, Wounds and Impoſtumes of the Tendons and nervous parts ſeem to witneſs the diffuſion of the nervous Juyce, either of which drop forth a thin Ichor, and wholly unlike to the mere bloody Excretion: no leſs may be argued from the Ganglia and Evil running Sores. In time of ſleeping the aforeſaid humor is wont to flow more plentifully into the Brain and Nerves, and to obſtruct their paſſages; and therefore yawnings and ſtretchings come frequently upon thoſe awaking, that its reliques might be ſhook off. Laſtly, we might readily ſhew, that from the depravation of the nervous humor, Melancholy, Madneſs, and ſome wonderful Convulſive diſtempers proceed. But it may be objected, that there is no ſuch kind of humor, becauſe the Nerves being cut aſunder, it is not perceived to flow out; and that the Nerves being alſo bound, they do not ſwell above the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as Arteries and Veins. But it may be anſwered, That the liquor flowing in the nervous ſtock, is very ſubtil and ſpirituous, and which, by any ſtriving or wrinkling up of thoſe parts, when they are roughly handled, may eaſily evaporate and be blown away or diſperſed unperceivably. Then further, 'tis obſerved in the Whelps of ſome Animals newly litter'd, who have as yet that juyce viſcous, and not eaſily to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, and that have their Nerves greater, if they be bound hard together with cords, they will ſwell above the Ligature.</p>
                           <p>Therefore ſeeing it appears, that a certain Humor doth creep through the blind Pipes and paſſages of the Head and of the Appendix, both medullar and nervous, it behoves us next of all to inquire from whence that comes thither, and whither it tends; and laſtly, of what kind of nature and uſe it is. Concerning theſe firſt it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, from what hath been ſaid, that the aforeſaid Latex, ſerving for a Vehicle of the animal Spirits, is perpetually inſtilled, together with them, from the blood wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the exterior confines of the Brain and Cerebel, which from thence, paſſing through the medullar Trunk, is afterwards, with a gentle ſpring, poured through the whole frame of the nervous Syſtem; ſo that the firſt fountains of the nervous humor are in the Brain and Cerebel. But further, to this Juyce conveying the forces of the animal Spirits, and ſupplied only from the Head, there joyns a certain other humor, as it were auxiliar in the whole paſſage, and reſtores and refreſhes it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe about to grow deficient.</p>
                           <p>We think that theſe kind of ſupplements and ſubſidies, which happen to come from elſewhere to the nervous Juyce flowing from the Head, are received and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted inwardly from the ſides and extremities of the medullar and nervous Syſtem. We have already ſhewed that an humor, as it were ſecondary, is inſtilled from the blood watering theſe parts in its whole paſſage; becauſe the Arteries follow not only the medullar Trunk, but alſo the greater Trunks of the Nerves in many places, and inſert into them ſanguiferous ſhoots. Beſides, foraſmuch as the animal Spirits flowing within the nervous ſtock for the performing of ſenſe and motion, tend to and fro, and ſo bear a double aſpect; it is probable alſo, that the liquor watering the Nerves, as it moſt commonly tends forward, ſo ſometimes backward; and ſo that the extremities of the Nerves, implanted in ſome parts, imbibe from them the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, at leaſt ſome Effluvia's, with which they are ſatisfied, and oftentimes transfer them into the Brain it ſelf. Certainly there is no doubt, that the Fibres and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Filaments or threads which cover the Senſory of taſte, and the <hi>Viſcera</hi> ſerving for Concoction, do immediately receive ſome taſtes of the taken in food, from which ſupplies are carried to the Brain it ſelf in great hunger and faintneſs of Spirits. Becauſe if at any time the Spirits inhabiting it, being exhauſted very much with heavy and long labour, begin to fail, a moſt ſwift refection is performed, Pectorals or Cordials being ſcarcely ſwallowed, and long indeed before the alible Juyce can be able to reach to the border of the Brain by the paſſage of the blood. Moreover it is moſt likely, that not only the benign Effluvia's of the aliment are received by the extremities of the Nerves ending about the <hi>Viſcera;</hi> but alſo by this way, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an infeſtous matter, and in a manner malignant, is communicated by the Nerves and their paſſages to the Head. But indeed the preternatural Juyces heaped up about
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:152521:173"/>
the Hypochondria, the Spleen, Womb, and other Bowels emit vaporous little bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which not only infect the bloody maſs, and diſtemper the Head by that means, but they climb to the Brain more immediately by the paſſage of the Nerves, and ſtrike it with an heavy ill. For from hence in part it comes, that Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacks and Hyſterical people are ſo cruelly puniſhed through the Symptoms ſtirred up in the Brain and nervous ſtock for the faults of the lower Bowels; hence it is, that little Pills of Opium, being ſcarcely diſſolved in the Stomach, cauſe a Torpor or heavineſs. But here is no place to diſcourſe more largely of theſe. It behoves us to conſider what remains, the Springs of the nervous Juyce, the Auxiliaries but now detected, and its Virtues and Influences.</p>
                           <p>Concerning the nervous Liquor we ſhall inquire what that doth in its paſſage, to wit, whilſt it flows within the Marrows or middles of the Brain and Cerebel, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullar Trunk and the bodies themſelves of the Nerves: ſecondly, then for what uſes it ſerves, when being ſliden from the ends of the Nerves, it is ſpread abroad on the ſecondary parts of the nervous Syſtem.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, whilſt that of the nervous Liquor paſſes through the Head, and either of its Appendix, its chief office ſeems to be for a Vehicle of the animal Spirits, which indeed it carries along with its diffuſion, and contains them under the ſame <hi>Syſtaſis.</hi> Yea, this Latex ſhews various Schemes of the Spirits for the performing of ſenſe and motion; even as the humid Particles of the Air paſs through the Optick Configurations of the Rays of Light. Alſo moreover, the nutrition of the aforeſaid parts and accretion or growth into a greater bulk, depends in ſome meaſure upon the nervous Juyce watering the ſame, as ſhall be ſhewed by and by.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. But the greateſt queſtion is concerning this Liquor being diffuſed beyond the ends of the Nerves upon the ſecondary parts of the nervous Syſtem, and in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of them on the whole Body; to wit, whether ſuch a Juyce be nouriſhing of all the ſolid parts, or of ſome of them by themſelves, as Authors variouſly think; or to what other office it is deſtinated.</p>
                           <p>Concerning theſe it firſt appears, that the Brain and Nerves, with the Juyce flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of them, contribute matter, or at leaſt ſome influence to the work of nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the which if it ſhould chance to fail (a ſign of which defect is, if the animal Faculty falters in part) the nouriſhment there is wont preſently to be hindred or perverted. This is plainly ſeen in the Palſie, excited from an evident cauſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any previous Dyſcraſie of the blood, where ſuddenly an Atrophy follows the privation of motion or ſenſe, or of both together. Further, in the Scurvy, where the taint hath corrupted the nervous Juyce, when the ſick begin to be afflicted with the Vertigo and ſwimming of the Head, and with wandring pains, Convulſions, and a frequent looſning of the Members, the fleſh falls preſently away, as in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and without any fault of the Lungs, the ſick wither away, as if diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with a Phthiſis. It is a vulgar obſervation, That from the immoderate uſe of <hi>Venus,</hi> alſo from an inveterate Gonorrhoea, from Strumous or running Ulcers, and other Impoſtumes, by which much of the nervous Juyce is waſted, a leanneſs or waſting of the whole Body is produced. Certainly, if I be not deceived, there are ſome Atrophies, yea, and ſorts of breakings out, which ſeem to depend wholly upon the defect or the evil diſpenſation of the nervous Juyce, when the blood, as to its quantity and diſpoſition, is not much in fault. Laſtly, the conſideration of ſome Diſeaſes and Symptoms ſo plainly confirms the diffuſion of the nervous Liquor and its great influence on all the parts, that there is even left no room for doubting.</p>
                           <p>Alſo no leſs doth the curing of ſome Diſeaſes and the uſe of Remedies confirm the ſame. For from hence a reaſon is taken, wherefore Cephalick Plaſters oftentimes yield ſuch ſignal help in the <hi>Phthiſis;</hi> not becauſe they ſtay the <hi>Catarrh</hi> of the Serum falling down on the Lungs, (as the common people think) but becauſe by corroborating the Brain they reſtore the diſpoſition of the nervous Juyce, before vitiated. For this cauſe it is, that ſome diſeaſes being ſtirred up by the fault of the nervous Liquor, of which ſort among others are Cancrous and Strumous Ulcers, or ſuch as come of the Kings-Evil, are hardeſt of all to be cured; becauſe the morbid tincture of the Brain, and of the <hi>Latex</hi> watering it (whether it be innate or acquired) is not eaſily mended: yet ſometimes when the root of the diſeaſe, lurking in the Brain or nervous ſtock, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by the help of Nature it ſelf, or by Chance, by the uſe of ſome remedy; preſently the Symptoms of other parts, though neglected in the whole, vaniſh, not without the ſuſpicion of a miracle. But how much the alteration of the Brain ſerves
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:152521:174"/>
for the curing of ſome moſt grievous diſeaſes, ſome inſtances taken from the Farriers Art will clearly ſhew.</p>
                           <p>For when many Medicines and Methods of Adminiſtrations are wont to be tryed in vain for the curing the ſtinking diſeaſe in Horſes, commonly called the <hi>Farcy</hi> (which <hi>Helmontius</hi> aſſerts to be like the French Pox, and the Author of its Contagion) the moſt certain means of curing (which I have very often known to be applied with good ſucceſs) conſiſts in this; that ſome ſharp Medicines, of which ſort are Hearts-caſe, Water-Pepper, Ranunculus or Crowfoot, and the like, which very much abound in volatile Salt, being bruiſed into a maſs, and put into the Ears of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed Horſe, and kept there for twenty four hours: it is ſcarce credible by what means all the Ulcers are preſently dryed up, and the diſeaſe healed, as it were by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, is quickly profligated in the whole. For ſince this Application is made far from the affected parts, without any alteration of the bowels or the blood, it ſhould be ſo healed at a diſtance; certainly the cauſe of ſuch an Energy muſt only be, that by this kind of Medicine the Dyſcraſie or evil diſpoſition of the Brain and nervous Juyce is taken away, and ſo the firſt root of the ſickneſs being cut off, the ſhoots and fruits preſently wither. It were worth our labour to try ſuch kind of Experiments alſo in our Medicines. Yea it may be well ſuſpected, that ſuch a way ought to be ordered for the common Cure of the Kings-Evil. Among our Country-men, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from our Anceſtors, it is thought that the ſeventh Son, or he that is born the ſeventh one after another in a continued ſeries, can cure this diſeaſe by ſtroking it only with his hand; and truly I have known many, whom no Medicines could help, to have been cured in a ſhort time only by that remedy. Few doubt but that this diſeaſe is wont to be cured often by the Touch of our King. The reaſon of ſuch an effect (if it be merely natural) ought to be aſſigned not to any other thing than that in the ſick (eſpecially thoſe of ripe age) the Phantaſie and ſtrong Faith of the hoped for Cure induces that alteration, or rather ſtrengthning to the Brain, whereby the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid diſpoſition radicated in it is profligated. But I ſhall return from whence I am digreſſed, to inquire what the nervous Juyce contributes to nutrition.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. I ſay therefore ſecondly, although nutrition depends in ſome meaſure upon the influence of the nervous Juyce, yet it is highly improbable, that all the ſeveral parts of the whole Body ſhould be nouriſhed only by this proviſion. For beſides that this were to impoſe upon the Government of the Soul it ſelf, and its primary Organs, the cooking office of nutrition wholly unworthy the excellency and dignity of thoſe parts; it ſeems alſo that the nervous Liquor ſhould be altogether unfit for the adminiſtring to this Province: becauſe when oftentimes immenſe expences are made of the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be aſſimilated into the ſubſtance of the ſolid parts, eſpecially by immoderate ſweat, alſo by continual labour and exerciſe, which Country-men and Labourers daily uſe, it is not poſſible that ſuch loſſes ſhould be repaired only by the nouriſhment ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, or ſent through the ſmall paſſages of the Nerves.</p>
                           <p>When I had long and ſeriouſly conſidered with my ſelf concerning this thing, what I at length thought, I ſhall tell you freely, and without any covering, or making any reflection, or blaming the Opinions of others. It ſeems firſt, that the nouriſhing matter of the whole Body is diſtributed into all parts from the blood through the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries; yet it may lawfully be thought, that the converſion of this matter into nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, and the aſſimilation of it into the ſubſtance of the part to be nouriſhed, is performed by the influence and help of the nervous Juyce, as it were of a certain ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous Ferment. As to the firſt: we have already noted, that the ſanguiferous Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels do not only follow almoſt every where the Muſcles and Bowels, but alſo the Head and its Appendix, yea the Membranes, Bones, and Nerves themſelves, and affix to them all thick ſhoots, as ſo many little chanels, for the receiving the nouriſhment. Moreover, as there is a purple craſſament or thick ſubſtance in the blood, whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſtuffs and nouriſhes the Pores of the Parenchyma of the Muſcles; ſo there is a whitiſh Gelly, by which the Membranes and the whiter parts ſeem to increaſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it may be obſerved, that the blood it ſelf increaſing, contains in it ſelf fibres and ſmall threads, ſuch as are interwoven in the Muſcles and nervous parts; and if the ſame ſtand long in any Veſſel, it is preſently coagulated into longiſh, white, and hard cruſts or bits, whoſe ſubſtance is plainly fleſhy; ſo that the blood produces fleſh of it ſelf, though the ſame be rude and unformed: wherefore the configuration and the apt diſpoſition of the nouriſhing matter, ſupplied from it, depends on the coming and Energy of the nervous Juyce: but after what manner this is done, we ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour now to ſhew.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="135" facs="tcp:152521:174"/>After the web or ſtuff of all the parts is laid, it is required then that they be both drawn forth in due proportion, and grow in ſubſtance, and alſo that the little ſpaces which are left by reaſon of the Effluvia's perpetually falling off, may be continually filled with the nouriſhing ſubſtance caſt in. In theſe two things the buſineſs of nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion chiefly conſiſts; for the performing of either of which the blood affords matter, and reaches it forth (as was ſaid) in the circulating to the ſeveral parts of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, and as it were ſtands at the doors of the part to be nouriſhed: yet, that this matter may be rightly diſpoſed, and its particles, to wit, the thick and thin, ſaline and ſulphureous, and others of a ſeveral nature, ſeparated one from another, may be imployed with ſome choice to the deſtinated uſes, there ſeems need of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain directing faculty, and as it were plaſtick virtue, got ſomewhere elſe than from the blood it ſelf. For indeed the blood being deſtitute of animal Spirits, is unfit for the performing theſe offices. Wherefore, for that it appears there doth lye hid in the nervous ſtock, a certain juyce, and the ſame being gifted with animal Spirit to be diffuſed to all parts, how can we ſuppoſe leſs but that this ſubtil and ſpirituous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, every where meeting with the arterious, which is duller and thicker, actuates and inſpires it, and as it were ordains it for the performing the deſigned work of nutrition? eſpecially when it plainly appears, that by reaſon of the defect or depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of this nervous Juyce, nutrition is always fruſtrated or perverted.</p>
                           <p>Therefore it may be lawful, in the difficult Controverſie concerning the Matter and Method of Cure, to propoſe this our Hypotheſis, though it be a Paradox and very abſtruſe; to wit, that the nervous Juyce (which we have ſaid was like the male ſeed) is poured out with the nutritious humor copiouſly ſuggeſted from the Arteries, as it were the genitive or ſeed of another Sex, every where upon all the parts; and that this former, being indued with active Elements, imbues the more thick matter, as with a certain Ferment, and impregnates it with animal Spirit; and when it ſo makes it, with a mutual entring in or coming together, to be diſſolved and to go into parts, its particles being extricated one from the other (the Spirit infuſed help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) they are put upon bodies of the ſame meaſure with themſelves, and are aſſimilated into their ſubſtances. In the mean time, becauſe the animal Spirits are poured out in great plenty with the nervous Juyce, thoſe which are at leiſure from the work of nutrition, or remain after that is finiſhed, turn aſide every where into the Fibres, as into proper dwelling-houſes, and there being ready for the offices of ſenſe and motion, ſtay; which offices indeed, that thoſe Spirits the Inhabitants of the Fibres, may the better perform, they acquire from the blood watering the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, certain auxiliary forces, wherefore they being endued with a certain elaſtick force, are apt to be highly rarified and as it were exploded.</p>
                           <p>But indeed we ſuppoſe, that as the nervous Liquor, being turgid with animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, cauſes the arterious humor to become nutritious; ſo in compenſation of this the animal Spirits remaining of the work of nutrition, and every where diſpoſed within the Fibres, receive from the arterious blood a mixture or certain Copula; by whoſe help and cooperation the ſame Spirits exert or put forth much more ſtrongly their locomotive force. For it ſeems that little ſulphureous bodies are added to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous-ſaline particles from the watering blood; and ſo when the animal Spirits are furniſhed with this Copula, they being ſtirred up into motion, ſhake off the borrowed particles, which being ſtruck with a certain force, like the exploſion of Gun-powder, ſuddenly intumifie the Muſcles, and ſo by contracting them very much, they cauſe a vehement motive endeavour. We ſhall have an occaſion of diſcourſing more at large of this, when we treat of the Motion of the Muſcles.</p>
                           <p>Yet in the mean time, we ſhall take notice, that the Muſcles of the whole Body, as to their motion, have a certain Analogy with the motion of the Heart. For indeed the animal Spirits in the Heart, flowing within the fibres and nervous threads, (with which this part is much beſet) receive plentifully ſulphureous little bodies from the inflowing blood diſtending the ſides of either boſom, which whilſt the ſame Spirits, being filled to a fulneſs, ſhake off and as it were explode, a <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the whole Heart (its ſides being carried with a certain force inwards) is brought in or cauſed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the blood, from either ſide the boſom, is caſt out as it were by the impulſe of a Spring or Bolt. Truly, unleſs the Spirits inhabiting the Heart, ſhould receive food and matter of exploſion from the blood it ſelf, their ſtock, ſupplied or ſent by the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the few and ſmall Nerves, would not ſuffice for the performing of the undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued motion. A ſign of this is, that from a defect or depravation of the blood,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:152521:175"/>
as well as of the animal Spirits, the motion alſo of the Heart is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>efective or diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And not much unlike in the Muſcles, as in the Heart, is the buſineſs performed; the Spirits inhabiting their Fibres, receive a ſulphureous Copula and apt for explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, from the blood there more plentifully flowing than about the Membranes, with which being endued, as often as they receive from the Nerve as it were the fiery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindling or the match, the inſtinct of the motion to be performed, they being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, and ſtriking of their Copula, very much inflate or blow up the Muſcle, and intumifie it for performing or compaſſing the motive endeavour. Nor is it much to purpoſe, or makes any great difference, that the motion of the Heart, ſtirred up by a perpetual inſtinct, is found always neceſſary; but the Muſcles the moſt of them only occaſionally and at the command of the Animal, do put forth their motive power; for the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and ſome Muſcles, dedicated to Reſpiration, are urged with a perpetual <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> as well as the Heart it ſelf.</p>
                           <p>From the aforeſaid Hypotheſis concerning the offices and uſes of the nervous and arterious Juyce, Arguments that otherwiſe determine the work of Nutrition, may be eaſily anſwered. For that the blood is ſaid rather to prey upon the ſolid parts than to repleniſh them, that ought to be attributed to the Diſeaſe and Dyſcraſie of it, and not to it ſimply: becauſe ſometimes the blood is accuſed, for that it too much ſtuffs the ſolid parts; to wit, foraſmuch as its maſs being wateriſh and weak, it lays aſide the alible Juyce (which not being truly cook'd, is ſtill crude and vicious) with very great plenty about the habit of the Body, and ſo induces an <hi>Anaſarca.</hi> In the mean time it ought to be granted, That as it is the blood that is evil which heaps up too much vicious nutriment; ſo it is the ſame, which being well and right, doth lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly perform the office of Nutrition.</p>
                           <p>But that it is argued, That the nervous is rather the nouriſhing Juyce, becauſe by reaſon of its defect, depravation or too prodigal expence, the acts of nutrition are wont to be hindred or perverted; it is eaſie to reply to this, That the impediments of the nervous Juyce, being made vicious, reſpect the form of nouriſhment, and not the matter of it: to wit, it ſometimes happens, that the blood diſpenſes the alible matter in due plenty and diſpoſition; which notwithſtanding, by the fault of the nervous Juyce, is not rightly aſſimilated. When an impotency of motion comes upon a too great diſtenſion of the Muſcle or Tendon with pain, ſhortly nutrition being hindred, a Jelly grows about the diſtempered part: which notwithſtanding drops not out of the Nerve (as is commonly ſaid) but the glutinous humor being poured out of the Arteries for aliment, for that it cannot be received by the hurt part, is gathered together there: nor is it to be thought, that Tumors, or Strumous Ulcers or the running Sores of the Evil do contain or pour out only a nervous humor, ſince the matter of either is for the moſt part bloody, which by reaſon of the evil Ferment of the nervous Juyce, puts on a ſtrange form, and that diverſly degenerous.</p>
                           <p>This ſuppoſition of the twofold Humor, for the matter and form of nouriſhment, is taken to be of egregious uſe for the ſolving of the moſt difficult Phaenomena, which are met with about the Diſtempers of the Brain and nervous Juyce: yea, that Patho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, ſeriouſly conſidered, ſeems to infer as a certain neceſſary conſequence, that a twofold Juyce is neceſſary for the work of Nutrition; as ſome other time perhaps we may ſhew. In the mean time, leaving this Speculation, we ſhall proceed to the remaining Task of our <hi>Anatomy,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Neurologie</hi> or of the Nerves in particular.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> The firſt four Pair of Nerves ariſing within the Skull are deſcribed.</head>
                           <p>THE diviſion or diſtinction of the Nerves, by reaſon of their various reſpects, is wont to be manifold: to wit, as they are either ſoft or hard, ſingular or numerous in their beginnings; or that they ſerve either to the faculty of Senſe, or Motion, or to both together. But they are commonly diſtinguiſhed, That ſome Nerves ariſing within the Skull, proceed from the oblong Marrow; and others going out of the joynts of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> are derived from the ſpinal Marrow. But beſides theſe, another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of differencing them ſeems beſt to us; to wit, That ſome Nerves, as it were Clients and Servants of the Brain, perform only ſpontaneous Acts, and others, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Servants of the Cerebel, are imployed only about the exerciſes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary Function. There will be no need to aſſign different Eſſences or Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Nerves according to theſe ſeveral differences: but rather that there be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted a particular Cenſe or Muſter of them, and following the order of Nature, that we eſpecially unfold every one of them in the ſeries in which they are diſpoſed in the animal Body.</p>
                           <p>Among the Nerves ariſing from the Skull, the ſmelling Nerves, or thoſe which are commonly called the Mammillary Proceſſes, lead the way; for that they have their riſe before all the reſt, and are ſtretched out forward beyond the Brain it ſelf. Theſe Nerves go out of the ſhanks of the oblong Marrow within the chamfered bodies and chambers of the Optick Nerves; and being endued with a manifeſt cavity, open into the firſt Ventricle of the Brain on either ſide behind the ſame chamfered bodies; ſo that the humidity flowing between the folding of the Brain, is carried through theſe chanels into the mammillary Proceſſes; whether they go farther forward, ſhall be anon inquired into: Becauſe theſe Nerves being broad and large, ariſing near the chamfered bodies, and from thence ſtretched forward under the Baſis of the Brain, their bulk is increaſed by degrees till they go into the round Proceſſes like Paps, by which either boſom of the Cribrous or Sieve-like Bone is beſmeared. Within the Socket of this Bone theſe Nerves, as yet ſoft and tender, obtain Coats of the <hi>Dura Mater;</hi> with which being divided into many fibres and filaments, and paſſing through the holes of the Sieve-like Bone, they go out of the Skull: from whence being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated or carried forward into the caverns of the Noſtrils, and diſtributed on every ſide, they are inſerted into the Membrane beſpreading thoſe Labyrinths.</p>
                           <p>If we inquire into the nature and uſe of theſe parts, without doubt the mammillary
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:152521:176"/>
Proceſſes and their medullar roots, with the fibres and ſmall threads hanging to the ſame, are truly Nerves, and ſerve properly for the very Organ of the Smell. Seeing theſe conduce to the ſenſe only without any local motion, therefore (even as the other hearing Nerve) whilſt they are within the Skull, they are plainly medullar and ſoft; whereby the animal Spirits more eaſily moved within the more tender ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Nerves, might convey more readily and accurately to the common Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory the Ideas or forms of the ſenſible Species: But becauſe the effluvia's or odorous breaths to be received by the naked Organ, carry oftentimes with them ſharp and pricking Particles hurtful to the Brain and Nerves; therefore in the firſt courſe theſe Nerves being about to go out of the Skull, borrow Coats from the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> which ſerve for Armour. Further, as theſe breaths (leſt they ſhould ſtrike more ſharply by ruſhing impetuouſly on the Senſory) being admitted only by little and little, and by ſmall bands, ought to be brought through divers narrow turnings and windings of the Noſtrils; therefore that theſe Nerves may the better receive the effluvia's flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the ſeveral dens, they are ſo divided into very many fibres and ſmall threads or filaments, that there may be no paſſage of the Noſtrils to which at leaſt ſome of them are not deſtinated. And after this manner, although the exhalations, as it were torn into little Clouds, are received by the nervous filaments, and ſo care is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, that they being more thickly elevated, may not overwhelm or obſcure the Senſory; yet leſt any thing ſharp and troubleſom ſhould be carried with them to the Brain, the cribrous bone is ſet before the doors as an obſtacle, through whoſe little holes being ſtrained, they may put off all ſharpneſs. And laſtly, they being carried through the ſofter Nerve, as it were another Medium, and ſo broken again, they at length being ſoft and gentle enough, are ſtaid at the firſt Senſory.</p>
                           <p>But that theſe Nerves are noted through the whole with an open hollowneſs within the Skull, the reaſon ſeems to be, that the watry humor ſtilling out of the foldings of the Brain, and being derived into thoſe chanels, might beat back and temper the impreſſions of the odours, when too ſharp and fiery: for as the humors included in the Eye, variouſly refract the viſible Species, whereby it paſſing at laſt through the Optick Nerve without any force, ſlides pleaſantly to the common Senſory; ſo it is not improbable, that the water contained within theſe paſſages of the Nerves, does in like manner ſweeten the ſpecies of the odours, and prepare them in ſome meaſure for the Senſory. Wherefore it is obſerved, that Cattle and Beaſts which are fed with herbage, have the mammillary Proceſſes exceeding large and always full of water; to wit, leſt the odours of the herbs continually attracted by them (unleſs their force ſhould be blunted after the aforeſaid manner) might hurt or overthrow their more weak brain. Beſides, it is very likely that this watry juyce falling down from the infolding of the Brain, doth not only flow into the open chanels of the Nerves and the mammillary Proceſſes, but alſo doth paſs through by the paſſage of the fibres and filaments the holes of the Sieve-like Bone, and doth wet and continually moiſten the cavities of the Noſtrils, apt to be dryed or torrified too much by the Air thither at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and by the breath continually blown out. For it clearly appears, as we have elſewhere ſhewn, that the ſerous humors creep through the blind paſſages of the Nerves and Fibres, and by them wander from place to place. Yea it may be thought, that not only water, ſufficient for the watering the Noſtrils, doth by this way ſweat through; but alſo whenſoever the ſerous heap is gathered together in the Ventricles of the Brain, its ſuperfluities or the excrementitious humor doth very often paſs through the cribrous Bone by the paſſage of the Fibres, and is ſent out. But we have in another place diſcourſed more largely of this.</p>
                           <p>The ſmelling Nerves, which have within the Skull their mammillary Proceſſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on them, are much greater in an Ox, Goat, and in Cattle, and ſuch like beaſts that live on herbage, than in fleſh-eating Animals; to wit, becauſe in thoſe there ſeems to be more need of the ſenſe of ſmelling to be more exquiſite for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the virtues of the manifold herbs. Alſo theſe Nerves are larger in all Brutes than in Man: the reaſon of which is, becauſe they diſcern things only by the ſenſe, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially their food by the ſmell; but Man learns many things by education or nurture and diſcourſe, and is rather led by the taſte and ſight, than by the ſmell in chuſing his aliments. Theſe Nerves in Birds, as alſo in Fiſhes, are conſpicuous enough; for either of theſe, even as four-footed beaſts, ſeek out and chuſe their food by the help or knowledge of the ſmell.</p>
                           <p>As to the Fibres and Filaments or little ſtrings ſtretching out from the more ſoft
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:152521:176"/>
Nerves through the holes of the Sieve-like Bone into the caverns of the Noſe, theſe are found in all Creatures who have the mammillary Proceſſes: ſo that it is not to be doubted, but that theſe Proceſſes, with this Appendix and its medullary origine, is the Organ of the Smell. And what more confirms this thing, theſe filaments or little ſtrings are far more, and more remarkable in hunting Hounds than in any other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal whatſoever. But beſides theſe Nervulets drawn through the holes of the Sieve-like Bone into the Noſtrils, two branches alſo are ſent hither from the fifth pair, and diſtributed into both the Noſtrils. The reaſon of this ſeems to be, becauſe though the Nerves but now deſcribed, or of the firſt Conjugation, are properly ſmelling Nerves, and effect by themſelves the ſenſe of Smelling; yet theſe are aſſiſted or joyned with other Nerves, alſo by thoſe ſent from the fifth pair, becauſe the Organ of the Smell ought to have a conſent with all other parts, which thoſe ſubſidiary Nerves, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the manifold branching out of the fifth pair, are wont to perform. It chiefly appears, that there is a certain nearneſs or ſtrict affinity between the taſte and the ſmell: and the cauſe of this conſiſts, in that out of the ſame Trunk of the fifth pair certain Nerves are ſent to the Palate, and others to the Noſtrils. Concerning the reaſon of that wonderful conſent which the Noſtrils have with the <hi>Praecordia</hi> in ſneez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, alſo wherefore that light titillation ſtirs up a Cough, ſhall be ſpoken of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when we come to unfold the fifth pair and the intercoſtal Nerves. But in the mean time we ſhall take notice, that although many Nerves belong to the Organ of Smelling, yet that ſenſe is properly performed by the Fibres interwoven in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Coat of the Noſtrils: for thoſe Fibres being ſtruck by the ſenſible object, move and contract themſelves variouſly according to the Idea of the impreſſion; which Affection of them being carried by the paſſage of the Nerves to the Head, foraſmuch as it is there ſtaid by the common Senſory, cauſes the perception of the ſenſe. Thoſe ſenſible Fibres are diverſly figured in ſeveral Animals; which is the reaſon, why odorous things do not alike affect all Animals. For what things by a mans noſtrils, as endued with too ſharp and pricking Effluvia's, are eſteemed highly naught and ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as eſpecially are dung and putrid fleſh; the ſame are to Dogs, whoſe Organ of Smelling is made or conſiſts of more robuſt or ſtrong Fibres, and proportionate to thoſe Effluvia's, as very grateful and choſen for food.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond Conjugation are the Optick or ſeeing Nerves: concerning which we have ſhewn already, in the Anatomy of the Brain, after what manner they ariſe from behind the chamfered bodies out of the ſecond ſection of the medullar ſhanks (which <hi>Galen</hi> calls the <hi>Chamber</hi> of the Optick Nerve) and deſcending from thence with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain compaſs are united, and being again ſeparated and carried into the Ball of the Eyes, conſtitute with diffuſed Fibres the hard Coat. Moreover, in thoſe Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we did but now take notice, that the Trunk of this Nerve growing a little hard without the Skull, was as it were a little bundle of very many Fibres or ſmall ſtrings growing together into one, and of produced Parallels, as it ſhould ſeem for that end, that the animal Spirits, flowing in the whole Nerve, might be moved in ſo many lines or direct rays; to wit, whereby they may carry the viſible Species, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently refracted in the Eye, thence to the common Senſory by a direct beam, and not intorted or rolled about.</p>
                           <p>As often as in the diſtempers of the Eyes blackiſh pricks or concatenated pieces of any thing ſeem to be rolled before the Eyes, it is likely that this apparition is ſo made, becauſe certain filaments or ſmall ſtrings of the Optick Nerve are ſhut up, which when the light cannot paſs through rightly, as through the reſt, ſo many as it were ſhadowy ſpaces appear in the middle of the clearneſs. Theſe Nerves, becauſe they only ſerve for the ſenſe, are therefore more ſoft within the Skull: but becauſe there may be need perhaps, that the Trunk of this Nerve ought to be ſometimes dilated or ſpread abroad, ſometimes bound cloſe together or contracted according to the divers appearance and incourſe of the objects; therefore very many Fibres, being ſent out from the motory or moving Nerves of the Eyes, do every where compaſs and bind it about, and entring with it into the Ball of the Eye, are inſerted partly near the root of the Optick Nerve, and partly penetrate more deeply the Sclerotick or hard Coat it ſelf.</p>
                           <p>Further, the Optick Nerves are not only bound or environed with nervous Fibres ſent from the third pair, but (as we have ſhewn above) with ſanguiferous Veſſels in their whole proceſs. The office of which certainly is, both that there might be every where about the greater Trunk of this Nerve as it were a continual heat or ſufficient
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:152521:177"/>
fire-place; alſo perhaps, that the food of the bloody humor might be ſupplied to the Spirits, living there within the trunks of the nerves, far from the fountain, as is wont to be in other places.</p>
                           <p>Concerning the Fabrick of the Eye it ſelf, and manner of ſeeing, alſo concerning the whole dioptrick proviſion, here ſeems a fit opportunity of diſcourſing: but this were to digreſs too far from our purpoſe, to wit, the mere or naked Doctrine of the Nerves; and I may the better paſs by this addition, becauſe this Province hath been ſufficiently and accurately adorned by others. In the mean time we ſhall take notice, that as in the ſmelling, ſo alſo in ſeeing, the ſenſe is performed, not ſo much by the help of the nerve, as of the fibres, which are interwoven with the organ: to wit, the little fibres in the Membranes of the Eyes, and eſpecially thoſe inſerted into the Sclerotick Coat, and diſpoſed after the manner of a net, do receive the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the viſible Species, and by repreſenting the image of the thing, ſo as it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered without, cauſes ſight. But it is the office of the nerve it ſelf to tranſmit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, as it were by the paſſage of the Optick Pipe, that image or ſenſible Species, and to carry it to the common Senſory.</p>
                           <p>The third Conjugation of Nerves are the moving nerves of the Eyes, which ariſe in the Baſis of the medullar Stem behind the Tunnel; from whence going forwards nigh the pair of ſeeing nerves, and going out of the Skull with the other nerves deſtinated to the Eye, they are carried towards the Globe of the Eye; where, being preſently divided into many branches, they provide it with moving Muſcles; but with various difference in divers living Creatures. For in an Ox, who hath got a larger eye, the moving nerve of the eye imparts a branch to every one of the ſix common Muſcles; and beſides, from the nerves of the fourth, fifth, and ſixth pair certain branches are diſtributed to ſome of the ſame Muſcles: ſo that, as often as any Animal intends or applies the ſenſe for the perceiving of this or that object, theſe nerves turn about the Eye, and compoſe it at their pleaſure for the ſpontaneous beholding of the ſame. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides we take notice, that the Eyes do get a diverſe kind of involuntary motion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in Fear, Shame, Anger, Sadneſs, yea and in all Affections of the Head and Heart, whether we will or no, the Eyes are reſpectively figured. Wherefore 'tis highly probable, that theſe kind of pathetick motions of the Eyes, whereof the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creature is ſcarce knowing, are performed by the help of the other nerves, to wit, of thoſe coming from the fourth, fifth, and ſixth pair: and that more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appears, becauſe the ſame nerves which lend their branches to the Eye, take their origines from the Cerebel, the office of which we have often ſhewn to be, to diſpenſe the Spirits for the exerciſe of the involuntary Function.</p>
                           <p>But concerning theſe Nerves of the third pair, which are properly called the Moving nerves of the Eyes, we obſerve, that in Man, a Dog, and in ſome other living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they are found to be ſomewhat otherwiſe than in an Ox: for either nerve in theſe, as in the reſt, is carried out of the Skull, divided into four branches, three of which are carried from thence into three ſtraight diſtinct Muſcles, to wit, one lifting up, the other bringing together, the third preſſing cloſe the Eye; the other branch of it goes forwards further with a ſingle trunk, and is implanted in the middle of the Muſcle going about the Eye, turning obliquely to the inward corner down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. From theſe it appears, that theſe Muſcles, to which this nerve belongs in all, are ſufficient almoſt of themſelves to perform moſt ſpontaneous motions of the Eye: but where the aforeſaid nerve is divided into four ſhoots, it conſtitutes a ſmall and round infolding, out of which many ſmall ſhoots creep through, and variouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs about the trunk of the Optick nerve; for what uſe it is ſo made, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready intimated.</p>
                           <p>The fourth Conjugation of Nerves (which we call rightly the Fourth by order and ſucceſſion, although it is accounted the eighth and laſt by <hi>Fallopius</hi>) hath a diverſe ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine from all the reſt. For whereas moſt of the others proceed from the foot or ſides of the oblong Marrow, this hath its root in the top of it behind the round Protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, called <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Teſtes:</hi> From whence, bending more forward nigh the ſides of the oblong Marrow, it is preſently hid under the <hi>Dura Mater;</hi> under which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along for ſome ſpace, and paſſing through the Skull at the ſame hole with the reſt deſtinated to the Eye, it is beſtowed with a ſingle trunk, not communicating with any of the other nerves, wholly on the Muſcle called the <hi>Trochlear</hi> Muſcle. Above we called theſe nerves the <hi>Pathetick</hi> nerves of the Eyes: for although ſome beſides may deſerve this name, (as ſhall be ſhewn by and by) yet 'tis moſt likely, that the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:152521:177"/>
proper office of theſe is to move the Eyes pathetically, according to the force of the Paſſions and inſtinct of Nature, delivered and remanded from the Brain to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, and ſo on the contrary, from this to that through the <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Teſtes,</hi> and their medullar Proceſſes. For, as we have ſhewn, that by the diverſe impulſe and waving of the animal Spirits dwelling in this by-path, there are inſtituted certain mutual commerces between the Brain and the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> (the Cerebel mediating between either) it will be of neceſſity, that theſe nerves, rooted in the middle way, ſhould be ſtruck by every tending downwards or remove of the Spirits, going this way or that way, and ſo the motions of the Eyes to follow the affections of thoſe parts. All perfect Animals are furniſhed with theſe nerves; and in truth, as none of them but are obnoxious to Anger, Love, Hatred, and other Affections, ſo every little Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhew theſe by the mere aſpect and by the geſture it ſelf of the Eyes. We ſee ſometimes the greater Pike gaping for his prey firſt of all to roll about his eyes, and to look four; then with a ſwift ſhooting out of his body to invade the leſſer fry of fiſh.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> The fifth, ſixth, and ſeventh Pair of Nerves are unfolded.</head>
                           <p>OF the aforeſaid four Pair of Nerves, the two former ſeem chiefly to ſerve for the Senſe only, but the two latter for Motion; and every ſingle nerve of them deſtinated to a peculiar Province: but this which follows next, to wit, the fifth Conjugation of Nerves ſerves for the exerciſe of either Faculty, to wit, both of Senſe and Motion; nor is its Province ſo ſtrictly bounded, that it ſhould belong only to one member, for it is diſtributed to the Eyes, Noſe, and Palate, and the reſt of the parts of the Face; and beſides, helps in its part in ſome ſort the offices and actions of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and almoſt of all the <hi>Viſcera.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This pair (which by the Ancients was accounted the third, by us the fifth pair, and that by right of order or poſition) below the former nerves, proceeds with a broad and large trunk from the ſides of the annular Protuberance or Proceſs ſent out from the Cerebel. It conſiſts of very many Fibres gathered together, ſome of which are ſoft, others hard; ſo that the great trunk of it near its beginning, is nothing elſe than a little bundle of very many nerves, ſome of which are beſtowed on theſe parts, and others on other parts, and in ſome they perform the offices of motion, in others of ſenſe. But that ſo many nerves being deſtinated to ſo many ſeveral members, and remote one from another, yet ariſing together, are collected as it were into one bundle, the reaſon is, that in all the parts to which thoſe nerves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, a certain Sympathy and conſent of actions might be conſerved: to wit, the communion of thoſe nerves is the cauſe why the ſight and ſmell move ſpittle and pleaſe the Palate; nor by any other means are the <hi>Praecordia</hi> affected, according to the various conceptions of the Brain, and tranſmit their affections <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>o he ſeveral parts of the Face; from whence the aſpect or countenance of the whole Animal is pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically figured, as ſhall be ſhewed more particularly below.</p>
                           <p>In the mean time, let us deliver a ſhort Hypotype or figure of this Nerve; its trunk going out of the ſides of the greater Ring, ſometimes near its beginning, but oftner the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> being firſt perforated or paſſed through, is divided into two noted branches. The firſt of theſe tending ſtraight downward, going out of the Skull at a proper hole, in its deſcent towards the lower Jaw, (to whoſe parts it is chiefly deſtinated) is divided into more branches, with which it furniſhes the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-muſcle, alſo the Muſcles of the Face and Cheeks. Moreover from them ſhoots and branches are diſtributed into the Lips, Gums, roots of the Teeth, Jaws, Throat, the farther end of the Palate, yea and the Tongue; for this reaſon chiefly, that the nerves going out of the lower branch of the fifth pair, might effect, beſides ſenſe, the divers offices of Taſte and Touch or Feeling, and motions of a various kind in the aforeſaid members and parts; moſt of which, as the chewing of the aliment, alſo thoſe which have reſpect to configuration or framing of the mouth and face in laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or weeping (as we have already noted) are performed unknown to the Brain, that is involuntarily, and by the help of the Cerebel only, from which theſe Nerves are derived.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="142" facs="tcp:152521:178"/>The other ſuperior, and alſo the greater branch of the fifth pair under the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> nigh the ſide of the Turkey Chair goes ſtraight forward for a little ſpace, and is inlarged into ſome ſhoots over againſt the pituitary Glandula to the trunk of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotick Artery or the wonderful Net, (where it is preſent) then it is inoculated into the nerve of the ſixth pair, and from thence ſends back ſometimes one, ſometimes two ſhoots; which being united with another ſhoot, turned back from the nerve of the ſixth pair, conſtitute the root or firſt trunk of the intercoſtal Nerve. Concerning this intercoſtal nerve, which is made of the lower ramification or branching out of the nerves of the fifth and ſixth pair, it ſhall be ſpoken of particularly hereafter.</p>
                           <p>Preſently after the branches or ſhoots reflected or bent back for the root of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercoſtal nerve, that greater nerve of the fifth pair is divided into two noted branches. The leſſer and uppermoſt of theſe tending towards the globe of the Eye, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again twofold, ſends forth two branches from it ſelf; one of which turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the inward ſide of the Bone, containing the ball or angle of the Eye, is divided into two ſhoots. The other of theſe having paſſed through the Bone nigh the mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millary Proceſſes, is carried into the noſtrils: the office of this nerve is to keep a Sympathy and conſent of action between the noſtrils and ſome other parts: but the other branch of this diviſion is beſtowed on the Muſcle by which Brutes wink.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond Ophthalmick branch of the fifth pair is divided into four or five ſhoots, all which going forward above the Muſcles of the Eye, and in ſome part paſſing through its Glandula's, are almoſt all loſt in the Eye-brows, unleſs that in the paſſage they ſend down two ſmall ſhoots which enter the <hi>Sclerotick</hi> Coat a little below the Tendons of the Muſcles, and reach to the <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> or the fourth thin Membrane that cloaths the Optick nerve; yea and alſo ſend in the paſſage ſmall ſhoots to the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula's of the Eye. It ſeems that theſe nerves of the fifth pair, being diſtributed into the Glandula's of the Eyes and Eye-brows, ſerve chiefly to the involuntary and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick actions of thoſe parts; the chief of which are, the languiſhing and mournful aſpect of the Eyes in weeping, and the unwilling pouring out of tears. For as the lower branching of the fifth pair, to wit, the intercoſtal nerve, provideth in man for the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> it eaſily happens, that from the ſad affection of theſe, the Cardiack branches of this nerve being forced and wrinkled into Convulſions, the aforeſaid Oph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalmick branches alſo ſo correſpond, and by wrinkling the Eye-brows, and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the Glandula's, produce thoſe kind of looks of the Eyes, and marks of ſorrow and grief. Further it is obſerved, that from the Ophthalmick branch of the fifth pair a certain ſhoot is ſent back higher nigh the heads of the Muſcles; which when it has paſſed through at a proper hole, the Bone containing the ball of the Eye, is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſtraight into the caverns of the Noſtrils. Hence, as I think, a reaſon may be given, wherefore paſſing out of a dark place into the light, at the firſt beholding of the Sun, preſently whether we will or no we ſhall ſneez; to wit, the eyes being too ſtrongly ſtruck by the object, and being ſuddenly and diſorderly moved, that they might turn themſelves aſide, the ſame affection is immediately communicated through the aforeſaid Nerve to the Membrane covering the hollow caverns of the Noſtrils, which being thence contracted and wrinkled, (as it is wont by ſome ſharp thing pulling it) provokes ſneezing.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond or greater branch of the ſecond diviſion of the Nerve of the fifth pair being carried nigh the ball of the Eye, is again divided into two branches. The lower of theſe being bent downwards, cleaving into many ſhoots, is beſtowed on the Palate and upper region of the Jaws: The other and higher branch of this ſecond diviſion ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond the ball of the Eye, paſſes through, together with the Vein and Artery, a proper hole made in the bone of the upper Jaw; which Veſſels this Nerve climbs and variouſly compaſſes about with many ſhoots ſent forth; then ariſing out of the bone, it imparts little branches to the Muſcles of the Cheeks, Lips, Noſe, and to the roots of the upper Teeth. Therefore foraſmuch as this Nerve embraces and binds about the ſanguiferous Veſſels deſtinated to the Cheeks and the other parts of the Face; from hence a reaſon may be given, why the face is covered with bluſhing by ſhame: for the animal Spirits being diſturbed by the imagination of an unſeemly thing, by and by endeavouring as it were to hide the face, their irregularities enter this Nerve, ſo that the ſhoots of the ſame Nerve embracing the blood-carrying Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, by compreſſing and pulling the ſame, cauſe the blood to be more forced into the Cheeks and Face, and the Veins being bound hard to be there for ſome time ſtaid and detained. But foraſmuch as many ſhoots and fibres of the ſame maxillar Nerve, derived
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:152521:178"/>
from the fifth pair, interweave themſelves with the fleſh and skin of the Lips, hence the reaſon is plain, why theſe parts are ſo very ſenſible, and beſides, why the mutual kiſſes of Lovers, impreſſed on the Lips, ſo eaſily irritate love and luſt by affecting both the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and Genitals; to wit, becauſe the lower branching of the ſame fifth pair actuates theſe parts conſtituted in the middle and lower Belly, and draws them into the like affection with the Lips. The ſame reaſon holds of Love preſently admitted by the eyes, that as the Poet ſays,

                                 <l>As ſoon as <hi>Mars</hi> ſaw her, he deſir'd her.</l>
                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p>We have but now intimated, that many ſhoots of this Nerve were deſtinated for the buſineſs of chewing; and therefore, becauſe the aliments to be taken ought to undergo not only the examination of the taſte, but alſo of the ſmell and ſight, from the ſame Nerve, whoſe branches being ſent to the Palate and Jaws, perform the buſineſs of chewing, other ſhoots, as it were fore-runners, are carried to the Noſtrils and Eyes, to wit, that theſe Organs of the other Senſes might be furniſhed with ſome helps of probation alſo, for the better knowing or diſtinguiſhing the objects of taſte. Certainly from the nearneſs of kindred and manifold affinity of this Nerve, being alſo much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed in the Head, the mutual dependencies and confederations of very many of its parts, proceed. But how this Nerve in other Provinces, to wit, in the <hi>Thorax</hi> and lower belly, and there about the motions and ſenſions of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> doth cauſe various Sympathies of them among themſelves and with other parts, ſhall afterwards be more largely ſhewn, when we ſhall ſpeak particularly of the intercoſtal Nerve, which is rooted in this nerve of the fifth pair; where, from the manifold communication of this nerve, may be eaſily drawn the reaſons of ſneezing, yawning, laughing, crying, and of other actions merely natural. In the mean time, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior branching of the nerve of the fifth pair ſhews it ſelf after this manner in the Head, and almoſt after the ſame manner is divaricated in moſt living Creatures; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept however, that in ſome, preſently after its riſe, it is divided into three great branches; one of which is deſtinated to the lower Jaw, the other to the Eye and Noſe, and the third to the Cheek.</p>
                           <p>The Nerve of the ſixth Conjugation follows, which ariſing out of the loweſt foot of the annular Protuberance, and being hid under the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> preſently goes out of the Skull at the ſame hole with the nerves of the third and fourth pair, and is carried with a ſingle trunk into the ball of the Eye; but ſo, that near the ſide of the Turkey Chair it is inoculated with the ſecond branch, or the greater of the fifth pair; from whence it turns back, ſometimes one little branch, ſometimes two; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing united with the branches of the fifth pair running back, conſtitute the beginning of the intercoſtal nerve. Then this nerve going forwards, is divided into two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches near the ball of the Eye; one of which is inſerted into the Muſcle drawing back the Eye planted in its outward angle; and the other being torn into various fibres, is beſtowed on the ſeventh Muſcle proper to Brutes; ſo that this nerve alſo ſeems to ſerve to thoſe motions of the Eye that are almoſt only pathetick, or excited by natural Inſtinct. For, as to the uſe of the former ſhoot, it plainly appears, that it is innate to every Animal in a ſudden fear to draw the eyes backward, and to look for what is to be feared on either ſide and behind: then as to its other ſhoot, whereby Brutes wink or twinkle the eye, it is obvious that this ſame motion is ſudden and extemporary, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any previous intention, whereby the eye endeavours to ſhun the injuries of outward things that occur.</p>
                           <p>The ſeventh Conjugation of Nerves, accounted for the fifth by the Ancients, is imployed about the ſenſe of hearing. Of this pair commonly are noted two Proceſſes, the one ſoft, the other hard; which indeed ſeem to be two diſtinct nerves, for that although they have their beginnings nigh one another, yet are ſomewhat diſtinct, and are carried to divers Organs; in the mean time, either agreeing in a certain common reſpect of uſe or action. For whilſt one nerve performs the act of hearing, the other ſupplies ſome requiſites whereby that act may be the better performed: wherefore we ſhall not much ſtrive againſt the common deſcription of this pair, by which it is taken for one. The proceſs of this pair, or the auditory nerve properly, which is called the ſoft Branch, ſeems to ariſe in man out of the lower ſide of the ringy Protuberance, and in beaſts out of the midſt of the leſſer Ring. In ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections I plainly found, that this ſofter nerve, having its beginning lower, ſeemed
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:152521:179"/>
to aſcend a little before it went out of the medullar ſtock; and the other more hard nerve ſeeming to ariſe higher (<hi>viz.</hi> out of the medullar whitiſh line leading about the bottom of the fourth Ventricle) did deſcend a little, and aroſe near the meeting with the other. This ſofter nerve is carried into the paſſage of the ſtony Bone, where entring into the den deſtinated for the receiving the ſound, which is on this ſide the Snail-like winding and the Drum, it ſo infolds it ſelf into the moſt thin Membrane wherewith that den is covered, that as often as the Air implanted in that cavern is moved by the ſtroke of the external Air made upon the Drum, this impreſſion ſtriking this Membrane, and ſtirring up as it were an undulation of the animal Spirits, is forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with carried towards the common Senſory by the paſſage of the nerve there implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There will be a more opportune place of diſcourſing, after what manner, and by what ſort of Organs Hearing is performed, when we ſhall ſpeak of the Senſes.</p>
                           <p>The other Nerve of this pair, or the more hard proceſs, which conduces rather to motion than ſenſe, paſſing through the ſtony Bone at an hole proper to it ſelf, ariſes near the auditory paſſage, where it preſently receives into its trunk a branch from the wandring pair brought thither; then immediately after that joyning together or coalition, it is divided into two branches: The firſt of theſe tending downwards, is beſtowed upon the Muſcles of the Tongue and the Bone <hi>Hyoides;</hi> the other going about the auditory paſſage, and bending more upwards, is divided into three ſhoots; the firſt of which, anſwering to the nerve of the former diviſion, beſtows ſome ſhoots on the Muſcles of the Lips, Mouth, Face, and Noſtrils, and ſo actuates ſome exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Organs for the forming the voice, as the former doth ſome interior Organs. The ſecond ſhoot of this diviſion diſtributes its ſhoots into the Muſcles of the Eye-brows and Forehead; and the third into the Muſcles of the Ear it ſelf. The offices and uſes of all theſe have been already ſhewn, the ſumm of which is, that as often as the ſound is admitted in, eſpecially if it be any ways unuſual, new, or to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, preſently by a certain natural inſtinct the Ears and Eyes erect and open themſelves: to wit, for that end ſhoots from this nerve are inſerted into the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Eye-lids and Ears, that by the paſſage of theſe, the Spirits inhabiting ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Region, might be called out as it were to watch. For a like reaſon ſhoots from the ſame hard proceſs of this nerve are diſtributed both into the Muſcles of the Tongue and of the Bone <hi>Hyoides;</hi> as alſo into thoſe of the Lips and the outward parts of the Mouth, that by their paſſage, the ſound being tranſmitted further to theſe Organs of the voice, it being equal or like the ſame, might officiouſly anſwer it as were an <hi>Echo.</hi> That the deſcriptions of the aforeſaid nerves might be better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, I have thought good here to repreſent in the following Figure the branchings of the fifth and ſixth pair. The ſeventh pair is fitly delineated in the ninth Figure.</p>

                           <head>CHAP. XXIII. <hi>The Deſcription of the eighth Pair of Nerves.</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>THE Conjugation of the Nerves of the eighth pair, accounted by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients for the ſixth, is called the Wandring pair; to wit, for that its Nerve, not content with one member or region of the Body, is thought to reſpect divers parts, and thoſe different, and ſituate at a great diſtance one from another, and to reach forth its branchings, not only in the neighbourhood about the Head and Neck, but through the whole cavity of the middle and loweſt Belly, and to moſt of the Bowels in either. But indeed this nerve hath a province large enough, yet not ſo diffuſe as is commonly thought: for many other nerves, inoculated into this, joyn themſelves with it, and are accounted a part of it, although they have diſtinct be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, and going away again from the nerve of the eighth pair, have peculiar diva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rications, and different from it. Wherefore, that we may give to each its own, we ſhall endeavour to proſecute this nerve of the wandring pair from the beginning to the end; and alſo ſhew the confederations and coincidences or joynings together of others with it.</p>
                           <p>The eighth Conjugation therefore of the Nerves ariſes below the auditory or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nerves out of the ſides of the oblong Marrow, its root conſiſting of numerous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres. In a man there are at leaſt twelve, ſome of which are greater, others ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; to which is added a noted Fibre, or rather Nerve, much greater than the reſt, from the ſpinal Marrow, which being joyned with them, and wrapped about with the ſame Coat, taken from the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> goes forth together out of the Skull, as if they all grew into one Trunk: but that acceſſory nerve, yea and many other Fibres, do ſtill remain diſtinct under that covering, and afterwards departing aſunder, are carried into peculiar provinces.</p>
                           <p>Becauſe this ſpinal Nerve having paſſed the Skull, leaving its Conjugation, is carried to the muſcles of the Neck and Shoulders; beſides, the noted Fibre, out of the beginning of the wandring pair, is preſently carried into the hard proceſs of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Conjugation; and two other Fibres, having preſently left the company of the reſt, go into the muſcles of the Throat and Neck: but the reſt of the Fibres, being collected together, go forward ſtill as Companions, and inſtead of their other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions which departed from them, they preſently get new in their places; to wit, ſometimes the whole trunk of the intercoſtal nerve it ſelf, as is ſeen in moſt four-footed Beaſts, ſometimes only a branch of it comes to them, as is obſerved in Man and ſome other living Creatures.</p>
                           <p>In this place where the trunk or branch of the intercoſtal Nerve is inoculated into the trunk of the wandring pair, a noted infolding is conſtituted, to wit, the trunk of the nerve being there made greater, ſeems to be lifted up, and to grow out into a certain Tumor like to a callous or ſinewy-ſwelled body: here, for that it is ſomewhat long, it is called by <hi>Fallopius</hi> the Olive body; of which ſort the ſame Author affirms, there comes to this nerve ſometimes one, ſometimes two; but in truth, one is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly found in the trunk of the wandring pair, but the other in the neighbouring intercoſtal.</p>
                           <p>Of theſe ſort of infoldings in general we ſhall take notice, that they are made in the Nerves, as joynts in a Cane, or knots in the ſtem of a Tree, <hi>viz.</hi> as often as a branch goes out of the trunk, or ſliding into another place, is received into the ſame; and when oftentimes ſome ſhoots go away from the ſame place, and others come to it, the infolding there becomes greater; and ſo the more branches and ſhoots do happen to come together any where, or to go out of a nerve, the greater the bulk and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the infolding is increaſed: but if at any time a branch ſeems to proceed from any nerve without conſtituting an infolding, in truth, being included only in the ſame Coat, it is not accounted ſo much a branch as a companion, which by a paſſage long before, had gone together forwards, as a ſingle nerve it ſelf, and diſtinct enough, nor was it at all inoculated before its departure. But the uſe of theſe ſame infoldings ſeems to be the ſame with the knots in the ſtem of a Tree, or ſuch as the turnings aſide or by-paths that lye near croſs-ways; to wit, that when the animal Spirits, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:152521:181"/>
with the nervous Juyce, inſtitute divers journies, leſt mutually meeting, they ſhould be confounded, they may be able to turn aſide a little, and depart one from another till they may recover their orders and juſt method.</p>
                           <p>In the Diſſection of the Nerves, which are diſtributed to the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> the two Ganglioform infoldings, to wit, the aforeſaid in the trunk of the wandring pair, and the other near growing in the intercoſtal nerve, are as it were two bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtones, which being firſt diligently traced, the other threads of the Anatomical task, both on this and that ſide, are eaſily handled. But that theſe infoldings may be found, the trunk of the <hi>Carotidick</hi> Artery is laid open on both ſides between the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Neck; then by following its tract, the aforeſaid Olive bodies come into view about the inſertion of the lower Mandible; out of which, both the upper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings and the lower branchings of either nerve, may be deſigned or drawn. But becauſe about this place the nerves begin to be figured otherwiſe in a Man than in Brutes; that the reaſon of the difference may be known, we will here proſecute apart and diſtinctly the <hi>Neurologie</hi> or Doctrine of the Nerves of either; and firſt we ſhall deliver the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the wandring pair, and its confederations with the intercoſtal and other nerves, as they are found in Man.</p>
                           <p>The Ganglioform infolding therefore being conſtituted upon the Trunk of the wandring pair, receives one Nerve ſent into it elſewhere, and ſends forth another from it ſelf. To this is brought a ſhoot from the intercoſtal nerve different from moſt brute beaſts, where the whole trunk of the intercoſtal nerve comes, and ſeems to be united to the wandring pair. But from the aforeſaid infolding, a noted branch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent forth, is carried towards the <hi>Larynx,</hi> which when it is divided into three ſhoots, the firſt of them is ſtretched out into the Sphincter of the Throat; the ſecond being hid under the Scutiform or Shield-like Cartilage, diſtributes its ſhoots to the upper Muſcles of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> and to the Muſcles by which the chink of the <hi>Larynx</hi> is ſhut up; and the third alſo entring the Shield-like Cartilage, meets the top of the returning nerve, and is united to the ſame. Such an inoculating of this nerve, with the returning nerve, is conſtantly found in man and in all other perfect Animals; the reaſon of which is delivered anon.</p>
                           <p>Below the aforeſaid infolding of the wandring pair, its ſtem, near the ſide of the aſcending Caroditick Artery, goes forward ſtraight downwards, and in its journey imparts ſome ſmall ſhoots to the ſame, which ſometimes compaſs about the trunk of its Veſſel, ſometimes are inſerted into its Coats. In the lower part of the Neck this trunk of the wandring pair admits a branch of the intercoſtal nerve from its neighbouring infolding, and in the left ſide about that place ſends forth another nerve from it ſelf into the returning nerve; which croſs branch, being ſtretched out only in the left ſide, is found in man and all brute beaſts: but from thence the trunk of the wandring pair deſcends without any noted branchings till it comes over againſt the firſt or ſecond Rib; where another infolding being made, many ſhoots and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous fibres are ſent forth towards the Heart and its Appendix. But this divari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Cardiack nerves is not after the ſame manner altogether in either ſide.</p>
                           <p>For in the left ſide one or two noted ſhoots being ſent forth, together with other ſhoots ariſing from the intercoſtal Nerve, are inſerted into the Cardiack infolding; but many fibres going out at the ſame place, are diſtributed to the Veſſels hanging to the Heart, and to its little Ears and <hi>Pericardium.</hi> In the right ſide a noted ſhoot going into the greater <hi>Cardiack</hi> infolding, another into the leſs, and two other ſhoots from the middle infolding of the intercoſtal Trunk towards the Cardiack infolding, aſſociate themſelves and are united. Beſides, numerous Fibres in like manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into the Veſſels of the Heart and the <hi>Pericardium.</hi> Alſo the returning Nerve in this ſide ariſing higher, is turned back about the axillary Artery, when in the left ſide the ſame going away much lower than this infolding, from the Trunk of the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring pair, compaſſes about the deſcending Trunk of the Aorta, and from thence it is turned back upwards.</p>
                           <p>The returning Nerve, although it ſeems a branch ſent forth from the Trunk of the wandring pair, being indeed a diſtinct and ſingular nerve, comes even from the beginning of the wandring pair; yet for better conducts ſake it is contained under the ſame Coat with the reſt of the Trunk of the wandring pair. In either ſide about the knots of reflection or turning back, it ſends forth ſhoots and fibres which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed into the Veſſels of the Heart. The reflected Nerve in its aſcent receives in the left ſide a branch from the middle infolding of the Intercoſtal, and another from
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:152521:182"/>
the wandring pair; but either running back, diſtributes many ſhoots to the rough Artery; then its extremity meeting with the ſhoot, which is ſent out of the Ganglio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form infolding of the wandring pair, is united to it.</p>
                           <p>A little below the coming away of the returning Nerve on the left ſide from the Trunk of the wandring pair, another noted branch is ſent forth on both ſides; which being carried towards the Heart, covering its Baſis in the hinder Region, meets it on both ſides, and diſperſes in all its proceſs branches through the whole Superficies of the Heart. As ſhoots go from theſe branches into the hinder part of the Heart, ſo many branches and ſhoots go from the Cardiack infoldings which are divaricated into its fore-part.</p>
                           <p>But there are two Infoldings from which the Nerves are diſtributed into the Heart. The upper and greater is between the <hi>Aorta</hi> and the Pneumonick Artery. The nerves conſtituting this are one or two noted branches that deſcend hither from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide the Trunk of the wandring pair; but chiefly many nerves from either inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal nerve, to wit, from the midſt of its infolding. From this infolding two or three noted nerves are carried under the Aorta into the left ſide of the Heart. But from this infolding, a ſhoot being ſent forth, making as it were an handle, compaſſes about the pneumonick Artery; and a branch deſcending from the right Trunk of the wandring pair to the exterior part of this handle, and another, which being carried from the nerve which is deſtinated to the hinder region of the Heart, meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and make the leſſer infolding; from which nerves are ſent into the right ſide of the fore-part of the Heart.</p>
                           <p>We are to take notice, That in brute Animals many more and far greater Nerves are carried from the Trunk of the wandring pair into the Heart and its Appendix than in Man, to wit, in whom the chief Cardiack nerves or belonging to the Heart proceed from the intercoſtal pair, as is ſhewed below; wherefore in Brutes, for that reaſon, the wandring pair affords greater ſupplies or ſubſidies to the Heart, becauſe the intercoſtal nerve ſcarcely contributes any to it. Further, through the whole tract of the wandring pair, from whence the Cardiack nerves proceed, very many ſmall ſhoots, being ſent forth on both ſides, are inſerted into the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> and the Glandula's implanted without the <hi>Pericardium.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>From the Region of the Heart, the Trunk of the wandring pair ſends forth many noted ſhoots on both ſides, which being carried into the Lungs, are diſtributed, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the blood-carrying Veſſels, through their whole ſubſtance, and in their paſſage ſtep by ſtep they follow the Pipes of the <hi>Bronchia,</hi> both the Arteries and the Veins, and many ſhoots being ſent forth on every ſide, they climb upon and compaſs about theſe Veſſels; then the Trunk of the ſame wandring pair, deſcending on both ſides, nigh the ſides of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> diſtributes many ſhoots alſo into the Coats of the <hi>Oeſophagus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Below the Pneumonick branches, either Trunk of the wandring pair going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards downwards nigh the ſides of the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> is divided into two branches, <hi>viz.</hi> into the exterior or more outward, and the interior or more inward. Both the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward branches inclining towards one another mutually, do again grow into the ſame Nerve, which being ſent ſtraight down towards the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> and being carried nigh the inward part of its Orifice, is bent back from thence, and creeps through its upper part. From both branches, being carried nigh the oppoſite parts of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Orifice, many ſhoots are produced, which being mutually inoculated, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the nervous infolding like a little net. The Stomachical lower branch ſends forth very many fibres and ſhoots nigh the left part of the bottom of the Ventricle, which are united with others, ſent forth from the Meſenterick and Splenetick infold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Further, in the right part of the ſame bottom of the Ventricle, ſhoots being ſent forth from either Stomachical branch, are united with other ſhoots ſent upwards from the Hepatick infolding; and about this place either Trunk of the Nerves of the eighth pair ſeems to be terminated, for that the laſt that may be perceived of it are ſome ſhoots ſent forth from the Stomachical branches, which are inoculated or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed with the little branches or fibres ſent upwards from the Meſenterick infold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>

It now remains, recollecting the Tracts of this Deſcription, or at leaſt the things chiefly to be noted, that we inquire into the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their <hi>Phaenomena</hi> or Appearances.</p>
                           <p>This Nerve, preſently after its riſe, appears with numerous Fibres, as may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the ninth Figure <hi>E:</hi> the reaſon of which is, becauſe many nerves here ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing together, and deriving plenty of animal Spirits from the ſame ſtock or proviſion, ought to carry the ſame to divers parts, and remote one from another; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they aſſume their <hi>Latex</hi> or Juyce, not at one Trunk, as the blood-carrying Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and afterwards diſtribute it equally by branches and ſhoots here and there ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out; becauſe the Spirits, derived from the ſame Fountain, have need to flow into theſe parts ſeparate from them, and variouſly to tranſpoſe and change their influence: wherefore for this buſineſs it is required (that we may not ſuppoſe little doors in the middle of the branchings out of the nerves, as are in the Pipes of a muſical Organ) that the nerves, which are deſtinated for the performing of divers offices reſpectively in diſtinct parts, ſhould be ſingle in their whole paſſage, and of themſelves diſtinct chanels of Spirits; for the ſake of a better conduct many of them are collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſeem to grow together into one Trunk; but they are parted both in their beginning, and alſo in their whole journey, and diſtinguiſhed, though involved in the ſame Coat, and ſo are carried to the reſpective parts. Otherwiſe how ſhould it come to paſs, that the Spirits to be carried for the performing the inſtinct of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards the Stomach, do not enter at the ſame time the Lungs or <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and actuate them with an inordinate influence? For indeed the ſhoots of the nerves of the wandring pair may be followed by the eyes and hand backwards towards the beginning, from the parts into which they are inſerted, and where they ſeem to be united into the ſame Trunk, ſo ſeparated with the finger, that it may appear they are ſingle. After the ſame manner we have plainly ſeparated one from another the returning nerve alſo, and others, their common Coat being diſſected. Yet in the mean time we deny not, that in their progreſs they do communicate one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Fibres meeting mutually, if it be granted, that the ſame, although they ariſe together, in their very riſe it ſelf are in a manner diſtinct. For by reaſon of the nearneſs of the beginning and progreſs, though all the nerves of the wandring pair have a certain Sympathy and conſent in their actions; yet for that they conſiſt of parted ſtrings, they perform their actions ſucceſſively, and convey the influences of the Spirits to theſe parts ſeparate from thoſe.</p>
                           <p>We have already ſhewn, that the Nerve of the wandring pair, and others belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its family, do ſerve almoſt only to the involuntary function. Wherefore it may be thought, that as there are many ſhoots and fibres, which going out diſtinctly from the ſame origine, are carried to divers parts, that indeed thoſe Bowels and Members, into which theſe nerves are inſerted, do perform their particular actions, ſtirred up either by the inſtinct of Nature, or by the force of the Paſſions, the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal in the mean time ſcarce knowing it: yea alſo, that when certain other nerves, ariſing afar off, are joyned to this Trunk of the wandring pair, and communicate with it near the very origine of it; this ſeems to be therefore done, that thoſe nerves, an affinity with the wandring pair being begun, may be drawn into Sympathy with it, and into an unity of action of the involuntary Function. This appears clearly by the acceſſory nerve from the Back-bone, and ſome others, as ſhall be manifeſted anon.</p>
                           <p>In the mean time, we ſhall obſerve concerning the Fibres of the wandring pair, firſt that a noted ſhoot, inclining towards the vocal proceſs of the ſeventh pair, is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:152521:183"/>
united with the ſame, as in the ninth Figure <hi>e.</hi> Hence a reaſon may be taken, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in every violent Paſſion, as of Anger, Fear, Joy, and the like, without the will or intention of the Animal, the Tongue ſends forth a voice, as an index of the excited affection; ſo that not only men, but ſome brute beaſts, in their fleeing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, wail, cry out, and make a noiſe.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, From the beginning of the wandring pair very many Fibres are diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into the Muſcles of the Neck, Figure the ninth <hi>FFF.</hi> in which there ſeems lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle need of the ſtirring up of ſpontaneous motions in that part; for to this task the Vertebral nerves ſerve ſufficiently. Notwithſtanding the aforeſaid Fibres of the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring pair are the cauſe why the Neck is moved about in fear, or at any noiſe or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of danger; and alſo, why in ſome Animals, from indignation or pride, the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles into which theſe nerves are inſerted, being inflated very much, their necks ſwell up, and the Creſts of many are erected. Of how great uſe the acceſſory nerve, coming from the Spine to the wandring pair, is for the pathetick motions of the Arms, ſhall be ſhewed preſently.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, The other Fibres of the wandring pair, being gathered together, ſeem to grow together into the ſame Trunk, which preſently conſtitutes the Ganglioform infolding from a ſhoot coming from the intercoſtal nerve, as in Figure the ninth <hi>G.H.</hi> And indeed it is very likely, that of theſe Fibres, which are complicated together in the Trunk of the wandring pair, one is deſtinated to the returning nerve, another to the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> a third to the Lungs, and laſtly, another to the Ventricle; all which, although they have communication among themſelves, and for the ſake of a better conduct are gathered together in one, yet they are ſtill diſtinct from their very original, and conſtitute divers paſſages of the animal Spirits.</p>
                           <p>But that a ſhoot is carried from the intercoſtal Nerve into the upper infolding of the wandring pair, as in the ninth Figure <hi>h;</hi> the reaſon is, that between theſe nerves a certain ſtrict affinity and kindred might be, and that either of them might be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the others offices. For as the nerve of the wandring pair diſtributes ſhoots chiefly to the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and the Stomach, and the intercoſtal Nerve to the reſt of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the lower Belly; we may obſerve, that between all theſe there are not only ſome commerces, but Sympathies, and a conſent of Actions and Paſſions; wherefore there is a neceſſity, that the nerves deſigned to either parts, ſhould commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate among themſelves. Further, in Man the intercoſtal nerve imparts to the Heart and its Appendix more ſhoots and fibres than the nerve of the wandring pair: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe nerves do not only communicate by theſe ſuperiour infoldings, but alſo again a little lower by a ſhoot ſent out from the cervical infolding, or that of the Neck.</p>
                           <p>From the aforeſaid infolding a noted branch of the wandring pair is ſent forth into the Muſcles of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> a certain branch of which, entring the Shield-like Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilage, meets with the returning nerve, and is united to it <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>h.</hi> It will not be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to collect what the uſe of this nerve may be; for ſeeing the <hi>Larynx</hi> or the rough Artery ſerves both for the drawning in and putting out of the breath, and alſo for the modulating the voice; for either office that its Trunk, like the folds in a pair of Bellows, may become ſometimes more ſhort, ſometimes more at length, theſe ſame ringy Cartilages ought to be pulled together, or contracted ſometimes upward, and ſometimes downward. That a flat voice or ſound might be formed, they ought to be preſt down as much as may be to the bottom; but if you would form a more ſhrill or ſharp ſound or voice, the ſuperiour Rings are lifted up; to wit, that the ſound might be broken but only in the very paſſage of the Jaws. For the performing of this double motion of the <hi>Larynx</hi> two nerves are conſtituted like the hands of a Piper, one of which ſtops the lower holes, the other the upper of the Pipe: to wit, the ſhoots and branches of the returning nerve being lifted up from below, move the ringy Cartilages downwards; and the nerve ſent out from above from this infolding, preſently draws the more ſuperior upwards. Further, becauſe a certain conſent and joynt action is required in both nerves, therefore they are mutually inoculated or ingraffed: yea, whenas either of them returning, diſtributes frequent ſhoots into ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the <hi>Trachea;</hi> it ſeems that thoſe that are ſent out into the right part, move its Rings downwards for Inſpiration and a ſtrong Voice; and the others, going out on both ſides into the left part, carry the Rings upward for Expiration and for an acute or ſharp Voice. Moreover, as the inſtinct for the motion of depreſſion or preſſing down is delivered from the knots of the recourſe or reflections; ſo the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:152521:183"/>
for the elation or lifting up of thoſe parts, is received from this nerve of the <hi>Ganglioform</hi> infolding.</p>
                           <p>A noted branch from the middle infolding of the intercoſtal Nerve is carried into the Trunk of the wandring pair, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>i.</hi> For what end that is ſo, we have ſhewn already; to wit, that the commerces of the Spirits dwelling in both nerves, might be ſtrengthened: but it ſhould be noted, that it is only ſo in the left ſide where the Trunk of the wandring pair ſhews it ſelf ſingle for a long ſpace; but in the right ſide, where the returning nerve goes from it much higher, here the other nerve from the intercoſtal infolding is plainly wanting.</p>
                           <p>About the Region of the firſt or ſecond Rib, another noted infolding appears in the Trunk of the wandring pair, from which many ſhoots and fibres are ſent towards the Heart and its Appendix, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>k.</hi> Further, in brute Animals, about this place, the intercoſtal nerve leaves the Trunk of the wandring pair. Without doubt, ſome animal Spirits go apart in this infolding, which are deſtinated to the anterior region of the Heart, alſo to the <hi>Pericardium</hi> and ſome of its Veſſels, whilſt other Spirits paſs through, which a little lower are derived into the hinder region of the Heart; and which being yet carried further, go to the Lungs, and laſtly to the Ventricle.</p>
                           <p>We may obſerve, that from the aforeſaid infolding of the wandring pair numerous ſhoots and fibres are ſent forth, which are diſtributed into the little ears of the Heart and all the ſanguiferous Veſſels belonging to the Heart, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>l. m.</hi> which fibres and nervous ſhoots creeping along like Ivy, thickly cover over the Coats of the Veſſels, and enter them in very many places, and variouſly bind them about. Truly this copious diſtribution of the nerves doth effect the pulſifick force in the little ears of the Heart and in the Arteries, or at leaſt ſeems to excite it; and ſo to erect and ſtrengthen thoſe parts by a continual influx of the animal Spirits through theſe nerves, that they may be able to ſuſtain an undiſcontinued reciprocation of <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole.</hi> Moreover, that the thick fibres and ſhoots of the nerves are inſerted both into the Veins and Arteries, and bind both thoſe kind of Veſſels, and variouſly compaſs them about, we may lawfully ſuppoſe, that theſe nerves, as it were Reins put upon theſe blood-carrying Veſſels, do ſometimes dilate, and ſometimes bind them hard toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the determining the motion of the Blood according to the various force of the Paſſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to deduce it here and there after a manifold manner; for by this means it comes to paſs, that in fear the excurſion of the blood is hindred, and in other Affections its motion is reſpectively altered.</p>
                           <p>But that many ſhoots and branches are inſerted into the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> it ſeems to be for this uſe; to wit, that that little Cheſt which is made like a Fort for the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Heart from injuries, as often as any troubleſom matter aſſaults or beſieges it, might be able to draw it ſelf together, and to ſhake off the enemy. For it ſeems, that the inordinate tremblings and ſhakings of the Heart, which are manifeſtly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from its natural Pulſe, proceed from the violent ſhaking of this Membrane.</p>
                           <p>As to the Cardiack branches ſent from this infolding we obſerve, that they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe deſtinated to a publick office, do therefore communicate and enter into the pairs of either ſide before they are inſerted into the Heart; for which end the infold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is made before the Baſis of the Heart, where the aforeſaid ſhoots, from the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring pair and many others, going out from either intercoſtal nerve, meet together. From that infolding, placed between the <hi>Aorta</hi> and the pneumonick Artery, very many branches being ſent forth above, cover over the Hemiphere of the Heart: but yet from theſe certain branches, carried under the <hi>Aorta,</hi> are brought into the left ſide of the ſaid Hemiſphere; and as other pairs tend towards the right ſide, one of the firſt of them, making a little handle, binds about the pneumonick Artery; then meeting with other Cardiack ſhoots, makes the leſſer infolding, out of which bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are ſent forth into the right and anterior ſide of the Heart. That from the greater Cardiack infolding, nerves departing one from another, do inſtitute contrary journies towards the Heart, it is indeed, that they might come to divers regions of the Heart without meeting one another, and might affect its Veſſels reſpectively in their paſſage; to wit, the branches carried this way, inſert their ſhoots into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> and from the others going that way, one compaſſes about the pneumonick Artery. The reaſon of both ſeems to be, that the blood might be either ſooner or ſlower drawn from the boſoms of the Heart for its various need or neceſſity. For whilſt the aforeſaid nerves do both ſuſtain its motion by their influx, and alſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and temper it by their inſtinct, it ſo comes to paſs from thence, that thoſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:152521:184"/>
Veſſels alſo, being affected by the ſame nerves, do further compoſe themſelves to the requiſite Analogies and proportions of the Pulſes.</p>
                           <p>Indeed there are many Nerves, and thoſe conſpicuous enough, which are inſerted into the Heart, and cover its outward ſubſtance with ſhoots ſent forth from all ſides; yet it is not to be thought, that theſe nerves alone perform and ſuſtain the undiſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued motion of the Heart: becauſe ſo ſmall little ropes ſeem too unequal for the perpetual agitation of ſuch a Machine. Yea it may be obſerved, that more ſhoots and fibres of nerves are diſtributed into the little ears of the Heart and the depending Veſſels, than into its frame or ſubſtance. Further, it is obvious to any that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, that there is a greater plenty of nerves deſtinated to the Lungs, Liver, Spleen, Ventricle, or Reins, than to the Heart it ſelf; ſo that ſome Anatomiſts (as <hi>Fallopius</hi> ſays) were doubtful, whether there were any nerves that belonged to the Heart or not. But this being clear enough, that we may deſcribe the motive power of this Clock or Machine ſtirred up by the help of ſome ſmall nerves, as it were an exploſive motion, we ſay that the ſubſtance of the Heart it ſelf conſiſts of a very fibrous fleſh, and may rather be called a Muſcle than <hi>Parenchyma</hi> or congealed ſubſtance: wherefore in this, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Muſcles, the implanted and proper fibres cauſe the local motion and conſtant ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; but by the inſerted nerves is only conveyed the inſtinct of the motion or action; for the performing of which office, both fewer Nerves and fewer animal Spirits flowing in through their paſſages, do ſuffice. But indeed we ſuppoſe, that the animal Spirits implanted in the Heart, and abiding within its Fibres, did at firſt flow thither through the nerves, and that by this way their expences or loſs are made up or ſupplied; yet that the animal Spirits, which ſeem to be diſpenſed to the Heart by ſo ſparing an hand, may ſuffice for the actuating this perpetual motion, they receive continually ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary Forces from the arterious blood. For elſewhere we have ſhewed, that in the Heart, as in the whole muſculous ſtock beſides, a ſulphureous Copula, from the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted blood, is joyned to the ſpirituous ſaline Particles of the implanted Spirits; which matter, whilſt the Spirits are agitated, being at length ſtruck off, and as it were exploded (juſt like the rarified and inkindled Particles of Gun-powder) for the effecting the motive endeavour, do blow up or intumifie the Muſcle or the Heart it ſelf; and ſo from the indiſcontinued action of the Heart much of this ſulphureous Copula, which is eaſily ſupplied from the blood, and leſs of the Spirits, which are brought by the paſſage of the nerves, is beſtowed.</p>
                           <p>And here it may be rightly inquired into, whether the Pulſe of the Heart ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily depends on the influence of the animal Spirits through the Nerves, that it being hindred, the action of the Heart ſhould wholly ceaſe? For the deciſion of this, we once made a tryal of the following Experiment upon a living Dog. The skin about the Throat being cut long-ways, and the Trunk of both the wandring pair being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated apart, we made a very ſtrict Ligature; which being done, the Dog was preſently ſilent, and ſeemed ſtunned, and ſuffered about the Hypochondria convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive motions, with a great trembling of the Heart. But this affection quickly ceaſing, afterwards he lay without any ſtrength or lively aſpect, as if dying, ſlow and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to any motion, and vomiting up any food that was given him: nevertheleſs his life as yet continued, neither was it preſently extinguiſhed after thoſe nerves were wholly cut aſunder; but this Animal lived for many days, and ſo long, till through long faſting, his ſtrength and ſpirits being worn out, he died. The carcaſs being opened, the blood wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>hin the Ventricles of the Heart, and the Veſſels on every ſide reaching from thence, to wit, both the Veins and Arteries, being greatly coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was gathered into clotters; to wit, for this cauſe, becauſe the blood, though for the ſuſtaining of life, it was in ſome meaſure circulated, yet for the moſt part it ſtagnated both in the Heart, and in the Veſſels. The cauſe of which ſtagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I can aſſign to no other thing, than that the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> the influence of the animal Spirits being hindred, wanted its uſual motions.</p>
                           <p>If it ſhould be further demanded, from whence the animal Spirits (the paſſage of both the wandring pair being ſhut up) ſhould be ſupplied to the Heart continuing ſtill its motion; I ſay, that this may be done by the returning Nerves, as from the knots of which many Cardiack ſhoots and fibres proceed; and beſides, the end of either nerve meeting with the nerve ſent from the upper infolding, is united. But we ſhewed already, that the animal Spirits may be carried either this way or that way within the paſſages of the nerves; wherefore when the neceſſity of life urges, the proviſion of the Spirits, though leſſer, being ſent from the aforeſaid infolding, is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:152521:184"/>
received by the tail of the returning nerve, and from thence by a retrograde paſſage it was derived into the Cardiack branches, and at length into the Heart it ſelf. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there lyes open alſo another paſſage, and that perhaps more obvious, through the paſſage of the intercoſtal nerve: by this way in a man, as well as by the paſſage of the wandring pair, the Spirits are conveyed from the Brain to the <hi>Praecordia;</hi> yea alſo in Brutes a branch is carried into the Trunk of the wandring pair from the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal infolding; ſo that by this by-path ſome little rills of the animal Spirits (if by chance their influence ſhould be hindred through their wonted chanels) might be carried to the Heart. However that Experiment ſeems to conclude, that the motion of the Heart depends no leſs upon the inflowing of the blood, than upon that of the animal Spirit: the total privation of either takes away life; an Eclipſe of the Spirits wholly takes away from the Heart its motive power; and by the defect of the blood (foraſmuch as the ſulphureous Copula is denied to the Spirit implanted in the Heart) the vigour and elaſtick force of the Heart is ſuppreſt, ſo that the Pulſe being by degrees weakened, life is by little and little extinguiſhed. Without doubt, in the finding out the tenour of the Pulſe, we ought always to mind what the alteration of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, and what the fault of the blood may bring to it.</p>
                           <p>There is yet another conſideration concerning the Nerves reaching from the Trunk of the wandring pair to the Heart, to wit, that by their paſſage, not only the ſolemn influence and ſtate of the Spirits, for the equally performing of the vital Function, is conveyed; but alſo the inſtinct of every irregular motion, ſtirred up in the <hi>Praecordia</hi> by the force of the Paſſions, is in ſome meaſure transferred this way. I ſay, as to theſe, we ought to diſcourſe and to ſhew by what means, as often as the impreſſion of any Affection exerciſes the Imagination, or rather the Appetite, preſently the <hi>Praecordia</hi> are diſturbed by the paſſage of the Nerves, and by reaſon of their various Affections the motion of the blood is diverſly altered. But becauſe in a man the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular and extraordinary motions of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> depend on the intercoſtal Nerve as much as and perhaps more than on the wandring pair; therefore we think good to defer this Speculation till the Theory of that Nerve is propoſed. In the mean time, we will proceed to the other branches of the wandring pair; and what next follows, we will inquire into the offices and uſes of the returning Nerves.</p>
                           <p>The returning Nerve in the left ſide, going away from the wandring pair below the aforeſaid infolding, and ſent towards the <hi>Aorta,</hi> is reflected or turned back about its deſcending Trunk, from whence being carried upwards, it imparts ſhoots to the Muſcles of the <hi>Trachea</hi> and the <hi>Larynx</hi> ſent forth by a long tract from either ſide of the Nerve; then its top or height is united with a ſhoot meeting it out of the Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glioform infolding, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>n. **** h.</hi> But the returning Nerve on the right ſide is reflected much higher about the axillar Artery, to wit, proceeding from the lower infolding of the wandring pair, and after the ſame manner is beſtowed on the other ſide of the <hi>Trachea, Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>L.</hi> But either returning back about the knots of refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſends forth towards the Heart very many ſhoots and fibres, which are inſerted into its little ears, the appending Veſſels or its Infoldings.</p>
                           <p>What the chief uſe of this Nerve is, we have already ſhewn; to wit, being rolled about on both ſides the Artery, as it were a Windlace, it cauſes the little rings of the <hi>Trachea</hi> or Weaſand to be drawn hither and thither, like the folds of a pair of Bellows, both for breathing and making a ſound. But indeed either Nerve, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it being reflected about the Artery, is carried upward into the part to be moved, doth move downwards the little rings of the <hi>Trachea</hi> or Wind-pipe by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhoots of it; alſo foraſmuch as either is terminated in the Nerve, ſent from the Ganglioform infolding, it carries upwards the folds of the <hi>Trachea</hi> by other ſhoots of it. Hence a reaſon may be given, why the returning Nerves being cut off, every Animal is preſently dumb; to wit, becauſe, unleſs the <hi>Trachea</hi> be moved, the breath being blown out, paſſing without any refraction through its cavity, as it were through a Pipe alike hollow in its whole paſſage, gives no ſound.</p>
                           <p>Concerning theſe Nerves we ought to inquire, what is the reaſon of the difference, that the knots of reflection are not alike on both ſides; alſo for what end the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack branches proceed from both knots. As to the firſt, that the left returning Nerve, not as its pair, binds about the axillary Artery, ſome reaſon ſeems to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the left axillary Artery, ariſing below, is carried as the right, by a bending, and not a ſtraight paſſage, into the Arm; wherefore the little cord of the Nerve, compaſſing about its Trunk, hath no fixed, but a very moveable knot of reflection,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:152521:185"/>
for that it might eaſily ſlide from its place. But it may rather be ſaid, that it is for other uſes, and thoſe more neceſſary, that theſe Nerves compaſs about thoſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels after that manner. For when they, as it were Reins or Bridles caſt on the blood-carrying Veſſels, by pulling them hither and thither, variouſly determine the courſe of the blood, it ſeems to be required, that one returning Nerve ſhould bind together or conſtringe the axillary Artery, and the other the deſcending Trunk of the <hi>Aorta:</hi> for as often as there is need for the blood to flow forwards towards the Head more plentifully, the returning Nerves perform it eaſily, by pulling upwards the aforeſaid Arteries: But the blood, after a ſort, ought to be continually urged into the higher parts, leſt otherwiſe by its weight it ſhould turn too much downwards; wherefore in all Expiration or breathing forth, when the <hi>Trachea,</hi> drawing nearer together its folds, is contracted upwards, the blood about to deſcend through the <hi>Aorta,</hi> is ſnatched upwards by one tract of the nervous little cord, and in like manner, the axillary Artery in the right ſide being ſhaken with it, the blood flowing in the whole aſcending Trunk of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> is driven upwards a little ſwifter.</p>
                           <p>But beſides this continual and equal ſnatching up of the blood towards the upper parts, it is ſometimes occaſionally urged towards the Head by a more intenſe and quick motion of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> and alſo by a more full and ſwift courſe. For as often as any Animal grows angry, the voice preſently ſhews ſigns of ſuch an Affection, and oftentimes by chiding, they make it ſharp; as men, when they are angry, chide or brawl, and Dogs bark: Now from ſuch an intenſion of the voice and chiding, as the upper rings of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> a reciprocation being there made, are often ſtruck to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; ſo the blood alſo (the <hi>Aorta</hi> being ſtrongly drawn) is urged upwards by a copious afflux, ſo that it preſently dyes the countenance and eyes of angry people with a redneſs, and induces to the Brain it ſelf a greater heat and provocatives to anger, and a greater glowing or infiring to the Spirits by ſtirring them up. For the ſame reaſon, in Joy and Gladneſs, foraſmuch as the <hi>Trachea</hi> is exerciſed by ſinging or laughing, the blood alſo is poured out more plentifully towards the exterior, and eſpecially the upper parts.</p>
                           <p>And from hence the cauſe is plain, wherefore either returning Nerve ſends forth Cardiack branches from the knot of reflection or turning back; to wit, that in thoſe kind of affections, the notice of which the <hi>Trachea</hi> in ſounds or voices gives by the help of the Nerves, the Heart it ſelf by its means alſo might be affected. For ſo, as often as we wrangle or brawl, the Heart being irritated, preſently inkindles the blood more, and drives it forward more plentifully, as food for thoſe Affections, towards the Brain. Alſo in laughter, great rejoycing, or ſinging, by the paſſage of thoſe Nerves, the Heart being brought into a conſent or Sympathy, or joynt action, preſently explodes or drives out the blood by a ſwifter pulſe, and caſts it haſtily out, which otherwiſe would be heavy and troubleſom by a ſlower motion or ſtagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; wherefore thoſe ſort of actions, to wit, laughing and ſinging, are ſaid to alleviate the Heart, becauſe they make the blood more freely and readily to be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the boſoms of the Heart, and alſo, by the ſupplying help of the Lungs, to be emptied into the ſame.</p>
                           <p>Below the production of the left returning Nerve another noted Nerve is carried towards the hindermoſt region of the Heart, which being carried with a certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs about its Baſis, ſends forth frequent ſhoots, which cover the left ſide of the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Hemiſphere, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>o.</hi> Then this branch meeting with another pair ſent from the oppoſite ſide towards the Heart, and diſtributing ſhoots into the right ſide of the hinder Hemiſphere, is united with it, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>q.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This Cardiack branch, deſtinated to the hinder region of the Heart, is produced apart below the reſt, that it might be carried by it ſelf to its Province without the meeting with or implication of others; the pairs are ingraffed on either ſide, that they might accompany one another, and be together drawn in the ſame action of the Heart. It appears not plain, whether theſe nerves conſpire with the other Cardiack nerves, ariſing above, reaching forth to the anterior Hemiſphere of the Heart; or whether this pair effect not the <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the Heart, and the upper its <hi>Diaſtole.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, certain ſhoots of the kindred or ſtock of either, being ingraffed with others of another ſtock, communicate one with the other.</p>
                           <p>The Trunk of the wandring pair ſends forth on both ſides very many noted bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from the region of the Heart, which are ſpread on every ſide into all the Lobes of the Lungs, the <hi>Bronchia</hi> of the <hi>Trachea,</hi> and the Coat of the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> hard by
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:152521:185"/>
deſcending, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>s.s.s.</hi> Thoſe which go into the Lungs paſs every where through their whole ſubſtance, following the ramifications of the Veins and Arteries, and the Pipes of the <hi>Bronchia,</hi> which chanels of blood and air they variouſly climb over, and bind about through their whole tract.</p>
                           <p>When that ſo many noted branchings of the Nerves are beſtowed on the Lungs, it is a wonder, that by ſome they ſhould be thought to be inſenſible and immoveable of themſelves. Yea it is doubted by many, whether theſe Bowels do cauſe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole</hi> of themſelves by their own endeavour. For that it is a received Opinion, That this reciprocation of the Lungs doth proceed wholly from the motion of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and doth obey or obſerve its dilatation or conſtriction with a certain neceſſary dependency; <hi>viz.</hi> that the Breaſt being dilated or ſpread open after the manner of a pair of Bellows doth compel the ambient Air into the <hi>Trachea,</hi> which ruſhing into the Lungs, blows up and diſtends them; then the ſame Breaſt ſubſiding or ſinking of it ſelf, that the Lungs being preſſed together with the weight of it, do breath forth the Air before intruded. In truth, however that I might judge, that the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and the Muſcles of the Breaſt do conduce much to Reſpiration; yet that theſe parts ſhould perform this office alone, and that the Lungs are merely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, I cannot grant. For Reſpiration is chiefly inſtituted for the ſake of the blood and the Heart, and its act is wont to be determined according to the various diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of theſe, and to be altered every minute of an hour almoſt according to the manifold neceſſity of the Pulſe. But indeed the Lungs themſelves are they (and not the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> or the Muſcles of the <hi>Thorax</hi>) which the blood, boiling out of the Heart, paſſes through, and continually affects according to its temper, and the tenour of the Pulſe: wherefore from hence it may be concluded, That the Lungs themſelves do conceive the firſt inſtincts of their motions, and by the help of the aforeſaid Nerves, do in ſome meaſure exerciſe themſelves, and endeavour the <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> and deſign them according to the ſenſe of its proper neceſſity; but when in theſe, Fibres requiſite for local motion are wanting, therefore the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and the Muſcles of the <hi>Thorax</hi> help continually the endeavours of the Lungs, and by the cooperation of theſe, compleat breathing is effected. And ſo when Nerves of a twofold kind, to wit, ſome from the Spine being inſerted into the Muſcles of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and others from the wandring pair diſtributed into the Lungs, actuate the Organs of Reſpiration; for that reaſon it comes to paſs, that the act it ſelf of Reſpiration, of it ſelf unforced and involuntary, may be at our pleaſure ſomewhat reſtrained, interrupted, and diverſly altered. The <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praxis</hi> or joynt action of the Nerves of either kind, in the work of Reſpiration, ſhall be ſhewed hereafter, when we ſhall ſpeak particularly of the Nerve of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It yet appears more plain, that the Lungs are oftentimes the chief in the act of Reſpiration, becauſe they being irritated from ſtrange and improportionate objects, preſently conceive irregular and violent motions; as when a vehement Cough is ſtirred up for the excluſion of any troubleſom thing; to which motion the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and the Muſcles of the <hi>Thorax</hi> preſently obey. In like manner, in difficult and ſighing breathing, or any other ways unequal, its firſt inſtinct for the moſt part is begun by the Lungs; yet ſometimes when the exterior Organs of Reſpiration are excited into irregular motions, the Lungs alſo are compelled to follow their irregularities; ſo when the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> after a manner begins laughter, the Lungs perform the ſame with a following cackling ſound: ſo all the Organs of Reſpiration intimately conſpire and agree among themſelves, that although one of them do a thing inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, rather than there ſhall be a Schiſm, the reſt do imitate or follow its irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity.</p>
                           <p>But that the Nerves, following the Arteries and Veins through the whole frame of the Lungs, do variouſly bind about and cloath their Trunks with a thick ſeries of ſhoots, the reaſon ſeems to be, both that the Coats of the Veſſels being gifted with a conſtant influx of animal Spirits, might imitate the motion of the Heart; and by that means, by a continual pulſation of the Arteries and the conſtriction of the Veins, they might eaſily carry the blood in this its more ſhort luſtration through the Lungs; and the rather, that the pneumonick Veſſels, being bound about with ſuch Reins of Nerves, might moderate the courſe of the blood according to the forces and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts of the Paſſions. For whenas the exterior circulation of the blood depends upon this interior; as the blood is commanded to paſs ſooner or ſlower through the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:152521:186"/>
Lungs, or to ſtay there and be hindred, the excurſion and return of it alſo from or towards the Heart is wholly performed. In Joy or Anger, becauſe the Lungs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly transfer the blood out of one boſom of the Heart to the other; therefore its ſwifter and more plentiful flowing out into the outward parts, follows. In like manner, in Fear and Sadneſs, for that the Lungs (its Veſſels being ſtrained together) deliver the blood to the Heart by the Veins, and do not then preſently carry it back by the Arteries, the outmoſt region of the Body is deſtitute of its due influx. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe kind of pathetick ſnatches of the blood are in ſome meaſure perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, becauſe its Veſſels are bound about in other places in like manner with the Nerves. If at any time Spaſmodick Affections ſhould afflict the pneumonick Nerves from a morbific cauſe, ſo that being twitcht with inordinate motions, they ſhould pull or draw together here and there the Arteries and Veins which they embrace; for that cauſe, the blood either too much flowing out of the Lungs, makes them to flag, and to fall together into themſelves, ſo that drawing to them copiouſly the Air, they do not eaſily render it back again; or, which frequently happens, the blood being detained within the Lungs, and there ſtagnating, ſtuffs them up, and holds them a long while ſtiff, that they cannot inſpire or drawn in the Air. The Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of either kind ordinarily happen in the Hyſterick diſtempers, and in ſome Hypochondriacal. Yea ſometimes the <hi>Bronchia</hi> themſelves are pulled together by the like Convulſion of the Nerves, and are hindred in their motion, ſo that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take in and ſend forth the Air after its due manner, as may be ſeen in Aſthma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Fits. The diſtempers of which ſort are oftentimes produced by the fault of the Nerves, without any implanted Dyſcraſie or evil diſpoſition of the Lungs. I have ſometimes obſerved ſome Caſes of ſick people, in which, when at one time the morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick matter beſieging the Brain, had induced Lethargick or Vertiginous Symptoms, a little after the ſame matter occupying or poſſeſſing the origines or middle proceſſes of the nerves belonging to the Lungs, has ſuddenly excited a moſt horrid Aſthma without any previous Cough or Catarrh.</p>
                           <p>But that out of the ſame tract of the wandring pair many ſhoots are diſtributed into the Lungs, and alſo many others into the Coats of the <hi>Oeſophagus;</hi> from hence a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be given, why a troubleſom Cough oftentimes cauſes Vomiting and a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Ventricle; why alſo on the other ſide a perturbation of the Ventricle ſo frequently induces a troubleſom endeavour of Coughing. I have known in Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacks, that aliments of ill digeſtion, taken into the Stomach, have preſently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited a vain and very pertinacious Cough; in the mean time, that the Lungs were free from any conſumptive diſpoſition. The cauſe of either diſtemper ſeems to be, that when the nerves, diſſeminated in either part, are taken with a Convulſion, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoſe which are of the other part, are drawn into a conſent of the ſame diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Perhaps from hence it happens, that ſometimes an Aſthma is induced by reaſon of the evil of the Ventricle, and that that diſtemper (as <hi>Riverius</hi> obſerves) is often wont to be cured by an emetick Medicine.</p>
                           <p>After ſo many branches and ſhoots have been ſent from both ſides the wandring pair, at length its Trunk is divided below the Lungs into two branches, <hi>viz.</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior and interior; either of which inclining towards the pair of branches on the other ſide, are united to them, and after a mutual communication they conſtitute the two Stomachical branches, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſuperior and the inferior, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>t. u. w. x.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It is worth obſerving, with what wonderful artifice either Trunk of the wandring pair do communicate one with the other with two branches, as it were two hands meeting one the other, that the influence of either nerve might equally reach to every region and part of the Stomach. For whenas either Stomachical branch, to wit, both the upper and the lower, is carried together from the two branches coming out from either ſide of the wandring pair; it is provided, that the Tributes of the Spirits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated to the Ventricle, ſhould be at once certain and very plentiful. For what appertains to the performing the action of this Bowel or Chylification, the Spirits flowing in from either ſide, are abundantly diſtributed into the Orifice, and from thence into all its parts and private places; and by that means it comes to paſs, that the Stomach diſſolves bodies beyond the force of any Chymical Menſtruum. Then beſides, as to the feeling or ſenſe of the Ventricle, or the affection of it from things ingeſted; it is carried alſo towards the Head by a double way (whereby the paſſage may be the more certain) to wit, by either Trunk of the wandring pair; that for that reaſon being indued with a moſt exquiſite ſenſe, it might not be deceived con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:152521:186"/>
its objects; and if that any thing inimical or contrary to it, ſhould lye hid among what is eaten, it might diſcern it and thruſt it out of its own accord, or at leaſt by the knowledge only of the Cerebel.</p>
                           <p>That from the ſame double Trunk of the wandring pair, from whence the Cardiack Nerves ariſe a little above, the Stomachical branches alſo proceed, the cauſe is plain wherefore the Heart it ſelf hath ſuch a Sympathy with the Stomach, ſo that its <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium</hi> or Swooning follows upon any great pulling or hawling of this.</p>
                           <p>Either Nerve of the wandring pair is terminated in the Ventricle it ſelf: for after the eighth Conjugation hath made as it were an high road for the paſſage of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits to the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and to this noble Bowel, it puts a bound to it ſelf; nor indeed does it ſeem meet to have its branches ſtretched out any further to the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the lower Belly: becauſe it ſeems an unworthy thing, that the ſame path which leads to the chief office of nutrition and to the Palaces of life it ſelf, ſhould lye open to the more vile Inteſtines alſo, and the ſink of the whole Body. And truly, although the ample path and broad way of the wandring pair is not produced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Ventricle, yet becauſe a frequent commerce happens between this and the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and the other inferior parts; therefore between the Stomach and the other Bowels, though of a more baſe uſe, certain Fibres, as it were ſmaller paths, are reached forth, in which, at leaſt little bands of Spirits, like Diſcoverers or Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, run to and fro.</p>

                           <head>CHAP. XXV. <hi>A Deſcription of the Intercoſtal Nerve.</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>AFter the unfolding of the Nerve reaching forth to the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, we are led by the ſeries or order of the inward parts to the deſcribing a Nerve akin to this, and which reaches forth its branches to the furthermoſt Province, to wit, to all the <hi>Viſcera</hi> or Inwards of the lower Belly contained below the Ventricle. This is commonly called the Intercoſtal, becauſe that going near the roots of the Ribs, it receives in every one of their Interſtices a branch from the ſpinal Marrow. Its beginning is not yet ſufficiently detected; for by moſt Anatomiſts it is wrongfully taken for a branch of the wandring pair, though indeed the wandring and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal pair do communicate among themſelves by branches ſent forth one to the other; yet as to both their beginnings, Trunks and wandrings up and down, they are plainly diſtinguiſhed. If that this latter Conjugation, being denied the title of a peculiar nerve, ought to confeſs it ſelf of another ſtock, certainly it owes nothing to the wandring pair, but ſhould borrow its original from the Nerves of the fifth and ſixth pairs; for two or three ſhoots being ſent back from thoſe nerves going out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eyes and Face, go into the ſame ſtock or Trunk, which is the Trunk of the intercoſtal nerve, as we have intimated before.</p>
                           <p>The intercoſtal Nerve being conſtituted after that manner, and going out of the Skull at a proper hole, preſently contains the Ganglioform infolding, near to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like infolding of the wandring pair; into which two nervous Proceſſes are carried from the laſt pair within the Skull, or the firſt Vertebral. From that infold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one ſhoot is ſent forth into the Sphincter of the Throat, and another noted one into the Ganglioform infolding of the wandring pair. Then this nerve deſcending towards the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> hath in the middle of the Neck another far greater infolding, into which an ample nerve, from the neighbouring Vertebral pair, is inſerted; but from the ſame many nerves, which reſpect the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> are diſtributed on every ſide: For two or three ſhoots are ſent forth into the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and one ſhoot into the returning nerve; beſides, numerous fibres and ſhoots are carried both into the returning nerve, and towards the <hi>Trachea,</hi> which are inſerted into its Coats, and into thoſe of the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> and into the blood-carrying Veſſels. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one branch deſcends into the Trunk of the wandring pair, and two noted nerves into the Cardiack infolding; then a little lower another nerve by it ſelf, proceeding out of the intercoſtal Trunk, is inſerted alſo into the Cardiack infolding: which noted branches ſent down on both ſides from the intercoſtal nerve, for that they joyn
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:152521:187"/>
together with others derived from either Trunk of the wandring pair, make the Cardiack infolding it ſelf. But theſe Cardiack branches from the intercoſtal nerve, as alſo the Cervical infolding, or that in the hinder part of the Neck, whence they proceed, are peculiar to men, and are wholly wanting in brute beaſts.</p>
                           <p>The intercoſtal Trunk deſcends from the cervical infolding towards the chanel-bone, where being about to enter the cavity of the Breaſt, it falls upon the axillary Artery, as it were in right Angles, and ſtrains or binds it; from whence it is drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or hidden in the <hi>Thorax</hi> near the roots of the firſt and ſecond Ribs; and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving three or four branches from the Vertebral nerves next to thoſe uppermoſt, conſtitutes another infolding, which is commonly called the Intercoſtal infolding. The uppermoſt of theſe Vertebral nerves coming to this infolding in its journey binds the Vertebral Artery, and almoſt compaſſes it about. In Brutes by this nerve which comes upon the Vertebral Artery, the intercoſtal infolding communicates with the root of the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and not by any other means, unleſs by ſmall fibres ſent forth from the lower part of the infolding into the Vertebral nerves. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in Brutes a noted branch is carried from this infolding into the Trunk of the wandring pair. But in Man the intercoſtal Trunk paſſes through the cavity of the <hi>Thorax</hi> without any communication had with the other parts; unleſs that from hence in its whole deſcent, running near the roots of the Ribs, it admits in every one of their interſpaces, and from thence even to the <hi>Os ſacrum</hi> from between the knots of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> a Vertebral branch.</p>
                           <p>The intercoſtal pair ſends forth a noted branch on either ſide, where having gone through the cavity of the <hi>Thorax</hi> or Breaſt, it comes over againſt the bottom of the Ventricle, which tending towards the <hi>Meſentery,</hi> conſtitutes the chief infoldings of it. But there are ſeven Meſenterick infoldings, <hi>viz.</hi> five great ſuperior, and two leſs inferior: out of all which, numerous ſhoots and fibres are ſent forth together into the parts which they reſpect, and into the neighbouring infoldings. The Meſenterick nerves, which are carried into theſe infoldings, and the infoldings themſelves, and alſo the fibres and ſhoots, which flow out from them on every ſide, like rays of light, are diſpoſed according to the following manner both in Man and in the more perfect Brutes.</p>
                           <p>The Meſenterick branch therefore in the left ſide going from the intercoſtal Nerve, and bending downwards, is parted into two noted ſhoots: the greater of theſe bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back upwards towards the Stomach, diffuſeth it ſelf preſently into an infolding, as a narrow rivulet into a ſpacious Pool. From this infolding numerous fibres and ſhoots go forth as it were in four bands. The firſt of theſe, and which is the greateſt bundle of its fibres, being carried into the Ventricle, is beſtowed partly in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of it, and partly theſe fibres are met, and ingraffed with others ſent from the-Stomachical branch. The other maniple or band of nervous Fibres goes forth from this infolding to the Spleen, where the nerves accompanying the ſanguiferous Veſſels, and variouſly binding them about, are diſperſed into the more inward frame or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Spleen; yet out of which going towards the Spleen, ſome ſhoots follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhort Veſſels, are carried into the Stomach. The third Company of nervous Fibres is inſerted between this infolding and the Hepatick or that belonging to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, placed in the right ſide over againſt it. Laſtly, the fourth Conjugation of Fibres knits together this and the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery lying under it.</p>
                           <p>The lower ſhoot of the Meſenterick branch, which is on the left ſide, increaſes into an infolding, to which the next Vertebral branch, deſtinated to the intercoſtal Nerve, is carried. From this infolding the chief bundle of nervous Fibres is carried into the left Kidney, and before the Fibres enter the Reins, they bind and variouſly compaſs about the emulgent Veſſels. Further, between this infolding and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Meſentery many Fibres are ſtretched out; from hence alſo many ſhoots are diſtributed into the atrabilary Cheſt, or the Receptacle of the Spleens excrements.</p>
                           <p>In the right ſide the Meſenterick branch being ſent from the intercoſtal Trunk, and being in like manner twofold, contains in its upper ſhoot the Hepatick infolding; out of which the greateſt bundle of nervous Fibres is carried towards the Liver; nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ſhoots of which accompanying the blood-carrying Veſſels, greatly beſet, and as it were cloath with a little net the Trunk of the Hepatick Artery: which fibres and ſhoots, being carried higher, are diſtributed into the Liver, the Gall-cheſt or bag, the paſſage of the Gall, the Pylorus, and the Pancreas. Further, many Fibres, which are of this Conjugation, meet with Fibres ſent from either Stomachical nerve, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:152521:187"/>
are ingraffed into them. Another handful of nervous Fibres is ſtretched out between this infolding and the oppoſite infolding belonging to the Spleen, and another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this and the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery; yea, there is ſome communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation had between this and that belonging to the Kidney lying under the ſame ſide by a large ſhoot ſent down.</p>
                           <p>The lower ſhoot of the right Meſenterick branch, like as it is in the oppoſite ſide, contains a ſufficiently noted infolding nigh the atrabilary Cheſt; to which preſently the intercoſtal Nerve imparts its Vertebral branch received below. From this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding the chief bundle of nervous Fibres deſtinated to the Reins, embraces the blood-carrying Veſſels in like manner as in the oppoſite ſide; alſo many fibres and ſhoots are ſtretched out from this infolding to thoſe near, <hi>viz.</hi> the Hepatick and the greateſt of the Meſentery; yea, certain Fibres are diſperſed from the ſame into the atrabilary Cheſt.</p>
                           <p>After this manner either Meſenterick branch being carried from the Intercoſtal pair, and being preſently twofold, immediately conſtitutes two infoldings in either ſide. In the midſt of theſe the greateſt infolding of all ſtands like the Sun in the midſt of the Planets; from which numerous ſhoots and fibres are diſperſed into all the parts of the Meſentery; which indeed following the blood-carrying Veſſels in their whole proceſs, climb over and bind about the ſame. Moreover, between this infolding and every one of the four aforeſaid is produced a peculiar little bundle of Fibres. Beſides, in the female Sex, from hence ſome ſhoots are carried into the Glandula's of the Womb, commonly called the Stones. But from the Meſenterick branches, which conſtitute the former infoldings, no noted branches, but only little ſhoots, are ſent into this infolding. Yea the chief Nerve which is inſerted to this, and ſeems to be the primary for the conveying of plenty of Spirits into it, and a broad way, is carried from a certain ſmall infolding far lower nigh the ſtraight Inteſtine; which infolding, together with the other neighbouring one, that we call the leſſer infoldings of the Meſentery, ſhall be deſcribed preſently. In the mean time, that we may proceed to them in order, we will follow the paſſage of the intercoſtal Nerve.</p>
                           <p>Below the Meſenterick branches, from which the aforeſaid ſuperior infoldings are conſtituted, the intercoſtal Trunk deſcends between the Muſcles of the Loyns, and beſtows every Vertebral branch, admitted in its deſcent, upon ſome internal parts.</p>
                           <p>For the Vertebral branch brought to the intercoſtal Trunk nigh both Kidneys, is carried into the Womens Teſticles, then ſome following into the Ureters. From the Region of the twenty ſeventh <hi>Vertebra</hi> one Vertebral branch and two others, going from the intercoſtal Trunk, tend towards the ſtraight Inteſtine, and there they meet with three pairs ſent from the other ſide; all which being united, conſtitute the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding, which is the loweſt of the Abdomen. From this infolding a noted Nerve, being carried upwards, is brought into the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery, which in its journey receives one and then another ſhoot ſent down on both ſides from the intercoſtal Nerve; and there, near its bounds, diſtributes ſome ſhoots into the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula's of the Womb.</p>
                           <p>But from the loweſt aforeſaid Infolding, a Nerve going towards the upper Infold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, about the ſpace of an inch, conſtitutes another leſſer infolding in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; out of which one Nerve tends upwards, and another oppoſite ſtraight down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. The former of theſe is carried into the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery, and in its whole paſſage ſtretches under the ſtraight Inteſtine, and part of the <hi>Colon,</hi> and inſerts into them many ſmall ſhoots. But the other Nerve deſcending from this infolding towards the <hi>Anus</hi> under the inferior part of the ſtraight Inteſtine, imparts to it alſo frequent ſhoots; ſo that this infolding, the leaſt of all thoſe which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Abdomen, ſeems to be conſtituted for the ſake of this Nerve only, to wit, which lying under the ſtraight Inteſtine and part of the <hi>Colon,</hi> is inſerted into the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery.</p>
                           <p>From the loweſt neighbouring Infolding, to which this leaſt owes its original, two Nerves going out, and being ſent down into the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> cauſe there two infoldings, <hi>viz.</hi> one in either ſide, in which the Nerves coming from the <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> and ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with the former, meet; from which alſo the Nerves diſtributed into the adjacent parts, ſerve unto the ſeveral Excretions, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Urine, Dung, and Seed made in that place: for two Nerves enter into the end of the ſtraight Inteſtine, and as many into the Womb or Proſtates; but one, and that a noted one, is carried into the Bladder.</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>THE beginning of the Intercoſtal Nerve are two or three ſhoots reflected or turned back from the Nerves of the fifth and ſixth pair, and united into the ſame Trunk, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>D. a. a. b.</hi> Here we may wonder at the birth of this Nerve, as it were borrowed; for it grows as a ſhrub upon another tree or ſhrub; and therefore diſpenſes the common virtues and influences of either with a double branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> both its own and that of its parent: by which ramification or branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it comes to paſs, that there are very quick commerces and conſent between the conceptions of the Brain and the affections of the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> alſo between the Actions and Paſſions almoſt of all the parts of the whole Body, which belong to the involuntary Function. For in that the Trunk of the intercoſtal Nerve proceeds from the Nerves of the fifth and ſixth pair nigh their beginnings, that is a ſign that both the influence of the animal Spirits, and the inſtincts for the performing of motions, are derived chiefly into it from the Cerebel; to wit, from whoſe annular proceſs the aforeſaid pairs of Nerves ariſe. But foraſmuch as the ſame intercoſtal Nerve is rooted in their Trunks, and not immediately in the Cerebel; this is the reaſon why the Eyes, as alſo the parts of the Mouth and Face, to which the fifth and ſixth pairs have regard, do anſwer ſo readily and unknown to the Cerebel, as it were by the ſame act, to the motions of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> which the intercoſtal Nerve effects; and on the contrary, the motions of theſe preſently follow the action of thoſe. As for example, in Sneezing as ſoon as the nervous Fibres beſmearing the Noſtrils, are wrinkled together by the pulling, preſently by the paſſage of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal nerve the Diaphragma, by reaſon of a more deep inſpiration or drawing in the breath, is for ſome time depreſſed; then the Cramp of the Noſtrils remitting, the Midriff alſo being violently drawn back, cauſes a more ſtrong breathing forth with a vehement blowing of the Air. In like manner on the contrary, when by a tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling made upon the Ribs, the Diaphragma being affected with a Spaſm, moves to a cackling noiſe, the Face and Mouth are pathetically figured with it into laughter.</p>
                           <p>The intercoſtal Nerve being ſlid out of the Skull, preſently conſtitutes the Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glioform infolding, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>G.</hi> it being after the ſame manner in the Trunk of the wandring pair. What the uſe of theſe infoldings is in general, we have already ſhewn; and clearly for the ſame reaſon in this place in the intercoſtal Trunk, where it receives into it ſelf ſome nerves from elſewhere, and ſends forth others from it ſelf into the neighbouring parts, this infolding, as it were a knot in the ſtem of a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Tree, is made, that it may be as it were a diverting place for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold tendency of the Spirits. As to the adventitious Nerves it is obſerved, That by them plenty of ſubſidiary Spirits are tranſmitted hither, only from the ſpinal Marrow, but by a manifold and frequent paſſage; wherefore in this infolding, and again in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:152521:188"/>
the following, then a little lower, nigh the ſeveral junctures of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebral branch comes to either Trunk of the intercoſtal pair: this ſeems to be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for many uſes. Firſt, That the intercoſtal Nerve, by the reiterated faſtening to the ſolid parts, as it were by a frequent ſtay, might become the more firm for the making of a long journey, when otherwiſe its little rope, by too much ſtretching out, might be eaſily broken. Secondly, By this means it comes to paſs, that the nerves which are the Executors of the ſpontaneous, and thoſe of the involuntary Function, might have both a more certain commerce together, and might be ſometimes excited into mutual ſuccors. Hence Reſpiration and ſome other Acts, eſpecially what concerns the Act of <hi>Venus,</hi> participate of either Regiment, ſo that ſometimes they follow the will, and ſometimes draw it even by force or unwilling. Further, when at any time the ſtock of animal Spirits is deficient in either Province, ſupplies of them are ſought from the other: to wit, (as we hinted above) if the influence towards the <hi>Praecordia</hi> be ſhut up through the ordinary paſſages, <hi>viz.</hi> the internal nerves, their paſſages requiſite for the ſuſtaining of life, might be ſupplied by the Vertebral branches: yea it is probable in the partial <hi>Apoplexie,</hi> and in the <hi>Incubus</hi> or Night-mare, when the Cerebel being affected, the Spirits deſtinated for the Heart, ſuffer an Eclipſe in the Fountain it ſelf, that through theſe Emiſſaries, to wit, the Vertebral branches inſerted into the intercoſtal pair, ſome extemporary Subſidies are carried for the actuating the Heart. Thirdly, The Vertebral branches by ſo frequent an inſertion, are added to the intercoſtal nerve, perchance in ſome reſpect for this end alſo, that the ſuperfluous or excrementitious humidities, heaped together about the ſpinal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, might be ſent away by theſe Proceſſes: for indeed we have already ſhewn, that a certain humor doth abound within the Head, the medullar Appendix, and nervous Syſtem; which oftentimes (when it becomes watry, or abounds above meaſure) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a ſerous heap in thoſe parts: wherefore when the branches of the intercoſtal nerve are terminated into the Meſentery, Kidneys, Inteſtines, and ſome Genital parts, it is probable they do transfer into theſe ſinks ſuperfluous humidities, not only their own, but alſo of another ſort, to wit, thoſe received from the ſpinal Nerves.</p>
                           <p>As to the Nerves, which as Emiſſaries, are carried from the aforeſaid Ganglioform infolding into other parts, we obſerve; firſt, that a noted ſhoot is carried from hence into the Sphincter of the Throat, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. γ. This nerve in the Sphincter of the Throat correſponds with others akin, ariſing higher from the fifth pair, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed into the parts of the Palate and Mouth, and is helpful to them in the buſineſs of chewing: for when the maxillar branches of the fifth pair ſhould perform their work for the chewing of the food taken in, the task of this nerve mediately ariſing alſo from the fifth pair, follows, to wit, whereby the Throat being opened, the chewed meats may be thruſt forward into its paſſage.</p>
                           <p>Another ſhoot is ſtretched out from this infolding into a like infolding of the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring pair placed near, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. α. The reaſon of this inſertion is delivered above, where we treat of the wandring Pair. But it may be obſerved further concerning this; when ſo nigh a communication happens between theſe infoldings; and when ſhoots are ſent from one of them into the Muſcles of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> and from another into the Muſcles of the Throat, from hence we may give a reaſon, why in Hyſterick diſtempers and in ſome Hypochondriacal there is ſo frequent and familiar a Symptom of the ſenſe of choaking in the Throat. For a Cramp or Convulſion being begun in any nerve, it is wont to creep forward further by the paſſage of the ſame, and ſo to invade ſometimes theſe parts, ſometimes thoſe ſucceſſively. If therefore at any time a Spaſm ariſes any where in any nerve of the wandring or intercoſtal pair, and from thence tending upwards or downwards, ſhall come to either infolding, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently both being affected, and the Muſcles of the whole neighbourhood being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, a bulk or Tumor like a Globe or round thing in the Throat is excited with a ſenſe of choaking.</p>
                           <p>The intercoſtal Nerve deſcending a little lower, contains in the neck another greater infolding proper to man, to which a noted Vertebral nerve is inſerted alſo, out of which many nerves deſtinated to the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> are ſent forth on either ſide, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>Τ.</hi> As to the principal parts, to wit, the Brain and Heart, there is no ſuch great difference between a Man and a Brute, as there is about the paſſage of one to the other, or the commerce that thoſe parts have mutually among themſelves. In either kind, for the exerciſe of the vital Function, the animal Spirits are derived
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:152521:189"/>
from the Head, with a conſtant emanation into the Heart; to which ſort of influence of theirs the paſſage of the wandring pair of nerves ſeems ſufficient: wherefore in moſt Brutes the paſſage to the Heart and its Appendix lyes open only by this way, and ſcarce at all by any nerves of the intercoſtal pair. But in Man the intercoſtal nerve, beſides its offices in the lower Belly, common to him with other Animals, ſerves in the place of a ſpecial Internuncius alſo before the Cloiſter of the Breaſt, which bears the mutual ſenſes of the Brain and Heart this way and that way, or to and fro. For when, beſides the nerves of the wandring pair, ſtretched out alſo into the humane <hi>Praecordia,</hi> (which certainly ſeem ſufficient for the executing of the offices of the Function merely vital) ſo many noted branches are ſent forth from the aforeſaid intercoſtal infolding, what kind of office ſhould be attributed to theſe, unleſs that they ſhould contain the animal Spirits, by whoſe work and miniſtry the mutual reſpects and affections of the Brain and Heart ſhould be communicated to one another? Whilſt I conſider this difference of either kind, it comes into my mind, that Brutes are like Machines framed with a more ſimple furniture and with leſs workmanſhip, and therefore furniſhed with a motion of one kind only, or determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the doing ſtill the ſame thing. But in Man divers ſeries of motions, and as it were complications of wheels within wheels, appear. For indeed, by the paſſage of the aforeſaid infolding, the conceptions of the Brain preſently affect the Heart and its Veſſels, and cauſe the reſt of the Appendix, together with the Diaphragma, to be moved. Hence the motion of the blood and its inkindling in the Heart, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Pulſe and Reſpiration, are altered: and for that cauſe, from the Heart being altered, not only impreſſions are retorted upon the Brain by the paſſage of the ſame nerves, but alſo the blood it ſelf, its courſe being changed, drives to the Brain with a different or unaccuſtomed fluctuation, and ſo by moving the animal Spirits with various impulſes, cauſes firſt one ſort of conceptions, and then others to be produced: and ſo by reaſon of theſe reciprocal affections of the Heart and Brain, which are wont by a long ſeries to be propagated viciſſively, a multiplicity of thoughts and Phantaſms ariſes. Hence both the ancient Divines and Philoſophers placed wiſdom in the Heart. Certainly the Works of Prudence and Vertue depend very much on the mutual commerce which happens to the Heart with the Brain: becauſe, that cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations about the acts of the Appetite or Judgment may be rightly deſcribed, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveful for the flood of the blood to be reſtrained in the Breaſt, and the inordinations of it and of the Heart it ſelf to be governed by the Nerves, as it were by Reins, and to be compoſed into requiſite and apt motions. We might ſay more concerning this, but that this Speculation is from our purpoſe, and belongs more properly to Patho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy or the Doctrine of the Paſſions of the Soul. In the mean time, we may refer hither one or two Obſervations taken from <hi>Anatomy.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>When of late we had diſſected the Carcaſs of a man that was a Fool from his birth, we could find no defect or fault in the Brain, unleſs that its ſubſtance or bulk was very ſmall. But the chief note of difference which we obſerved between the parts of this man and of a man of judgment, was this, That the aforeſaid infolding of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal Nerve, which we call the <hi>Internuncius</hi> of the Brain and Heart, proper to man, was very ſmall in this Fool, and beſet with a weaker guard of Nerves.</p>
                           <p>Whilſt we were writing theſe, we made an Anatomy of a Monkey, whoſe Brain differed little from that which is ſeen in a Dog or a Fox, unleſs that it was much more capacious in the proportion to the bulk of his Body, and the turnings and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of it were larger. The orbicular Prominences called <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Teſtes,</hi> alſo the ringy Protuberance, ſent down from the Cerebel, came nearer the figure and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of thoſe parts in a man. But what occurred chiefly worthy noting, was this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the intercoſtal Nerve, although even as it is wont to be in other Brutes, being included in the ſame ſheath with the Trunk of the eighth pair, was carried through the Neck, yet departing from this Nerve near the Chanel-bone, before it was inſerted into the infolding, placed nigh the roots of the upper Ribs, did ſend forth ſome ſhoots into the Heart and its Appendix, and certain Fibres into the nerve of the Diaphragma: which perhaps partly is the reaſon, why this Animal is ſo craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and mimical above other Beaſts, and can ſo aptly ſhew and imitate, not only the geſtures, but the paſſions and ſome manners of a Man. But we will proceed to the explication of the intercoſtal Nerve from whence we have digreſſed.</p>
                           <p>We have already intimated for what uſe the Vertebral branch is inſerted into its cervical infolding. There is the ſame reaſon for this as for the other Vertebrals,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:152521:189"/>
which communicate with the intercoſtal Nerve almoſt in its whole paſſage. But for that the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is radicated in the ſame Vertebral nerve, from whence a branch comes into this infolding, I ſay from that a reaſon may be taken, why the motion of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> intimately conſpires with the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> yea and with the conceptions of the Brain: which kind of Sympathy of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> with the other parts, becauſe it is requiſite to be more ſtrict and noted in man, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, That not only the Vertebral branch cometh between the infolding and the root of the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> but two and ſometimes three nerves are ſent from this infolding into the trunk it ſelf of the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma, Fig.</hi> 9 <hi>ε. ε.</hi> Truly from hence not only the joynt action or <hi>Sympraxis</hi> of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> with the <hi>Praecordia</hi> may be derived; but alſo the genuine cauſe is here manifeſt, why Riſibility is a proper Affection of a man. For as often as the Imagination is affected by any pleaſant or wonderful conception, preſently the Heart deſires to rejoyce, and as it were by ſhaking off its load to be eaſed: wherefore that the blood might be more ſwiftly emptied out of its right boſom into the Lungs, and conſequently out of the left into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> inſtigated by the paſſage of the nerves going out of this infolding, is drawn upward by a more rapid <hi>Syſtole,</hi> and raiſes up the Lungs, as it were making iterated leaps, and cauſes them, by their more frequent ſtriking together, to drive out both the Air and the blood. Then foraſmuch as the ſame intercoſtal Nerve, which communicates lower with the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> is continued alſo higher with the maxillary Nerves, a cackling being made in the Breaſt, with it the geſture of the Mouth and Face pathetically anſwers.</p>
                           <p>One or two noted ſhoots and many nervous Fibres are carried from this infolding into the returning Nerve, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>ζ.</hi> Certainly the reaſon of this communication ſeems to be, that the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and the Heart it ſelf (into which nerves are ſent from this infolding) might yet more conſpire with the rough Artery (which the returning nerve affects) in its various actions, and eſpecially in laughing, weeping, and ſinging. Moreover, when the returning Nerves, by pulling upwards the Trunks of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> cauſe the blood, for the ſtirring up ſome Affections, to creep more ſwiftly towards the Head, they may in the performing that office be much helped by the aſſociate labour of the Nerves ſent from this infolding.</p>
                           <p>From this infolding in the Neck many ſmall fibres and ſhoots are ſpread into the ſanguiferous Veſſels, as alſo into the Coats of the <hi>Trachea</hi> and the <hi>Oeſophagus, Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>ibid.</hi> As to what belongs to the former that reſpect the <hi>Trachea</hi> and the blood-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Veſſels; their office is, that they may reſpectively draw together and ſpread abroad thoſe chanels of inſpired and exſpired blood and Air, according to the way and manner wherewith the Pulſe and Breathing ought to be performed; whereby the motions of either might be the better retarded or accelerated, according to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities or requirings of the Heart. Then numerous Fibres are ſtretched out from this infolding into the Coats of the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> placed near, that by this means the admirable conſent between the Heart and the Stomach, by reaſon of the Nerves being reached forth from this infolding and from the wandring pair to both, may be produced.</p>
                           <p>Concerning the Cardiack branches ſent from this infolding, we need not diſcourſe any more: after having but now intimated, that theſe were as it were <hi>Internuncii</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to men, which carrying to and fro the reciprocal impreſſions of the Brain and Heart, cauſe Commerces in both Kingdoms. But foraſmuch as Nerves of a double kind, <hi>viz.</hi> of the wandring and intercoſtal pair, reſpect the humane <hi>Praecordia,</hi> leſt the geſtures of one ſhould be different from thoſe of the other, therefore the <hi>Cardiack</hi> branches, which are of either family, partly communicate in the ſame infolding, and are partly inoculated mutually by ſhoots ſent forth before they are diſtributed into the Heart it ſelf.</p>
                           <p>Below the Cervical infolding, the intercoſtal Trunk being demerſed within the <hi>Thorax,</hi> admits three Vertebral Nerves ariſing higher, and conſtitutes the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding, which is commonly called the Intercoſtal, but more properly the <hi>Thoracical</hi> infolding, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. Τ. In this place the intercoſtal Nerve being about to paſs into its laſt and more large Province, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the lower Belly, and therefore ſeeking aid for the journey, and as it were a <hi>Viaticum</hi> for it ſelf, it gets together in this infolding an increaſe or aiding forces from the Vertebral nerves, and afterwards receives lower others freſh nigh the ſeveral knots of the <hi>Vertebrae;</hi> becauſe it will have need of a great ſtock of Spirits, which it muſt beſtow on the Meſenterick infoldings, and on other parts of the <hi>Abdomen.</hi>

                              <pb n="164" facs="tcp:152521:190"/>That this Nerve about to enter the Thoracical infolding, doth bind the Chanel-bone Artery, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>l.</hi> and that the ſuperior branch of the Vertebral, being ſent into the ſame infolding, doth bind about the Vertebral Artery, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. π. the reaſon of both ſeems, that the blood, for the uſes and neceſſities of the lower <hi>Viſcera</hi> (to which the intercoſtal Nerve from thence ſerves) may be driven forward with a more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful afflux downwards: which thing thoſe Nerves eaſily do by pulling together the blood-carrying Veſſels towards their infolding; ſo that they attempt this ſnatching of the blood in oppoſition to that which the returning Nerves perform. And indeed when the blood, tending upwards and downwards, is wont ſometimes to flow too much towards either bound, ſometimes to be wanting; therefore the nerves, as it were an incitement or remora, are variouſly diſpoſed both in the upper and lower re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Circuit about the ſanguiferous Veſſels. After what manner this Thora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cical infolding is in brute Beaſts, ſhall be particularly ſhewn hereafter. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal Nerve in a Man, both in this infolding and in the whole deſcent through the <hi>Thorax,</hi> receives many Vertebral nerves, as if ſparing of its own ſtock, and greedy of anothers, but ſends forth from it ſelf not a ſhoot: whatever of Spirits is remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either from the influence above, or comes to it by the by, is reſerved wholly for a largeſs to be beſtowed on the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the lower Belly. But after what manner, and by what paſſages of nerves that is diſpenſed into the ſeveral parts, we will unfold in the following Chapter.</p>

Of the infoldings which are on the left ſide, one reſpects the Kidney, and the other the Ventricle with the Spleen; but of thoſe which are on the oppoſite ſide, one reſpects the right Kidney, and the other the Liver and its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring part. In the midſt of theſe, the infolding proper to the <hi>Meſentery</hi> and the biggeſt, is placed as the Sun among the other <hi>Planets.</hi> Further, from theſe are ſent forth one to another and into the neighbouring parts numerous Fibres very thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it were dartings of rays. <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. plainly ſhews all theſe.</p>
                           <p>Concerning theſe, in the firſt place, it ſhall be inquired into in general, For what end ſo many nervous infoldings, with almoſt innumerable fibres and ſhoots, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed about the Meſentery and the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the <hi>Abdomen.</hi> For when in theſe parts the fibres and nervous ſhoots are carried on every ſide with ſo thick a ſeries, that they are variouſly infolded with their manifold meeting, it may ſeem wonderful, if every one of theſe be deſtinated to ſome uſes, and are not rather ſprinkled here and there by chance, and as it were by the inconſiderate ſporting of Nature. And indeed any one can ſcarce think, that ſo many Veſſels ſhould be prepared for the performing the offices of motion or ſenſe in that place. For thoſe <hi>Viſcera,</hi> unleſs highly pulled and affected with a Convulſion, are ſenſible of little or nothing that we know of; and their motions are almoſt no other thing than obſcure Vermiculations or light Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, ſo that for the effecting them there is required no greater preparation than for the ſlow progreſs of a Snail. Wherefore from hence it hath come into the mind of ſome, that a certain Juyce, and that perhaps nutritious, was diſpenſed by this mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold paſſage of the nervous Pipes: which ſort of office however if aſſigned to theſe Fibres diſperſed about the Meſentery, why ſhould not the ſame office either of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving or of carrying of nouriſhment, be granted to thoſe in like manner divaricated about the Lungs and the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and eſpecially about the rough <hi>Artery?</hi> But truly
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:152521:190"/>
it is highly improbable, that a nutritious Juyce ſhould be contained in the Coats of the <hi>Trachea</hi> or of the <hi>Bronchia,</hi> which the nerves may ſuck out; nor does it more clearly appear, why more nerves ſhould be deſtinated for the carrying of the alible Juyce to theſe parts of the Abdomen, or thoſe of the Breaſt, than is needful for the muſculous ſtock. But in the mean time, though we deny, that the whole nutritious matter is carried this way and that way by thoſe or the other nerves; yet we think, that within thoſe nervous paſſages an humor doth perpetually abound, which may be for a Vehicle of the animal Spirits, and a Ferment for the nutritious matter: with which going with the nervous humor towards the Inteſtines and to the other ſinks of the Body, it is likely, that the ſuperfluous and excrementitious ſeroſities do often ſlide down together, and ſo are carried out.</p>
                           <p>But it may be well thought, as to the Meſenterick Nerves, and Infoldings in which they are terminated, and the Fibres moſt thickly going out of theſe, that theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner of Veſſels are firſt Chanels, then Storehouſes, and laſtly the laſt Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the animal Spirits. If it ſhould be demanded, for what end ſo great plenty of Spirits ſhould be deſigned for theſe ignobler parts; I ſay, that this is done for the performing the acts of Motion and Senſe there, which are highly neceſſary for the preſerving of life it ſelf. For although local motion, which is always performed by the help of a Muſcle, as of a Spring, is not convenient for the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the lower Belly; yet inteſtine motions are brought forth by them almoſt continually, and after many faſhions: <hi>viz.</hi> for the ſubduing the Chyle, alſo for the ſeparation of ſome parts and particles from others, both of that, and alſo of the bloody Liquor, and the protruſion of every one towards their deſigned bounds, the Fibres and nervous ſhoots reaching into the Membranes of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> and the Coats of the Veſſels, yea and into the textures of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> are variouſly drawn together, to wit, theſe are pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upwards, thoſe downwards; ſometimes many together, ſometimes apart or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, are wont to be drawn hither and thither. In truth, it is a ſign of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcontinued action of theſe <hi>Viſcera,</hi> that as well in ſleep, and perhaps more than in waking, the Culinary work of Nutrition is performed; and whilſt the Organs of the other Faculties are at reſt, there is no quiet granted to theſe: but that the Meſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick nerves perpetually grinding in the Mill, are always buſied for the preparing the alible humor and the exporting the ſame towards all parts.</p>
                           <p>Moreover in theſe parts, to which the aforeſaid Nerves belong, there is found an exquiſite feeling no leſs than a motive Faculty; for whatſoever heterogeneous or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing, mixed with the Chyle or blood, is brought to any <hi>Viſcera,</hi> preſently the Spirits, inhabiting thoſe parts, being warned of the evil, do greatly tumultuate as it were by entring into a Conſpiracy, that what is hoſtile or troubleſom they might ſhut out. But indeed, becauſe the animal Spirits, flowing by the paſſage of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal nerve to the Inteſtines and <hi>Viſcera</hi> akin to them, proceed from the Cerebel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore the buſineſſes of either Faculty, to wit, both the ſenſitive and locomotive, foraſmuch as they are performed the Brain unconſulted, and the animal ſcarce know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, are not ſo openly taken notice of, and for that reaſon they are accounted of leſs than the ſpontaneous acts of the other parts.</p>
                           <p>But as to the manner it ſelf or way of the oeconomy, whereby the animal Spirits, deſtinated to the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the lower Belly, are exerciſed, we affirm, That plenty of them flow into all the Meſentetick infoldings by the paſſage of the nerves ſent from the intercoſtal pair; where being heaped up to a fulneſs, as it were in ſo many Store-houſes or places of Receipt, they are kept to be diſtributed from thence into ſeveral parts, as occaſion requires. But that the Spirits flow out of theſe infoldings, not through ſingular and larger branches, (as is done in the Muſcles) but as it were by Troops of Fibres, into their proper tasks, the reaſon is, becauſe here the buſineſs is performed otherwiſe than in the muſculous ſtock. For where a Muſcle is fixed to the part to be moved, its implanted Fibres perform the whole work of Contraction, or of the motive endeavour; but it ſuffices for the nerve ſtill to convey new ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Spirits, and as occaſion ſerves, the Inſtincts of the Motion to be performed: but in the Membranes and the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> where Muſcles are wanting, the nervous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres themſelves moſt thickly implanted, and diſtributed as it were ſo many little ropes, almoſt into every part of the ſubject, perform the buſineſs of Traction or drawing by themſelves and their own proper endeavour or force partly; and partly ſolicite or ſtir up into motion the Fibres implanted in the <hi>Viſcera</hi> diſpoſed after an uncertain order; which they determinate in their action, and moderate or govern
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:152521:191"/>
them, as it were ſo many fingers laid upon the ſtrings of a muſical Inſtrument. For although the Membranes and the <hi>Viſcera</hi> themſelves are indued with ſome implanted Fibres; yet theſe are not, as it is in the Muſcles, of one kind and poſition; but in the ſame part ſome are ſtraight, and others oblique or crooked, theſe tend upwards, thoſe downwards, and others are carried round; ſo that divers ſorts of motions ought to be performed in the ſame Membrane or Inward, ſometimes together, ſometimes ſucceſſively or by turns: wherefore diſtinct nerves are required, not only for the ſeveral ſeries of Fibres, but for all the parts of the ſubject, to wit, which may ſtop here a motion begun in that place, and may begin another anew, or may unite one with another. Truly the motion which is performed in the muſculous ſtock ſeems like the rude and more ſimple work of ſome Weaver, where the ſhuttle being always caſt after the ſame manner, the Woof is laid under the Thread or Yarn: but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Inteſtines and <hi>Viſcera</hi> may be aptly compared to a Texture very much variegated or flouriſhed, for the weaving of whoſe more artificial ſubſtance or making there is made uſe of many hands together, or of a Machine diverſly turning about, and furniſhed with more than a thouſand ſorts of motions.</p>
                           <p>Concerning the many Meſenterick Nerves, and Shoots, and nervous Fibres which go out of them by bands, we muſt conſider chiefly theſe two things: to wit, what may be the office of each of them for the ſtirring up of motion or ſenſe, either of them, or both together in any part: then ſecondly, what the communication of either of them may be with other nerves, infoldings or bundles of nerves, by reaſon of which a Sympathy or conſent of actions ariſes at once in divers parts. According to theſe two reſpects we will particularly weigh now the ſeveral nervous Veſſels belonging to the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the lower Belly.</p>
                           <p>Therefore in the left ſide the ſupreme Meſenterick branch being preſently forked like the figure of the Letter Y, contains in its upper ſhoot the Stomachical infolding, which is alſo the Splenetick, and in the other lower the Renal infolding or that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Reins. Moreover, about the knot of diviſion it ſends forth ſome ſhoots to the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>F. G.</hi> Hence a reaſon is plain, wherefore there happens ſuch affinity between the Ventricle and the Spleen, and between the Meſentery and the Reins, ſo that the very often and familiar Symptom of Vomiting is both in Splenetick, Colical, and Nephritick people: becauſe when a Convulſion is begun in any part or Inward, which the Meſenterick nerve reſpects, preſently other parts, to which the infoldings or ſhoots of the ſame nerve belong, are drawn into conſent.</p>
                           <p>From this lower infolding a little bundle of Nerves being carried towards the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, inſerts its Fibres partly in its bottom, and partly ſends them to meet with other Fibres ſent down from the nerve of the Stomach, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>n.</hi> The reaſon of the former is, That whereas there are many Coats of the Ventricle, and divers ſeries of Fibres are diſpoſed in them, for the actuating all of which with a due influx of animal Spirits, the Stomachical nerves, derived from the wandring pair, are not ſufficient; it was fit, that for the outward Court as it were or Precinct of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to wit, for the outmoſt bottom of it, ſome forces of Spirits might be ſupplied from ſome ſtrange Kingdom, to wit, from the aforeſaid nervous infolding of the Abdomen. Inſtead of this, Spirits alſo may ſlide downwards from the ſame Stoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical branch through other Fibres ſent down, and be ſent into this Splenetick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding. Beſides alſo it is obſerved, That the adventitious nerves aptly conſpire with the former, being of the proper dominion of the Ventricle, and that either are not only inoculated within the confines of the Inward it ſelf, but they run into mutual embraces without it, and as it were joyn hands together.</p>
                           <p>It ſeems plain, that the nervous Filaments being carried from the aforeſaid infold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the bottom of the Ventricle, may ſerve there for the performing the acts of Motion and Senſation: but it doth not ſo eaſily appear with what office the other handful of Fibres reaching out from hence into the Spleen is charged (<hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>ζ.</hi>) becauſe this Inward is ſaid to be deſtitute wholly of every animal Faculty. When we did elſewhere inquire into the uſe of the Spleen, we thought good to affirm, That its office was to ſeparate the dregs of the Blood and the acid-ſaline Particles, and whatſoever were of a more fixed nature, and to concoct them more being received into its own boſom, and to convert them into an acid Ferment; by which being again delivered to the blood through the Veins, a ſharpneſs and an aſperity, as alſo an active or fermentative virtue are gotten for its <hi>Latex.</hi> Wherefore the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:152521:191"/>
of the Spleen conſiſts of a texture of Fibres in the form of a net; to wit, that the Feculencies of the blood might be more plentifully received, and contained within its ſpongy cavities and thick paſſages. I ſay therefore, that for the fit preſerving and diſpenſing of the Splenetick Ferment, beſides the Arteries which carry matter, and the Veins which continually ſup back ſome portion of the ſame fermented, there ſeems to be need of many nerves alſo, which both by pulling the fibrous texture of the Spleen, might cauſe the melancholick and dark <hi>Faeces,</hi> laid up in it, to be ſhaken together, and ſo by defending it from putrefaction and coagulation, cauſe it to be imbued with an acid and fermentative nature; and alſo that thoſe nerves may ſometimes draw together and conſtrain the blood-carrying Veſſels, ſometimes open and inlarge them; that as occaſion ſerves, the Feculencies of the blood may be ſometimes more plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſometimes more ſparingly laid aſide out of the Arteries into the Spleen, alſo that more or leſs of the Ferment, preſerved in the Spleen, may be poured out on the blood according to the requirings of the Paſſions or of the natural Inſtinct. No Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriack but doth abundantly perceive, that ſome Splenetick nerves do perform motions; for thoſe great perturbations which are wont to be excited in the left ſide, as when ſometimes Inflations, ſometimes conſtrictions of the inward parts, and ſometimes various concuſſions are perceived with a wandring pain running here and there, they are only Spaſms or Convulſions or wrinklings together, with which the nerves of the Spleen are ordinarily affected. Nor do its nerves, taken with a Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſtir up tumults only in the neighbourhood of the Spleen, but oftentimes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Heart it ſelf, yea into the whole Body the effects of their inordinations are carried. I have known an Hypochondriack, who preſently upon the Spleen being diſturbed, ſeemed to have his <hi>Praecordia,</hi> being drawn downwards, to be cruelly preſt and bound together; ſo that being very ſad and dejected in his mind, alſo complaining of an exceeding great ſtraitneſs and conſtriction of his Breaſt, he thought himſelf almoſt dead. The cauſe of which kind of diſtemper was without doubt, that when many Fibres going out of the Splenetick infolding are united with other Fibres ſent from the fartheſt end of the wandring pair, it eaſily happens, that the former, being diſtempered with the Convulſion, do draw together and pull downwards their yoke-fellows, and by conſequence the Trunk it ſelf of the wandring pair, from which the nerves are ſent into the <hi>Praecordia:</hi> certainly by the <hi>Sympraxis</hi> or joynt action of either kind of the aforeſaid nerves, <hi>viz.</hi> whereof theſe reſpect the Spleen, thoſe the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> it is effected, that the Trembling, Oppreſſion, and other grievous Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the Heart, as alſo of the Spleen, ſo ordinarily happen. Further, foraſmuch as the Fermentation of the blood depends on the Spleen, according to the influence of this, that performs its Circulation, ſometimes pleaſantly, ſometimes diſturbedly. Whilſt the Spleen is at quiet, and free from any perturbation, the blood alſo is quietly moved in Hypochondriacal perſons; but if the ſame be moved and exerciſed, (as it is wont to be in any paſſion or violent motion of the Body, or by a Medicine) preſently its nerves being diſtempered with a Convulſion, ſhake it more with reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated contractions; ſo that the fermentative Feculencies, being ſhaken out of its boſom, flow back more plentifully into the blood, which cauſe its <hi>Latex</hi> preſently to be troubled, and as it were muddy, and ſharpen it with ſo great acrimony and mordacity, that it burns and pricks the Brain and Heart like needles; from whence in Splenetick people, beſides that the Reaſon is obſcured, the affections of the Mind, eſpecially Sadneſs, Hatred, and Anger are very much increaſed.</p>
                           <p>Concerning the Splenetick Nerves, by another conjecture, we are yet brought to believe, that they, beſides the exerciſe of the motive Faculty, do both inſtil into the Spleen its own humor, which promotes the fermentative virtue of that Inward; and alſo (becauſe the nerves, as was ſhewn already, convey the Spirits, and ſometimes the humors by either way, <hi>viz.</hi> forward and backward) the ſame implanted in the Spleen, do often imbibe from it an acetous or Vinegar-like humor, and as it were Vitriolick, from whoſe acrimony and notable twitching, they are forced into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions.</p>
                           <p>But foraſmuch as the nervous Infolding reſpecting the Spleen, communicates more nearly with the Ventricle, Meſentery, Liver, and Kidneys, and more remotely with the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and other parts placed at a diſtance; from hence the cauſe is plain, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not only theſe ſeveral <hi>Viſcera</hi> and parts, by reaſon of the fault of the Spleen, are folded together; but alſo on the contrary, why the Spleen being indiſpoſed by any Diſeaſe, or trouble raiſed up in any of thoſe parts, is wont to be diſturbed: ſo it is
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:152521:192"/>
not altogether for nothing, that the Symptoms every where infeſting, the cauſe of them being unknown, are aſcribed ordinarily to the Spleen; becauſe it fixes not only its own inordinations in other parts, but alſo ſuffers for their peculiar faults: which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is wrongfully aſcribed to Vapours tranſmitted from this or that part, when the formal reaſon of every Diſtemper of this kind for the moſt part conſiſts in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication made through the Nerves.</p>
                           <p>The lower Infolding of the left ſide ſeems to be made for the Kidney placed near, into which chiefly the bundle of its Fibres is carried, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. ♃. γ. γ. Certainly that theſe nerves, following the emulgent Veſſels, do embrace the ſame, and bind them about with a various and frequent complication; that is ſo made for that end, that by reaſon of the Artery being ſo ſtrained and frequently ſhaken by the drawings of the nerves, the Serum may the more eaſily be precipitated from the blood: wherefore it is obſerved in very great difficulty or danger, when the mind and all the nerves are ſtrained for fear, that a frequent and more plentiful making of water, and that often painful, is wont to be provoked.</p>
                           <p>The Renal Infolding receives, beſides the Nerve common to it with the upper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding, another new and peculiar one from the intercoſtal nerve, or rather that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming between from the ſpinal Marrow, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. β. Hence it is, that the Loyns have a great conſent with the Reins, and ſuffer ſo ordinarily for their Diſtempers with a grievous and largely diffuſive pain. Foraſmuch as this infolding communicates with the greateſt of the Meſentery, the Colick diſtemper and the Nephritick are much akin, and it is often difficult to diſtinguiſh their fits one from the other.</p>
                           <p>The Meſenterick branch in the right ſide, as well as the left, being forked, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains two infoldings: the upper of theſe (which we call the Hepatick) ſends forth from it ſelf many little bundles of nervous Fibres; the greateſt of which being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried towards the Liver, cloaths the Hepatick Artery as it were with a Net made of Fibres, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>♂. o.</hi> The moſt Learned <hi>Gliſſon</hi> obſerves, That the Hepatick Artery is beſtowed on the Trunks of the Veſſels, to wit, of the common Cheſt, of the bilary Pore, and of the <hi>Vena Porta;</hi> for the watering of which, and for the actuating them with heat and nouriſhing Juyce, it carries the arterious Blood; to which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding for the recarrying, an aſſociate Vein is wholly wanting: wherefore that ought to carry the blood, not with a full and free influx, but by little and little, and always in a conſtant meaſure to thoſe membranaceous parts: for otherwiſe there had been danger, leſt from the bloody <hi>Latex</hi> plentifully ruſhing forward, for that it could not be ſtill remanded preſently through the Veins, an Inflammation ſhould be excited, or leſt from its torrent being transfuſed beyond its banks, the courſes of the other rivers in the Liver ſhould be diſturbed. But for that the nerves, like Reins, do bind about the Trunk of the Artery, the inflowing of the blood it ſelf is moderated, and they cauſe it variouſly to be diſpenſed according to the wants of thoſe parts to which it is deſtinated.</p>
                           <p>From the Troop of Nerves going out towards the Liver, ſome bend down into the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> and others into the <hi>Cholidock</hi> Veſſels, <hi>Duodenum,</hi> and <hi>Pylorus,</hi> and ſow into them thick ſeries of ſhoots, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. π. π. The office of theſe ſeems to be, to pull together the excretory paſſages of thoſe parts, and to ſhake them for the cauſing Evacuations of the boiling or turging humors upon occaſion. Further, from theſe Fibres being carried upwards, when many others ſent from either Stomachical nerve are united, the reaſon is plain, why from an hawling or pulling made about the Ventricle, the yellow Bile is drawn out of the Gall-cheſt into the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> which being carried from thence into the Ventricle, by reaſon of a Convulſion of that ſame Inteſtine, is caſt up by Vomit: becauſe the Stomachical nerves being irritated by a Medicine, or by any troubleſom thing, for the making an Evacuation above, and for that cauſe drawn from thence upwards, they draw together the nerves belonging to the Liver and the <hi>Cholidock</hi> Veſſels, for that they are tied to them, and bring them into conſent with the ſuperior Spaſm or Convulſion. Hence it happens, that not only the Stomach being firſt tired, draws to it ſelf the Bile by its Convulſion, and allures it into its own boſom; but the Bile alſo of its own accord growing turgid, and ſo being poured out into the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> foraſmuch as it irritates the nerves of this Inteſtine, and then by their conſent, provokes the nervous Veſſels of the Ventricle, it preſently induces a cholerick Vomiting.</p>
                           <p>The Hepatick Infolding communicates with the Splenetick by Fibres going between either, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. τ. The reaſon of which ſeems to be, That when one infolding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:152521:192"/>
the end or the right extremity of the Ventricle, and another the left; that a conſent in either and a joynt action may be made towards the Stomach, both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate between themſelves by nerves, as if <hi>Internuntii.</hi> Truly it ſeems to come to paſs by the paſſage of theſe nerves, that the <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> pains oftentimes run from the left ſide into the right; to wit, for that a Spaſm or Convulſion begun in the Sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick infolding, is wont to be carried to the Hepatick.</p>
                           <p>Between the <hi>Hepatick</hi> Infolding and the greateſt of the <hi>Meſentery,</hi> many Fibres reaching out by bands, are caſt out in the midſt, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>p. p.</hi> the office of which is to ſuſtain a certain commerce and Sympathy; to wit, ſuch an one is required, both that the Chyle may be miniſtred from the Inteſtines towards the Liver ſtill in due proportion, alſo that the Bile may opportunely ſlide out from the Gall-bladder into the Inteſtines for the provoking of Excretion. For we are of this Opinion, That the Meſeraick Veins ſucking out a certain portion of the Chyle from the Inteſtines, immediately transfer it through the region of the Liver into the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> whereby the blood in the aſcending Trunk of the hollow Vein or <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> might be freſhly imbued with nouriſhing Juyce; even as in its deſcending Trunk it is refreſhed, the ſame being poured out through the <hi>Thoracical</hi> Veſſels or thoſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Thorax.</hi> Wherefore it is needful, that there ſhould be a very ſtrict affinity between theſe <hi>Viſcera;</hi> and the rather, becauſe the Bile ought to be poured out from the Gall cheſt to the Inteſtines, not continually, but for ſome uſes, by occaſions and intervals. For the Nerves knowing beſt the wants of either part, warn them both of their mutual duty, and as occaſion ſerves, ſtir them into action.</p>
                           <p>It is obſerved, That in the right ſide an ample Nerve is ſtretched out between the <hi>Hepatick</hi> and <hi>Renal</hi> infolding, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. μ. So that between theſe infoldings a greater and more immediate conſent is had, than between thoſe pairs of the other ſide. The reaſon of which doth not eaſily appear, unleſs perhaps it ſhould be ſo made for this end, that when from the Reins, in making of water, there is an endeavour of the ſerous Excretion, the <hi>Pylorus</hi> and the <hi>Cholidock</hi> Veſſels being at once drawn down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, a protruſion of the Chyle and <hi>Faeces</hi> might be provoked towards the lower parts of the Belly. Certainly this connexion of theſe infoldings is chiefly the cauſe, why oftentimes moſt cruel Vomiting uſes to come upon a Fit of the Stone; and that from ſuch a Vomiting the <hi>Cholidock</hi> Veſſels are very much emptied, as if provoked by taking an Emetick.</p>
                           <p>The greateſt Infolding of the Meſentery being placed in the midſt of the reſt, like the Sun, diſperſes every where round about nervous Fibres like rays, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. ☉. and caſts them not only on every one of thoſe infoldings, as if ſo many Planets with a peculiar Aſpect, or <hi>Actinoboliſm</hi> or Irradiation, but alſo it diſtributes them into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inteſtines, ſanguiferous Veſſels, and other parts lying round about: without doubt upon theſe nervous Filaments, which are carried from this infolding to the Inteſtines, as Lines from the Centre to the Circumference, every action of the Inteſtines, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Periſtaltick motion of the Vermiculation, depends; namely for that theſe Fibres do move ſucceſſively, and ſtill move further every begun action, as it were with a ſpiral or Screw-like progreſs.</p>
                           <p>That from this Infolding many Fibres and ſhoots going forth, are inſerted into the Trunk of the <hi>Aorta</hi> nigh its deſcending, and that theſe reaching towards the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, accompany the Blood-carrying Veſſels, and in ſeveral places climb over them; from hence it may be inferred, That nerves alſo in the Abdomen are like Bridles and Reins caſt on the ſanguiferous Veſſels, which either by ſtraining or pulling them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, may ſometimes retard, ſometimes incite the courſe of the blood according to the needs of the lower <hi>Viſcera.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>From the greateſt Infolding of the <hi>Meſentery</hi> ſome noted Fibres and ſhoots are ſent out into the <hi>Glandula's</hi> of the Womb or the Womens Teſticles, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>τ. τ.</hi> Into which alſo other ſhoots from the Trunk of the intercoſtal Nerve, <hi>ibid.</hi> υ. υ. and others going out of the nerve which comes between this infolding and the loweſt of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen, do come together, <hi>ibid.</hi> ψ. ψ. So that a proviſion of Spirits is carried into thoſe parts from a threefold Store-houſe; which indeed is much larger than is done in the other Sex, when we find ſcarce any nerve to belong to mens Teſticles. Indeed the Womb, beſides that it is a very ſenſible part, ought alſo to be moved diverſly, and in bringing forth a child very ſtrongly: wherefore there are granted to this both more ſtrong implanted Fibres, and alſo Nerves of a various kind and original.</p>
                           <p>Moſt of the Infoldings of the Abdomen, but eſpecially the loweſt, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:152521:193"/>
to it the greateſt of the Meſentery, are oftentimes affected in the Paſſions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Hyſterical, as ſhall be preſently declared. Therefore if at any time ſuch diſtempers proceed from the Womb, the cauſe is manifeſt wherefore the aforeſaid infoldings are drawn into conſent. But we have elſewhere ſhewn, That thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are merely convulſive, and not ſeldom excited without any fault in the Womb. Further, that Symptom very frequent in thoſe kind of Fits, to wit, in which as it were a Globe is perceived to be carried from the bottom of the Belly, and about the Navel to leap out impetuouſly, which therefore is thought to be an aſcent of the Womb; I ſay, that it is nothing elſe than moſt cruel Convulſions of theſe infold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Indeed oftentimes in Women, and ſometimes alſo in Men, I have known when the convulſive Affection hath invaded, that a bulk in the <hi>Hypogaſtrium</hi> hath been ſeen to ariſe, then about the midſt of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> ſo great a ſwelling to follow, that it could not be hindred or preſt down, though ſtrongly attempted by the hands of a ſtrong man. Without doubt, the cauſe of this admirable diſtemper is, that within the nerves of the intercoſtal pair the inflowing animal Spirits, as often as they begin diſorders or convulſive motions, firſt (as it is wont to be) begin to grow hot or to be exploded about the extremities of the nerve, to wit, in the loweſt infolding of the <hi>Abdomen;</hi> which affection of theirs, when creeping upwards it is carried to the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery, ſo that the Spirits inhabiting it are taken with the like inordination, it is no wonder, if that ſwelling up of the middle of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen,</hi> and as it were an exploſion of a certain nitroſulphureous matter, ſhould be ſtirred up. For truly it is not probable, that that Symptom ſhould be excited from the Womb aſcending and being removed from its place, becauſe, beſides this part being fixed in its place and firmly eſtabliſhed with Ligaments, the bulk of it alſo in Virgins is ſo ſmall, ſcarce exceeding the bigneſs of a Walnut, that although it ſhould be carried up into the Belly, it could not produce ſuch a ſwelling. Nor is it more likely, that this ſort of diſtemper is ſtirred up from the Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> taken with a Convulſion: for they, however convulſive, draw together themſelves and ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parts upwards or downwards, or of one ſide, but they are not able by any means to bear themſelves aloft, and to lift up on high, with a force, the region of the Navel. But, as we ſuppoſe, the animal Spirits in the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery growing fierce, and becoming apt to be exploded, (as ſuch indeed they are whenever they enter into convulſive motions) they being there gathered round thickly into a Globe, do mainly blow up and lift on high with their efferveſcency and notable rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction that infolding with its whole neighbourhood, and at once drive upward the <hi>Viſcera</hi> lying upon it with a certain vibration or ſhaking. A more full explication of this Symptom belongs to the Pathology of the Brain and Nerves.</p>
                           <p>In the mean time we ſhall take notice, that another certain Diſtemper, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Colical</hi> grief doth belong to the infoldings of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and eſpecially to this great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Meſentery. For it may be thought, that the moſt cruel torments that are wont to be excited in this diſeaſe do come, not from an excrementitious matter ſhut up in the cavities of the Inteſtines, nor always from a ſharp humor impacted in their Coats, but oftner from the nervous Juyce imbued with a certain acrimony, and ſtagnating within this infolding; from whence, by reaſon of a conſent of this with the infoldings both Hepatick and Splenetick, a frequent and cruel Vomiting comes upon theſe pains. But theſe <hi>Pathologick</hi> Speculations being referred to their places, we will follow what we firſt of all inſtituted, the further paſſage of the intercoſtal Nerve, by which we are led to the two leſſer and loweſt Infoldings of the <hi>Abdomen.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Below the Meſenterick Nerves, out of which the ſuperior Infoldings are made, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſcending intercoſtal Trunk ſends forth three or four ſingular ſhoots, which are carried into the Ureters, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>υ. υ.</hi> The uſe of theſe ſeems to be, to pull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and to jog or ſhake thoſe urinary Chanels, that the Serum ſeparated in the Reins, may be the more readily drawn out towards the Bladder. Moreover, if at any time a viſcous or muddy matter doth ſtick to the paſſages of the Ureters, or a more fixed ſtone doth obſtruct their Cavities, they, by the help of the Nerves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted here and there in their whole tract, being pulled together and wrinkled, may preſs down and always move forward any bulk or ſubſtance ſtaying in the paſſage.</p>
                           <p>Nigh the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> out of which the Crural Nerves begin to go forward, three diſtinct branches brought to either intercoſtal Nerve, are carried from thence into the loweſt hollowneſs of the Belly, where they make the infolding which is the loweſt of the <hi>Abdomen, Fig.</hi> 11. <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>. <hi>π. π. π.</hi> That here ſo many nerves, to wit, ſix large ones
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:152521:193"/>
joyning together do make but a ſmall infolding, <hi>viz.</hi> a leſſer than is raiſed higher in a ſingle branch of the nerve; the reaſon is, becauſe this infolding is like an Inn, where the inflowing Spirits dwell no long time, but it receiving them only in their paſſage, preſently commits them to other infoldings placed here and there above, below, and of one ſide, and made for divers offices; for from hence the chief paſſage, and as it were a broad way, leads to the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery; moreover, from hence nerves, diverſly going out, make three other infoldings, which reſpect the parts and ways by which the ſeveral Excretions, to wit, of the Dung, Urine, and Seed, are made in the lower Belly.</p>
                           <p>The firſt Nerve therefore ſent out of this loweſt Infolding into the greateſt of the Meſentery, a little before it reaches to it, imparts two noted ſhoots to the Glandula's of the Womb; but in its aſcent it admits four other branches, as it were ſubſidiary, <hi>viz.</hi> two on either ſide from the intercoſtal pair, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. χ. ſo that the nerve here ſeems to be the chief means of paſſage of the animal Spirits deſtinated to the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery and to the uterine Glandula's; which paſſage however is carried into the deſigned parts, not immediately, but a compaſs being made, it firſt goes forward beyond its bound, and at length with a certain going back. The reaſon of which is, that the motions of all the Inteſtines, <hi>viz.</hi> the Vermiculations ſhould be directed downwards towards the ſtraight Inteſtine, and alſo that the actions of the Womb ſhould tend thither; therefore 'twas fit, that the animal Spirits ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied from below whither the motion inclined. For by the like means, this Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terick nerve and the two returning nerves, being firſt carried lower, aſcend into their Provinces; to wit, that they may pull together the reſpective parts toward that bound placed below, as it were to a Pully.</p>
                           <p>Further, for this end, to wit, that the influence of the Spirits actuating ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, might be derived lower; the other infolding of the Abdomen, to wit, the leaſt, is added immediately to this. Becauſe upon the Nerves being carried from hence about an inch, there grows a ſmall infolding; out of which, one nerve being ſent out into the greateſt infolding of the <hi>Meſentery,</hi> ſtretches it ſelf under the top of the ſtraight Inteſtine and part of the <hi>Colon, Fig.</hi> 11. ☿. α. And another nerve, deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this infolding, is carried under the loweſt part of the ſame ſtraight Inteſtine, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>b.</hi> which alſo, two ſhoots carried from the infoldings placed in the <hi>Pelvis</hi> or Baſon, meet, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>d. d.</hi> It will not be hard to declare the uſes of this infolding and its nerves: becauſe all thoſe nervous paſſages are emptied about the offices and motions of the ſtraight Inteſtine. The aſcending nerve directs the Vermiculations of the ſame ſtraight Inteſtine, as alſo of the lower part of the Colon, and then (the greateſt infolding of the Meſentery mediating) of ſome other Inteſtines to be made downwards; but the deſcending nerve, in oppoſition to the other, drawing the loweſt part of the ſtraight Inteſtine upwards, takes care that the Excrements being carried towards the Arſe-hole, may not ſlide out ſuddenly and unexpectedly. Then foraſmuch as two nerves from the two infoldings placed within the Baſon or Tunnel, (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foldings immediately admitting a noted Vertebral branch, are partakers of the ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous Function) meet with this deſcending nerve, and are ingraffed into it; it comes to paſs from all of them together, that the Excrements being detained at the doors, when it ſhall be convenient, the Appetite commanding, are caſt out. Nature, that it might ſhun filthineſs, is ſo careful, that for the carrying out of the Excrements it conſtitutes nervous Veſſels, with as noted a proviſion, as for the performing any where of the moſt ſplendid offices.</p>
                           <p>From the loweſt Infolding of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> two nerves being ſent into the Tunnel, receive there on both ſides a noted Vertebral Nerve; and ſo conſtitute two infoldings, to wit, one in either ſide, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>C.C. K.K.</hi> Theſe infoldings near the doors, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before the chief excretory paſſages, ſerve for the opening and ſhutting them: a Vertebral branch comes to either as a ſupply; by which it comes to paſs, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the increaſing the forces of the Spirits, their acts flowing from theſe infoldings, become in ſome meaſure ſpontaneous. By what means and for what end, the nerve aſcending from either infolding, is beſtowed on the ſtraight Inteſtine, was ſhewn but now. Moreover, two deſcending on both ſides, are carried into the neck or porch of the Womb, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>e. g.</hi> Without doubt, whatever of ſenſe or motion is made about the Venereal acts, is owed to the influence of the Spirits through theſe Nerves. In Men the delightful profuſion of the Genital humor, and in Women the no leſs pleaſant reception of the ſame depends on the action of thoſe nerves. Laſtly,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:152521:194"/>
from the ſame infolding another nerve deſcending and broken into certain ſhoots, is diſtributed on both ſides into the Bladder and its Sphincter, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>f.</hi> Certainly by theſe nerves the buſineſs of making water is performed, and when at any time the ſame is painful, the troubleſom ſenſe is impreſſed on them. But foraſmuch as the nerves dedicated to the ſeveral Excretions proceed on both ſides from the ſame infolding, therefore the acts of them all are in ſome meaſure alike among themſelves, ſo indeed, that if any excretory paſſage ſhould be weak or ill affected, it ſends forth its charge which it ſhould keep, whether it will or no. This is ſo well known, that there is no need to illuſtrate the matter with inſtances.</p>
                           <p>Theſe Nerves and Infoldings being ſo made, there is not much buſineſs beſides left for the intercoſtal pair. About the beginning of the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> both Trunks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining mutually one to the other, communicate among themſelves by a croſs ſhoot or two, then they end in very ſmall Fibres, which are diſtributed into the Sphincter of the <hi>Anus, Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>q. r. s.</hi> Here the intercoaſt pair is after the ſame manner, as we have obſerved concerning the wandring pair; to wit, either nerve being brought to the end of its courſe, before they enter upon their laſt task, incline themſelves to mutual embraces. Concerning the laſt offices of either pair, this Conformity may be alſo noted; that whenas the <hi>Viſcera</hi> dedicated to Chylification, to wit, the Ventricle and Inteſtines, are ſtill continued to the laſt by the ſame paſſage and the ſame perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual cavity or hollowneſs; the firſt doors of this Cavity, to wit, the Orifices of the Ventricle, are kept by the loweſt branches of the wandring pair joyned among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but before the laſt door of the ſame, to wit, the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the <hi>Anus,</hi> the extremities of the intercoſtal pair, alſo before joyned among themſelves, are placed. But to this part, as if it had never provided enough for it, beſides the nerves ſent hither from either infolding next above, and theſe extreme productions of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal pair beſtowed on it, a branch alſo and certain fibres from the Vertebral nerve are inſerted, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>i. k.</hi> By the acceſs of which it comes to paſs, that the ſhutting and opening of this door-keeping Muſcle becomes ſpontaneous. Truly many nerves, and thoſe of a diverſe kind, are diſtributed into the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the <hi>Anus,</hi> to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the nutritious Juyce and its ſtinking recrements, like a certain Chymical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are digeſted within the Inteſtines, as it were within a <hi>Matrace;</hi> therefore Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which beſt underſtands Chymiſtry, is very careful about the well-ſtopping the mouths of the Veſſels.</p>
                           <p>From the ſame Nerve, <hi>viz.</hi> the laſt Vertebral, out of which a branch diſperſes fibres into the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the <hi>Anus,</hi> two other Nerves proceed, which are carried into the Yard, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>l. m.</hi> The greater of theſe, which is very large and long, is diſtributed into the nervous Body of it; the other leſſer, into its Muſcles. This mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, becauſe it receives nerves only from the ſpinal Marrow, according to our Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, ought to ſwell up and to be moved only at the ſpontaneous pleaſure of the will: but that oftentimes, by reaſon of the ſwelling up of the Genital ſeed or humor, it is erected and blown up with Spirit, whether one will or no, that is cauſed chiefly for this reaſon, Becauſe from this Vertebral pair, from whence the nerves of the Yard ariſe, a nervous proceſs is ſtretched out into the Vertebral pair next above it: in which the infolding, placed in the Tunnel, imparting nerves to the <hi>Proſtatae,</hi> is radicated, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>I. K.</hi> into which infolding alſo a noted nerve from the intercoſtal pair is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted. When therefore a communication is had between the <hi>Proſtatae,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend much on the intercoſtal Nerves and the Yard, (by reaſon of the roots of either being joyned together by the nervous proceſs) it comes to paſs, that the action of this follows the affection of thoſe parts: but thoſe parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Proſtatae,</hi> are apt to be moved not only by the turgeſcency of the Seed, but alſo by the paſſage of the intercoſtal Nerve are wont to be irritated with too unſeaſonable an action, according to the impreſſions made by the Senſes or the Brain; into the conſent of which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the Yard is excited.</p>
                           <p>Concerning the Nerves which belong to the Teſticles, here is not much to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; for we have often ſought in vain for a great company of nervous paſſages in them: I have very diligently ſearched ſometimes in Man, alſo in a Fox, Dog, Calf, and likewiſe in a Boar and Monkey, but could never find belonging to them but one nerve carried from the Vertebral pair, which alſo for the moſt part is beſtowed on the Cremaſteral Muſcle, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>M.</hi> ſo that, although an excellent humor is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared within thoſe parts, yet it doth not eaſily appear, that its matter is derived thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through the nerves; for we think the Genital humor is no more diſpenſed by
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:152521:194"/>
the nerves than the nutritious. For truly it ſeems, that the Arteries inſtil a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous liquor into the Teſticles after the ſame manner as in the Brain; wherefore in their neighbourhood theſe ſanguiferous Veſſels being very much divaricated or ſpread abroad, are turned about into little ſerpentine chanels, whereby they ſubtilize the humor deſtinated to the Teſticles, and inſinuate it, having put off all thickneſs and Feculency, and being truly ſublimated, into their ſubſtance; becauſe there, as within the Cortex of the Brain, the ſpirituous liquor being imbued with a volatile Salt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the part, paſſes into the moſt noble <hi>Clyſſus, viz.</hi> the Genital humor. But here is not a place to diſcourſe more largely of the nature and origine of the Seed: yet becauſe it is commonly objected, That the Seed is made of the nervous Juyce and plenty of Spirits fetched from the Brain, and therefore a large expence of it doth induce quickly on the Brain and Nerves a great debility and enervation; I ſay, this comes to paſs, becauſe after great profuſions of the Seed, for the reſtauration of the ſame humor, (of which Nature is more ſolicitous than for the benefit of the individual) preſently greater Tributes of the ſpirituous Liquor are required from the blood to be laid up into the Teſticles: wherefore the Brain is made languid, being defrauded of its due ſtock and afflux of the ſame ſpirituous liquor; and the Spirits influencing it and the nervous <hi>Syſtem,</hi> becauſe they are deficient in the Fountain it ſelf, are very much depauperated and become flagging. Beſides we may add, That the animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits alſo which actuate the <hi>Proſtatae</hi> coming from the ſpinal Marrow, are conſumed about the Venereal acts very much; ſo that the Loyns are alſo enervated for this reaſon.</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>AFter we have unfolded the Nerves of the wandring and intercoſtal pair, which being Executers of the involuntary Function, are ſtretched out to the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia</hi> and all the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the middle and lower Belly, and alſo to ſome other parts: Next to theſe follow ſome other Nerves communicating with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid in their beginning, or in the exerciſe of the ſame office, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſpinal Nerve and the Nerve of the Diaphragma; of which we will ſpeak in order.</p>
                           <p>We have already ſhewn, that the Nerve of the wandring pair in the beginning is made up of numerous Fibres: to which is joyned another noted Nerve ariſing from afar, and being ingraffed with them, goes forth together with them out of the Skull. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this Nerve, becauſe the beginning and diſtribution of it being very irregular, have not as yet been noted by other Anatomiſts, it may ſeem worth our labour to make a little more diligent inquiry. Therefore if we would ſearch into the beginning of this nerve, that is found beginning with a ſharp point in the ſide of the ſpinal Marrow nigh the ſixth or ſeventh <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, <hi>Fig.</hi> 12. <hi>C. C.</hi> But being increaſed in its aſcent, is no where inſerted into the medullar Trunk, but in its whole tract on both ſides leans on its ſide, to which it is knit by certain admitted Fibres towards the ſuperficies. This ariſing up from the Neck after this manner, and being carried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Skull, is joyned to the Fibres of the wandring pair, and is ingraffed with them ſeeming to grow together into one Trunk, and goes out with them at the ſame hole from the Skull; which being paſſed through, the ſpinal Nerve preſently departing from the Trunk of the wandring pair, is at length reflected outward, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. ♀. ♂. This ſtranger or travelling nerve after a ſhort commerce having left his companion, is carried upon the Muſcles of the Neck, to which it imparts ſome ſhoots, and is inoculated with a certain ſhoot of the tenth pair; but from thence being carried on further, it goes alone by a long paſſage, till it comes to the Scapular Muſcle, on which it is almoſt wholly beſtowed, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>. This nerve is found conſtantly, not only in Man and four-footed Beaſts, but alſo in Fowls and Fiſhes; and in theſe it ſeems to be deſtinated inſtead of Arms, and for the moving of their wings and fins.</p>
                           <p>Concerning the uſe of this Nerve, and the reaſon of its irregular beginning, we
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:152521:195"/>
ſhall conjecture after this manner: Foraſmuch as that is deſtinated for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motions of the Muſcles belonging to the Arms and Neck, therefore it ought to ariſe out of the ſpinal Marrow: but that it is not carried by a direct and near way into its Province, but being carried about by a long compaſs before it enters upon its task, communicates in its beginning with the nerve of the wandring pair; certainly this ſeems to be done, to the end that this Spinal nerve, being carried into the parts of the wandring pair, might perform the acts of the Function only involuntary. And indeed it may be obſerved, That beſides the ſpontaneous motions wherewith the Neck and Arms are wont to be imployed with the previous intention of doing this or that thing, thoſe parts alſo, before any other member, are affected with pathetick and ſudden motions, according to the force of the Paſſions, the animal not being conſcious of it. For almoſt all living Creatures do not only turn about their necks at any noiſe to behold whatever might cauſe fear; but they being any ways affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the twinkling of an eye fly away, their feet, wings, fins, or other part an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to them, being ſet into a rapid motion. The Neck and the Arms are pliable or obſervant, not only to fear, but in like manner to the other Paſſions. For brute Animals, as well as Man, being puffed up with pride or anger, (as we have elſewhere intimated) have their Necks ſwollen, and their Creſts lifted up: But as to Man, his hands and arms are ſo obſequious to the Paſſions, and almoſt to all the conceptions of the Brain, that they are continually agitated in the doing of any other thing with various geſtures, whereof we are ignorant or not willing them: we ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think or ſpeak any thing but at the ſame time the hands are flung out here and there; and whilſt the Tongue heſitates or ſticks, or the words at it were ſtick between the Jaws, the right hand is exerciſed, as if by its geſture it were endeavouring to draw out more ſwiftly the ſence of the mind. Truly that theſe parts, to wit, the Hands and Arms, do ſo nearly conſpire with the Affections of the Brain and Heart in their motions in ſome meaſure in all living Creatures, but more eminently in Man, the cauſe ſeems to be this nerve's coming from the ſpinal Marrow to the beginning of the wandring pair, and communicating with its nerves, and receiving from them as it were the note or private mark of the involuntary Function.</p>
                           <p>So much for the ſpinal Nerve, which alſo like a ſhrub, growing from other ſhrubs, hath no peculiar origine, but having received various fibres, is radicated for the greateſt part in the ſpinal Marrow, and (as hath been ſhewn) partly in the nerve of the wandring pair. Concerning the nerve of the Diaphragma, (of which we ſhall ſpeak next) many things occur no leſs worthy remarking. As to its beginning, it may be obſerved, That it ariſes from the brachial nerves with a double or triple root; to wit, two or three ſhoots going out of the aforeſaid nerves, grow together into the ſame Trunk, which is the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma.</hi> In man its firſt ſhoot, which is alſo the greateſt, is produced out of the ſecond Vertebral nerve; and when the firſt brachial nerve ariſes from the ſame handful of Vertebral nerves going out at this place, the aforeſaid ſhoot is rooted in its origine: wherefore, when in Brutes the firſt brachial nerve ariſes from the fourth or fifth Vertebral, the nerve of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma</hi> alſo begins its riſe far lower: two other ſhoots ariſe out of the ſame ſtocks of the brachial nerves which follow next, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. Υ. φ. But the Trunk which is made out of theſe ſhoots goes forward ſingle through the paſſage of the Neck and the cavity of the <hi>Thorax</hi> without any branching forth, even to the <hi>Diaphragma, Fig.</hi> 9 χ. where being at laſt ſtretched out into three or four ſhoots, it is inſerted on either ſide to the fleſhy or muſculous part of it: ſo that, becauſe the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is a Muſcle, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms both its motions, to wit, <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole</hi> by its own Fibres, the office of either nerve is only to carry bands or forces of animal Spirits requiſite for the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued action of that part, and alſo to convey thither the Inſtincts of the Motions variouſly to be performed.</p>
                           <p>As to the firſt uſe of this Nerve, <hi>viz.</hi> for the paſſage of the animal Spirits, the buſineſs is performed in this Muſcle, as it is in the Heart. The Spirits flowing into the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> by the nerves, receive ſubſidiary Forces, to wit, a ſulphureous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula from the blood, upon whoſe exploſion being ſtill iterated by turns, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of new, the action of this perpetual moveable depends. Concerning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts of the Motions tranſmitted by the paſſage of this double nerve, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That they are, eſpecially in man, of a double kind: <hi>viz.</hi> either the action of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> merely natural for the performing of Reſpiration, is continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocated according to the uſes of the Heart and Lungs, and altered many ways in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:152521:195"/>
their tenour according to their needs, or ſecondly, a certain irregular and unuſual motion of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is wont to be excited at the beck of the Appetite, or from the inſtigations of other parts; for the which, whilſt the reſt of the Organs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration are compelled to conſpire, the act it ſelf of Reſpiration becomes after a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner interrupted or unequal.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. As to the firſt of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the unforced motion of this Muſcle, it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, That the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> with the Muſcles of the <hi>Thorax</hi> and the parts of either, conſpire in their motion with the action of the Lungs and Heart: and that between all theſe ſuch a joynt action may be ſuſtained, it is obſerved, That three or four bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are ſent out from the Vertebral nerves, in the branches of which the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is rooted, into the intercoſtal infolding, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. Τ. and whereas from this infolding the nerves are carried into the Muſcles of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> by this means a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication and conſent of action is effected between theſe and the <hi>Diaphragma.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> drawing with it ſelf the Muſcles of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> by reaſon of other nerves, conſpires with the <hi>Praecordia.</hi> Theſe in man going from the intercoſtal nerve, are already deſcribed; and in Brutes from the lower infolding of the wandring pair a nerve is ſent down into the infolding of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> to which beſides ſo many ſhoots and certain fibres reaching forth into the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> are inſtead of ſuch a commerce.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The Anomal and irregular motions of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> proceed from various cauſes and from the divers inſtigation of other parts, which alſo in man become much more ſignal than in brute Animals; becauſe in him the communication is notable by the nerves reaching out from the Cervical infolding of the intercoſtal pair into the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma;</hi> which kind of infolding and nerves are wanting in Brutes.</p>
                           <p>As to the Species themſelves of irregular motions into which the motion of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is wont to be perverted, it may be obſerved, That we are able at our pleaſure to ſtop breathing or reſpiration for ſome ſpace, and preſently to take it or draw it out. In laughing, weeping, and ſinging ſometimes the <hi>Syſtole,</hi> ſometimes the <hi>Diaſtole</hi> becomes ſtronger, and is made frequenter upward or downward with a repeated ſhaking; which ſort of actions of it are made by reaſon of thoſe near com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merces had between the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and other reſpective parts of the Breaſt and Face: yea indeed from hence it is effected, (as we have already ſhewn) that man is peculiarly a laughing Creature. Further, (which we have ſhewn elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) from the Sympathy which happens between the parts of the Mouth and Face with the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> by thoſe nerves, a good reaſon of ſneezing may be given, and that Problem of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> eaſily ſolved, to wit, why men alone, or chiefly before other Creatures, ſneeze: For the act of ſneezing ſeems to be made for this end, that man may not only clear his Noſe, but that all Torpor or heavineſs may be ſhook off for him from the neighbouring Organs of the Senſes, yea and from all the fore-part of the Brain: which thing eaſily ſucceeds, if the Membranes and nervous paſſages beſmearing the Noſtrils and the Sieve-like Bone, like the holes of a Sponge, being ſtrongly wrung forth or ſqueezed together, be forced to ſhed forth their moiſtures; for theſe parts ſo emptied, preſently like a preſſed Sponge, receive other humors, to wit, thoſe coming from the neighbouring parts. In the mean time, that the watry heap ſo laid up about the caverns of the Noſtrils, may be emptied, it ought to be carried away, or wiped out from thence by a vehement blowing of the Air or breath. Wherefore it is obſerved, That whilſt the inward parts of the Noſtrils being very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, begin to be wrinkled together from ſome ſharp thing pulling or pricking them, and by that means to draw out the watry humor preſently by reaſon of the paſſage from thence by the branches of the fifth pair into the intercoſtal Trunk, and from thence by the paſſage of the nerves which are extended from its Cervical infolding into the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> the conſent of the ſame Action or Convulſion is produced even into the croſs bound or Midriff; ſo that by the ſame Act as it were with which the Noſtrils are wrinkled, the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> alſo with the <hi>Diaſtole</hi> being ſtronger and longer draw out, is depreſſed, that the Breaſt being dilated as much as may be, the Air may be the more copiouſly inſpired. Then as ſoon as the Spaſm or Convulſion of the Membranes, drawn together within the Noſtrils and fore-part of the Head, begins to remit, preſently the Midriff leaping back with a force, cauſes the inſpired Air to be violently exploded or driven out, which ſtrongly wipes away and carries forth with it the humor preſſed out within the caverns of the Noſtrils.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="176" facs="tcp:152521:196"/>We yet ought to inquire concerning the Nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> what is the reaſon, that it always proceeds from the Brachial nerves, and why it doth not rather ariſe immediately from the ſpinal Marrow. Truly from hence it ſeems to follow, that the motion of the Arms in ſome ſort reſpects the action of the <hi>Diaphragma;</hi> or on the contrary, that this depends on that. Indeed between theſe two a certain reſpect or habitude happens; which eaſily appears by this Argument: The Arms or fore Legs in all Creatures are made for labour and hard exerciſe; becauſe by the force of theſe men fight, and perform the moſt hard and laborious things, and Brutes run and aſcend the moſt ſteep places with great pains. But it is very well known, that by too much labour and over-vehement motion of body, the act of Reſpiration is very much increaſed, ſo that the breath almoſt fails, and is oftentimes in danger to be loſt. The reaſon of this is, becauſe by great exerciſe the blood is too much forced into the boſom of the Heart, which, leſt it ſhould ſuffocate it, that it might be emptied into the Lungs, very frequent and difficult Reſpiration is inſtituted. Therefore from hence may be inferred, That the exerciſes of the Body ought to be regulated according to the ſtate of the <hi>Praecordia;</hi> or that the motion of the Arms ſhould obſerve the action of the <hi>Diaphragma, viz.</hi> leſt they being ſtirred by a violent motion, cauſe the blood to be driven more into the boſoms of the Heart, than the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> inſtituting a moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Reſpiration, can draw from thence into the Lungs. That this Rule may be perpetually obſerved of all living Creatures it is ſo provided, that the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> chiefly conducing to Reſpiration, ſhould be tyed, as it were a bridle, to the Brachial nerves, which are the principal in the motion of the Body, and ſo might timely warn theſe, if unmindful of their duty, and as ſoon as breath fails, ſhould command them to deſiſt from further moving the Body. Wherefore we obſerve, when at any time labouring Cattle are urged beyond their ſtrength in labour or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, oftentimes either ſome deadly hurt of the heart follows, or elſe ſome uncurable diſeaſe of the <hi>Diaphragma;</hi> for by ſuch immoderate labour, either the Beaſt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing quickly dyes, when it is commonly ſaid, that his heart is broke; or elſe the tone of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> being wholly broken, Reſpiration ever after becomes painful and difficult: which is wont to happen ordinarily to Horſes, who are driven into too rapid a courſe with a full Belly.</p>

XXIX. <hi>Of the Reaſon of the difference that happens between the Nerves of the wandring and Intercostal Pair in Man and brute Beaſts; alſo of the other Pairs of the Nerves ariſing both within the Skull, and from the Spinal Marrow: alſo ſomething of the Blood-carrying Veſſels which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Spinal Marrow.</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>THus far we have deſcribed all the Nerves ſtretching out to the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> alſo to moſt of the other parts, which are the Organs of the invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Function, according to the manner by which they are wrought in man; and we have ſhewn their Offices and Uſes, and the Reaſons of the moſt noted appearances in all. Before we proceed to the other Conjugations of the Nerves, it behoves us to ſhew with what difference the aforeſaid Nerves are found in brute Beaſts, and for what end ſuch a difference is ordained.</p>
                           <p>It was already intimated, That the Trunk of the wandring pair in four-footed Beaſts doth ſend forth to the Heart and its Appendix more nervous Veſſels than in Man. The reaſon of which is obvious; becauſe the Cardiack nerves in Brutes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed almoſt only from this pair, and ſcarce at all from the intercoſtal; wherefore when they are only of one origination, therefore more are required, all which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notwithſtanding are much fewer than the ſame are in Man from a double ſtock, <hi>viz.</hi> being carried from both the Nerves: foraſmuch as Beaſts want prudence, and are not much obnoxious to various and divers Paſſions, therefore there was no need that the Spirits ſhould be derived from the Head into the <hi>Praecordia</hi> by a double paſſage,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:152521:196"/>
                              <hi>viz.</hi> that one ſhould be required for the exerciſe of the vital Function, and the other for the reciprocating impreſſions of the Affections; but that it may ſuffice, that all thoſe deſtinated to every one of their offices, may be carried ſtill in the ſame path.</p>
                           <p>In moſt Brutes the intercoſtal Nerve goes alone from the Ganglioform infolding of it almoſt without any branching to its infolding of the <hi>Thorax:</hi> in which paſſage how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is not always after the ſame manner in all; for in ſome it is carried ſingle and apart from the Trunk of the wandring pair, nor doth it communicate with it in its whole journey, unleſs a little higher by a ſhoot ſent down from the Ganglioform in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding: but in many the intercoſtal Nerve paſſes preſently from its Ganglioform infolding into the neighbouring infolding of the wandring pair, <hi>Fig.</hi> 10. <hi>C.</hi> where, when both the nerves ſeem to cloſe together, from thence both being involved under the ſame common incloſure, as it were one Trunk, they are carried together till it comes over againſt the firſt Rib, and there an infolding being made, the intercoſtal nerve, departing from the wandring pair, is carried into the infolding of the <hi>Thorax;</hi> and the other nerve alſo is ſtretched between this and that infolding: which nerves, when one is carried under the other above the Artery of the Chanel-bone, making as it were an handle, ſtraiten its Trunk, <hi>Fig.</hi> 10. <hi>g.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Although the intercoſtal Nerve is carried from the Throat to the top of the <hi>Thorax</hi> under the ſame ſheath with the Trunk of the wandring pair, yet it is not united to it; but they remain diſtinct ſtill both of them in the whole tract, and the Membrane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſected, they eaſily ſeparate one from the other, unleſs they be knit together by ſome fibrils ſent from one another in ſome places: but foraſmuch as by this means the intercoſtal nerve being joyned to the Trunk of the wandring pair, goes under its cover, it ſeems to be ſo made only for its ſafety and better paſſage: wherefore in ſome perhaps where the intercoſtal Trunk is greater, or the courſe of its paſſage ſhorter, where ſuch a ſafeguard is not needful, it deſcends alone. We have ſeen this Nerve covered with the ſafeguard of the wandring pair of one ſide, and in the other to have gone out by it ſelf alone.</p>
                           <p>Whether the intercoſtal Nerve departs from the lower Infolding of the wandring pair or not, however a branch is ſtretched out between this infolding and that of the <hi>Thorax</hi> in many, perhaps in all brute Beaſts, which in its paſſage binds about the Vertebral Artery, whereby the <hi>Sympraxis</hi> or joynt Action between the <hi>Praecordia</hi> and the exterior Organs of Reſpiration is ſuſtained: yea from this lower infolding of the wandring pair ſometimes we have obſerved a ſhoot and fibres to be carried to the beginning of the Brachial branch, in which the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is rooted; alſo ſometimes, though rarely, we have ſeen ſome ſhoots ſent from the infolding of the <hi>Thorax</hi> towards the Heart and its Appendix. In a Monkey above this infolding of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> as we have intimated before, were ſome ſhoots and ſmall branches reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the intercoſtal nerve towards the <hi>Praecordia.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>We may take notice concerning thoſe Nerves below the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> diſtributed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where into the Ventricle and the lower <hi>Viſcera,</hi> that there is ſcarce any difference of them in Man and Beaſts. The nerve of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is placed lower in four-footed beaſts: the reaſon of which is, becauſe the Brachial nerves, out of which that ought to proceed, ariſe lower; to wit, becauſe Brutes have longer necks, as if deſtinated to the yoke. Theſe things being thus premiſed concerning the difference of the Nerves in either Species, it remains that we paſs on to the unfolding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining pairs of them.</p>
                           <p>Therefore of thoſe ariſing within the Skull, the ninth pair is made up of many Fibres alſo in its beginning, (as was ſhewed before) out of which being gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether one Trunk being made is carried towards the Tongue, through whoſe whole ſubſtance, to wit, from the bottom to the top, having paſſed, it diſperſes in its whole paſſage ſmall ſhoots on either ſide, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. σ. So that nothing is more obvious than that this nerve performs the motions of the Tongue requiſite for the articulation of Sounds, as the nerves of the fifth pair ſpread into this member, ſerve for the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of Taſtes; for the exerciſe of either Faculty, <hi>viz.</hi> both motive and ſenſitive, the texture of the Tongue being notedly fibrous, hath the virtue of a double Organ; therefore by the two nerves, beſides the ſupplements of Spirits, are carried both the Inſtincts of the Motion and the ſenſible Impreſſions.</p>
                           <p>That the aforeſaid Nerves of the ninth pair may more eaſily perform the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Tongue, it ſends forth downwards one ſhoot before the entrance of the Tongue, which is united with a ſhoot from the tenth pair meeting it deſtinated to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:152521:197"/>
the <hi>Sternothyroeidal</hi> Muſcle; and the other little branch of the ninth Conjugation is diſtributed into the Muſcles of the Bone <hi>Hyoides, Fig.</hi> 9. Τ. ☉. In truth theſe ſhoots being ſent down as ſo many little ropes, conduce to the moving of the Muſcles, which are fixed to the bottom of the Tongue, which Muſcles being placed as ſo many Props to the Tongue, do facilitate its motion.</p>
                           <p>The Nerve of the tenth pair, although it may ſeem to ariſe within the Skull with many little Fibres alſo, yet being ſent down from thence into the bony Cloiſters of the <hi>Spine,</hi> not ariſing but within the firſt and ſecond <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> it is carried without. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after its entrance it ſends forth two nerves into the infolding of the interco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal nerve; for what end hath been already ſhewn: But its chief Trunk ſpreading downwards, and receiving a ſhoot produced from the ninth pair, is beſtowed on the <hi>Sternothyroeidal</hi> Muſcle. Moreover, this nerve reflects branches outwards, which are diſtributed into the Muſcles of the Neck reaching out towards the hinder part of the Head; ſo this pair, as if it were only of the number or rank of the Vertebral nerves, imparts ſome branches to the intercoſtal nerve, and all the other ſhoots and branches of it ſerve for the performing of the motions of the Muſcles of the Neck, <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. <hi>H.</hi> ⚹. □. ▵.</p>
                           <p>So much for the Nerves ariſing within the Skull, which (as was ſhewn) having their being from the parts of the Brain or Cerebel, are deſtinated to the offices of the ſpontaneous or the involuntary Function, and are chiefly diſtributed into the Organs of the Senſes or the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the vital and natural Faculty. There remain many other Conjugations of Nerves, the roots or beginnings of which conſiſt in the ſpinal Marrow, which is only the exterior production of the oblong Marrow. Theſe ſpinal Nerves, beſides ſome branches that they beſtow on the intercoſtal pair, are imployed almoſt wholly on the muſculous ſtock, and the office of them is to carry outwardly the forces of the Spirits and the Inſtincts of the Motions to be performed, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey inwardly the impreſſions of ſenſible things. Foraſmuch as the ſpinal Marrow ſeems to be derived from the Brain, and is as it were a broad and high road produced or leading from the ſame, without any paths or tracts inſerted to it from the Cerebel, therefore the animal Spirits flowing within its nerves, do almoſt wholly execute the Acts of the ſpontaneous Function.</p>
                           <p>To deſcribe all the ſeveral pairs of the ſpinal Nerves, and to rehearſe all their branchings, and to unfold the uſes and actions of them, would be a work of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe labour and trouble: and as this <hi>Neurologie</hi> cannot be learned nor underſtood without an exact knowledge of the Muſcles, we may juſtly here forbear entring upon its particular inſtitution: but it may ſuffice concerning theſe nerves and their medullar beginning, that we advertiſe only in general what things may occur moſt notable and chiefly worth taking notice of.</p>
                           <p>As to the Nerves therefore produced out of the ſpinal Marrow, it may be obſerved, That in both ſides of it, nigh the outward margine or brim, four or five Fibres ariſe in the ſuperior brim, and as many in the inferior: either maniple or handful paſs through with diſtinct Fibres the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> or the loweſt Coat of the ſpinal Marrow, which is as it were the common ſheath of them all; but afterwards the Fibres paſſing through the third Membrane of either margine, (for three cloath the ſpinal Marrow) they joyn together, and having cloathed themſelves with a Coat gotten from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Membrane, they become as it were one Trunk; which Trunk going out at the ſpace between the knot of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> is again divided into many nerves deſtinated to ſeveral parts. After this manner in the whole tract of the ſpinal Marrow, the Vertebral nerves have their birth; but in thoſe places where the <hi>Brachial</hi> and the <hi>Crural</hi> nerves go out, both the thickneſs and the breadth of the ſpinal Marrow are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and alſo the handfuls or bands of the Fibres are larger. All theſe are well repreſented in <hi>Fig.</hi> 12.</p>
                           <p>The Brachial Nerves are not only far greater than the Vertebrals, ſo that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as it were large and broad nervous chords; but that they may conſpire together, and ſerve for the ſtrong motions of the Arms, or the fore Legs of Beaſts, it is obſerved, That very many of them are knit together by the croſs nervous Proceſſes. Theſe Proceſſes in four-footed Beaſts (the fore Legs of whom are deſtinated for unweariable pains and difficult lobour) are produced croſs-ways after a curious manner, as may be diſcerned, <hi>Fig.</hi> 10. <hi>l. l.</hi> The uſe of theſe ſeems to ſuſtain not only the conſent of action in many nerves together, but alſo their mutual ſtrength; that ſome bands of Spirits might awaken or ſtir up others, and for the exerciſing ſtrongly the locomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:152521:197"/>
force, they might mutually ſupport and relieve one another. And not much unlike this, the buſineſs is about the Crural Nerves, where nervous cords ſignally large, being produced from the Junctures of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> whilſt they deſcend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Thigh, they which are above receive in their whole tract the nervous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes which are ſent out ſtill from thoſe below, <hi>Fig.</hi> 11. <hi>p. p. p.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>We may yet take notice farther concerning the ſpinal Marrow, that as it ſends out Nerves by bands, and as it were by troops, in an orderly ſeries and military order; ſo its ſanguiferous Veſſels are diſpoſed with no leſs ſignal artifice. For thoſe which are carried in the ſuperficies of the ſpinal Marrow, and the Arteries, Veins, and other Sanguiducts, which are nigh its compaſs, do contain ſome things more rare and highly worth the noting.</p>
                           <p>In the firſt place we may obſerve, That the blood-carrying Veſſels do cloath the whole ſubſtance or frame of the ſpinal Marrow, as well as the oblong Marrow with a thick ſeries of ſhoots; which may be made more manifeſt to any one, if firſt of all Ink were injected into the Vertebral Artery; for from ſuch an injection often repeated, it will eaſily appear, that the infoldings of the Veſſels do cover as it were in the ſhape of a Net, the upper tract of the Marrow. But by what means theſe Veſſels proceed on both ſides from the Trunk of the Vertebral Artery, and alſo the blood-carrying Veins, which are deſtinated to the whole ſpinal Marrow, and the inferior portion of its arterious paſſages, doth not ſo plainly appear; becauſe the bony Cloiſters of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> are not broken through without much labour, eſpecially in grown up living Creatures; and in that work the beginnings and branchings out of very many Veſſels are wont to be blotted out: But that we might more accurately ſearch into theſe hid things, we made the Diſſections of ſeveral <hi>Embryons,</hi> in which we were able to diſſect the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> as yet ſoft, and to take out of them the Marrow whole, and to look more narrowly into all the receſſes of the Bones: further, that all the tracts and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings out of them might be the better perceived in all the Veſſels, we did caſt in divers coloured Liquors. And we had our deſired wiſh: for preſently we found with much admiration, that thoſe kind of Veſſels, <hi>viz.</hi> Arteries, Boſoms, and Veins, which reſpect the Head, belong alſo to the ſpinal Marrow with no leſs a noted diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of proviſion.</p>
                           <p>When we did diſſect the Heads apart from the Spine, we did think, according to the Opinion of the Vulgar, that the Vertebral Arteries did belong only to the Head: and when there did appear in the cut off Trunk of the oblong Marrow three arterious branches (as they are deſcribed above in the firſt and ſecond Table) therefore in the Explication of either Figure we have affirmed the Vertebral Artery to be carried with a triple branch into the hinder part of the Head. But the Vertebral Artery pays to the ſuperior part of the Spine as great Tributes of Blood as to the Head it ſelf; and that middle arterious branch, which is marked in the firſt Figure with the Letter T, in the ſecond with S, doth not aſcend into the Head, but deſcends from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Vertebral Arteries towards the Spine, and conveys downward from the common flowing together of the blood there made by many Arteries, the <hi>Latex</hi> for the watring the top of the ſpinal Marrow. Wherefore in this place it ſeems conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that we do not only correct that errour of ours, but that we deliver an exact Deſcription of all the Veſſels which are deſtinated to the Spine, <hi>viz.</hi> which contain many wonderful things. As therefore theſe Veſſels are of a threefold kind, <hi>viz.</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, Boſoms, and Veins, we will expoſe each of them particularly; and firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Arteries we ſay,</p>
                           <p>The Arteries which carry the Blood towards the Spine, are diſpoſed after one manner above the Heart, and after another below it. As to the firſt, whereas the Trunk of the <hi>Aorta</hi> being there cleft preſently into many branches, departs from the Region of the Spine, therefore the Vertebral Artery is produced on both ſides from its axil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary branches, which aſcending ſtraight into the hinder part of the Head, ſends forth a branch into the meeting together of every <hi>Vertebra:</hi> But below the Heart, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the <hi>Aorta,</hi> in its whole deſcent, lyeth on the Spine, two Arteries are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Spine from its bottom nigh its <hi>Internodia</hi> or ſpaces between the knots of the <hi>Vertebra;</hi> ſo that if the Trunk of the <hi>Aorta</hi> be cut open long-ways, there will appear a ſeries of double holes through its whole tract, after a moſt curious manner, as in the head of a Lamprey.</p>
                           <p>The arterious Branches which are carried both above and below the Heart towards the Spine, becoming preſently forked, beſtow one ſhoot on the neighbouring Muſcles,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:152521:198"/>
and another they inſert into the Junctures of the <hi>Vertebrae;</hi> which being carried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bony Den, is cleft preſently into three branches, two of which are beſtowed on the medullar Trunk, and the other on the Membrane compaſſing about the bony Den before, <hi>Tab.</hi> 13. <hi>Fig.</hi> 3. <hi>a. b. c. d. e.</hi>

                           <p>As to the ſhoots deſtinated to the medullar Trunk, they preſently tending two ways, and meeting with either maniple or band of nervous Fibres, aſcend towards their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings; and ſo one little Artery having got to the ſuperficies of the hinder Marrow, diſtributes into it hairy Veſſels: but the other arterious ſhoot, which is the greater and chiefeſt, as ſoon as it attains the margin of the former Marrow, is carried from thence by an oblique paſſage into the middle fiſſure or cleft of it, where meeting with a ſhoot of the pair of the other ſide, it is united to the ſame, and from that joyning together the arterious Trunk, as it were a common paſſage, and made up of either Vertebral ſhoot, deſcends into that cleft by the open ſpace of one of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> and in that ſhort paſſage both diſpenſes little Arteries on either ſide, and alſo inſerts them leaning on the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> more deeply betwixt the ſides of the Marrow: and ſo whereas in the whole tract of the Marrow, the chief Trunk of every Artery is carried into the middle cleft, it ſeems at firſt ſight, as if the ſame arterious Trunk were carried under the whole ſubſtance of the Marrow from the head to the tail, <hi>Tab.</hi> 13. <hi>Fig.</hi> 1. Further, as by a concourſe of ſeveral ſhoots of either ſide, the ſpinal Artery deſcends above the cleft of the Marrow; ſo where the Trunks of the Vertebral Arteries joyn together (which happens to be done ſometimes in the hinder part of the Head above the oblong Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and often in the Neck above the ſpinal) an arterious branch ſomewhat bigger than the reſt is ſtretched out downwards. This formerly (as we mentioned but now) we miſtook for the third aſcending branch of the Vertebral Artery. But I have often taken notice, that in Brutes, where the Vertebral Arteries have met together with an acute Angle above the medullar Trunk, they are preſently, departing one from another, ſtretched out directly to either brim of the Marrow, from whence imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately being bent back, they are carried again into a mutual meeting, ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their two joynings together is made the figure <hi>Rhomboides,</hi> as it is in <hi>Tab.</hi> 13. <hi>Fig.</hi> 1. <hi>C.</hi> The reaſon of which without doubt is this; to wit, that the more rapid courſe of the blood going towards the Head might be hindred by its flood being a little ſpace divided.</p>
                           <p>The third Branch of either Vertebral Artery being carried into the anterior Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the bony Den, and being preſently made forked, tends to the right and left, and is on both ſides inoculated to the next ſhoot of the ſame ſide and by the croſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, they of either ſide are united after the ſame manner; and ſo all the Arteries of this cenſe or rank receive one another mutually, as it were links of a chain, in the whole tract of the Spine, and are continued in the ſame bending paſſage. If Ink be caſt into the Trunk of the Vertebral Artery and moſt of the hollowneſſes of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> all theſe Arteries, dyed with the ſame, will appear a pleaſant ſpectacle, like Net-work, as may be ſeen <hi>Tab.</hi> 13. <hi>Fig.</hi> 3.</p>
                           <p>The top of this arterious Infolding being carried into the Skull, inſerts two ſhoots ſent forth ſtraight into the wonderful Net, and imparts two others going out ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways on both ſides to the <hi>Dura Mater:</hi> the lower end of the ſame reaching to the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> ends in very ſmall Veſſels which ſerve for the Membrane of the Bones.</p>
                           <p>If it ſhould be asked, For what end theſe Arteries being concatenated with ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ingraffings are diſpoſed within the Back-bone: This ſeems to be ſo ordained for three uſes: <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, Theſe Veſſels (as alſo the paſſages of the Boſoms) are divari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated after this manner with repeated compaſſing about, that a conſtant heat from the blood being ſo turned about, as it were into frequent Whirlpools, might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied about the compaſs of the ſpinal Marrow, as it were by a <hi>Balneum Mariae;</hi> even ſuch a manner of office as the <hi>Choroeidal</hi> infolding performs within the infolding of the Brain. Secondly, Care is taken by this means, leſt the blood deſtinated for the ſpinal Marrow, might flow thither too plentifully, of might be defective in its due influx; for the blood being about to flow into the medullar ſtock plentifully, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from the little branches <hi>c. d.</hi> into theſe Emiſſaries <hi>e. f.</hi> and in its defect the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidiary proviſion being called out of the middle infolding through the chanel <hi>e.</hi> into the Veſſels <hi>c. d.</hi> is derived into the ſame medullar Trunk. Thirdly, The uſe of this arterious infolding ſeems to be, that the blood may be diſtributed from its paſſages into the Membranes, <hi>viz.</hi> which is carried every where from them through the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary Veſſels; the reliques of which alſo are ſupped back by the little chanels ſent
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:152521:198"/>
out of the boſoms. Further, from this Store-houſe, if neceſſity urges, a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is had for the wants of the Brain; wherefore from hence the ſmall Veſſels end in the wonderful Net.</p>
                           <p>So much for the Arteries diſtributed about the <hi>Spine</hi> or Back-bone: the Veſſels of the ſecond ſort are the Boſoms which come between the Arteries and the Veins for the uſe of the ſpinal Marrow no leſs than of the Head it ſelf, and are here ordained with a more curious implication. But the reaſon why boſoms are required to theſe more noble parts, and ſcarce to any in the whole Body beſides, is this; to wit, that about theſe bodies all manner of extravaſation, or any ſtagnation of the blood, might be hindered: but ſometimes the Veins are not ſufficiently emptied, that they may preſently receive from the Arteries the depoſited blood, and ſo may prohibit any flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of it; wherefore the boſoms, as more fit receivers, are deſtinated to that office, for that their receptacles are larger and ſoon emptied; and for that reaſon they may more conveniently derive the blood from either medullar ſubſtance, leſt it ſhould overflow it in the Head or Spine.</p>
                           <p>As to the Figure of the Vertebral Boſom, its paſſages being conform to the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious infolding, are put under it in the whole tract of the Spine: for after a like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in either boſom, which is extended within the cavity of the bony Den, from the hinder part of the Head to the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> there is one receiving Veſſel, by whoſe twofold chanels preſently the blood is brought back from either ſuperficies of the Marrow into the boſom, and another carrying back, by whoſe paſſage the ſame is exported into the Veins. Moreover, in many Animals (though not in all) the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms on either ſide ſeem to be knit together upon the knots between the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> by the croſs proceſſes, and ſo communicate between themſelves: either boſom in its top is continued into the lateral boſoms of the Head; further, from it on both ſides a paſſage lyes open into the Jugular Vein and into the Vertebral, <hi>Tab.</hi> 13. <hi>Fig.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>What the uſe of the aforeſaid Boſom is in general was but now intimated; to wit, that the blood depoſited from the Arteries in the ſpinal Marrow, might be preſently emptied from thence, and be retained within the more large Cavities of the Boſoms, till it may be transferred into the Veins being made more empty: But the reaſon of the divers ſorts of implications, and the frequent ingraffings which is found about their little chanels, ſeems to be, that the blood, if by chance it being plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully heaped up within ſome part of the boſom, ſhould there ſtagnate, or be apt to regurgitate into the Marrow, it might be drawn out by thoſe frequent Emiſſaries here or there into the middle or oppoſite ſide: after a like manner it is with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms about the Spine, as when a Country-man digs in his ground frequent croſs Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows for the draining away any ſuperfluous moiſture.</p>
                           <p>There remains another uſe of the Vertebral Boſoms, of which we made mention before, to wit, that the blood nigh the medullar Body, being brought through their variouſly intorted Meanders, (like the arterious infoldings) might yield heat requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the ſwift paſſage of the animal Spirits, as it were a <hi>Balneum Mariae.</hi> That the bending tracts and complications of the Boſoms may be the better ſeen, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain tincture may be caſt into the Vertebral Veins; and preſently that invading the paſſages of the boſoms and marking them, will exhibit the appearance of a long Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with many little labels hanging to it.</p>
                           <p>Yea at length by thoſe little roundles we are led to the third kind of Spinal Veſſels, which are the Veins, into which all the boſoms immediately convey their burden, whereby they being continually emptied, may be ſtill able to receive freſh blood: wherefore the venous branch is ſtretched out by the ſeveral joyntings of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> into the boſom, which preſently carries away the blood laid up in it, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced towards the Heart. The Veins deſigned to this office, after the example of the Arteries, are diſpoſed after one manner above the Heart, and after another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it. As to the firſt, a branch going from the Trunk of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> below the Chanel-bone, or the firſt little Rib of the Breaſt, accompanies the Vertebral Artery, and aſcending by the holes of the Proceſſes between the ſeveral <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> inſerts a little branch to the Boſom, <hi>Tab.</hi> 13. <hi>Fig.</hi> 2. <hi>h. h. h.</hi> Then the top of this Vein being carried towards the hinder part of the Head, is continued into the Trunk of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and opened by the other paſſage into the Jugular Vein. But further, as if theſe communications were not yet ſufficient for the draining away the blood, tranſverſe branches alſo are ſtretched out between both Veins, <hi>Tab.</hi> 13. <hi>Fig.</hi> 2. <hi>i. i. i.</hi> So mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold diverting places appear, by which it is enough and more than enough provided,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:152521:199"/>
leſt the blood might flow back towards the medullar Trunk upon any occaſion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Heart, becauſe the Trunk of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> cannot, as the <hi>Aorta,</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lean upon the Spine, and carry ſhoots ſtraight to the ſame, therefore it ſends forth a Vein without a Companion, out of whoſe Trunk forked or twofold branches being ſent forth, go forwards both to the Muſcles of both ſides and to the Spine it ſelf. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Kidneys, ſeeing there is a ſpace granted for the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> to be carried nigh the Spine, the <hi>Azygos</hi> Vein ends, and from the Trunk of the greater Vein, as from that of the Artery, the Veſſels belonging to the Loyns immediately proceed.</p>
                           <p>Theſe things being lately obſerved concerning the blood-carrying Veſſels belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Spine and the hinder part of the Head, and here inſerted in the place of an Appendix, ought to be referred to the other Doctrine of this kind, delivered above in the eighth Chapter. In the mean time, that we may return to our purpoſe, to wit, what remains of <hi>Neurologie,</hi> there is not much more to be met with worthy note con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Nerves: For they, as to the greater and chief Ramifications, are almoſt conſtantly both in Man and brute Beaſts, after the manner we have deſcribed them. Sometimes it happens, although very rarely, concerning the divarications of the ſmalleſt Shoots and Fibres, that there is ſome variety: but as to the primary Veſſels, and thoſe drawn from them, the Configuration of every pair of Nerves is ſtill the ſame or alike in all. It now remains, that the Theory of the Nerves, hitherto drawn in words, and ſo only objected to the Underſtanding, may alſo be ſhewn to the Senſe, which will make it clearer. Wherefore we have taken care, that the ingraven De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineations of the wandring and intercoſtal pair of Nerves, and alſo of others which are of chief note, and of the Spinal Marrow it ſelf be plainly exhibited. The Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of theſe, although taken from a dead Example, yet after many Diſſections and a frequent comparing them together according to their ſeveral parts, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as if from the life; the Lineaments of which with <hi>Characteriſtical</hi> Notes, that they may be the better and more diſtinctly perceived, and a large draught of every Figure, equal almoſt to the Scheme of Nerves in their animated Body, we have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be cut: further, becauſe the Contents of either ſide and of the Cavity between, cannot be at once deſcribed in their proper ſituation; therefore here it is ſuppoſed, That the <hi>Spine,</hi> with the oblong Marrow, or the whole medullar Stock, cut in the midſt is rolled out, and both ſides of it, with the pairs of the Nerves ariſing in the whole Tract, is turned outward.</p>

                        <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
                        <p>THUS much for the Anatomy of the Brain and Cerebel, and of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix, both Medullar and Nervous, and of the Uſes and Offices of all the ſeveral Parts, of which we have largely treated. There yet remains, after we have viewed, not only the outward Courts and Porches of this Fabrick, as it were of a certain Kingly Palace, but alſo its intimate Receſſes and private Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that we next inquire into, what the Lady or Inhabitant of this Princely place may be, in what part ſhe doth chiefly reſide, and by what Rule and Government ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and orders her Family. Then we ought to take notice, what defects and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities happen to it, or to its parts and powers; then to what injuries of changes or Diſeaſes this Building or Houſe, to wit, the Brain and nervous Stock, may be obnoxious. For indeed I am as it were bound, by reaſon of the Work it ſelf, and the promiſe I made before, that for the Crown of the Work, a certain Theory of the Soul of Brutes ſhould be added after the naked Anatomical Obſervations and Hiſtories of Living Creatures, and of their animated Parts. Truly it is but juſt and equal, that we enter upon this Diſcourſe of the Soul, and that other task of <hi>Pathologie,</hi> to wit, that the Aſperities and hard ſence of our already inſtituted <hi>Anatomy</hi> may be ſweetned with thoſe kind of more pleaſant Speculations, as it were cloathing the Skeleton with fleſh; and that the Reader being wearied by a long and troubleſom Journey, may be a little refreſhed and recreated. For in truth, whatſoever of our Work is performed without form or beauty, may ſeem as the Foundation of a Building only placed on the ground, in which no elegancy or neatneſs doth yet ſhine, but that all things appear rude, and as yet built of rough and unpoliſhed ſtones. A Superſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture indeed may be promiſed to be put upon this Foundation, perhaps fair and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, whereby the minds of the Beholders may be pleaſed and inſtructed. But truly this kind of work may be too hard and great to be performed by our weakneſs: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it become me to proceed in my undertakings, before theſe have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone the Cenſure and chance to which they are ſubject. For I fear, leſt this Foundation, but now laid, ſhould become too weak and feeble for the ſuſtaining an higher Fabrick, at leaſt until this hath for ſome time undergone the tryal, by lying open to winds and ſtorms.</p>

                  <p>IT is ſo Ordained by the Laws, moſt Noble Prelate, that whatſoever ſhall happen to be built upon any ones ground, it ſhall be his own, by right of acceſſion. Since therefore, to that work which I lately attempted, concerning the gifts and Nature of the Senſitive Soul, as alſo the Affections of the Brain, and nervous ſtock, and the various Diſeaſes which belong to them, I had placed the Anatomy of the humane Head for a foundation; it was altogether neceſſary (this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe being Dedicated to your Grace) that whatſoever build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be raiſed on that Foundation, ſhould truly, and rightly be ſaid to be yours: And ſo indeed, we continue the fault, we had ſometimes Committed, and it becomes not only a ſtep, but what is more, an obligation to the following Crime; that at length, we ſeem rather to perform a Duty, the name of a fault being loſt, than to become Criminal.</p>
                  <p>But in the mean time, this matter in which I buſie my ſelf, may not be ſaid to be unfit for your Knowledge, or to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing to the buſineſs of the Church, over which you moſt happily preſide; For both thoſe Epilepticks which are to be met with here precipitating themſelves into the water or the fire, and thoſe whoſe members variouſly Contracted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorted with Spaſms or Convulſions, and thoſe whoſe whole Bodies ſo bent, that they could not ſtand upright, by and by, as if by Inſpiration of the Devill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are agitated with Stupendious leapings, and other wonderfull geſticulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Theſe I ſay, and many other Sick men whom I here e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where deſcribe, ſeem not much to differ from thoſe whom we read of in the Evangeliſts, to be cured by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and although ſuch be to be cured however Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumatious and rebellious they are, the Phyſitian, however Skillfull he be, ought allways to Implore the help of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Power, to be aſſiſting to him, being above all the
<pb facs="tcp:152521:214"/>
Strength of Medicines. Therefore and by right the Diſeaſe by the Ancients called Holy of the word <hi>Theoria,</hi> and the reſt of our Pathology, as if it contained in it a certain Divinity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicates the Diſeaſe to be cured no leſſe with prayers and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings than with Medicines, and therefore ſhould deſire greatly to call upon the Authority of Holy men, and to be helped by the Power of your Sanctity.</p>
                  <p>Beſides it is no new thing that there ſhould be an Entrance into the Church thorow the Spittle, for that it appears, our Saviour to have uſed almoſt this method, who would for the moſt part, that the health of the Soul, ſhould take its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the reſtored health of the Body. And truly, as the Stupid <hi>Deliriums</hi> of Melanchollicks, the Caniniſh madneſs, and others ſprung from an infirm Brain, have driven ſome, both from the Communion of Saints, and from the Society of men, if theſe had been profligated by the help of our Art, it would not be diſpair'd of, but that the men ſhould not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, growing well, have left both at once their Diſeaſes and Errors, but alſo ſhould have become Wiſe.</p>
                  <p>It remains, that I Supplicate the Great God, that he will render to his Church, the peace he has happily given to the Common-wealth, that he may take away the darkneſs from the eyes of the miſerable people, that he may withdraw the fury from their mindes, and for a pledge and advantage of ſo great a benefit, that he may long keep ſafe and in health, your Grace, the mighty Pillar, and Glory of the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is Cordially deſired by</p>

                     <p>IN handling the Convulſive Diſtempers, many Phyſitians diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Spaſme</hi> or <hi>Convulſion,</hi> and <hi>Convulſive Motion;</hi> by the firſt they underſtand a conſtant Contraction, whereby the member becomes ſtiff and inflexible; by the Second, ſwift motions, and Concuſſions, which, coming between, ceaſe, and return alternatly: But neither thoſe who have obſerved theſe notes of difference, nor other Authors, have taken notice that they are continual: for that by the words <hi>Spaſme,</hi> and <hi>Convulſion,</hi> they often deſigne a certain Spaſmodick or Convulſive Affection; wherefore to diſtinguiſh it better, we will call the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſtemper with <hi>Cardan,</hi> tetanon, a continual Convulſive Cramp, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Spaſm,</hi> or, a <hi>Convulſive motion in generall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that the irregular Nature, and Cauſes of Convulſive motion, might more rightly have been made known, it ſhould firſt have been declared, after what manner the regular motive function, is effected in an animated Body: but the more full Conſideration of this, becauſe it belongs to the Phyſiologie, or Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Nature, of the Brain, and Nervous ſtock, it is deferred to another Diſcourſe: For the preſent, we will ſignifie in a word, as much as ſhall ſerve for the elucidation of the matter propoſed.<note place="margin">How the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Motion is Effected.</note> That the animal Spirits are the next In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of regular motion, and that their Action, or moving force, conſiſts only, in that they being more thickly heaped up together, in the motive part, and there ſpreading themſelves in a more large ſpace, they blow it up, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumefie it, which for that reaſon, being contracted, as to its length, draws to it ſelf the part hanging to it. In our deſcription of the Nerves already publiſhed,<note place="margin">Its beginning twofold.</note> we have ſhown this kind of motion to be twofold, to wit, Spontaneous, and meerly natural, the Inſtinct of this is derived from the Cerebel, but of that from the brain, but both through the pipes of the Nerves, as it were the channels, both to the muſcles, and alſo to the fibres, interwoven with the membrains, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther motive parts of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> or Inwards; Laſtly, in all theſe, the various actions are ſo expeditiouſly effected, which either natural neceſſity, or the rule of the will requires, by that only means, that there is an intimate Conjunction, and communication of Duty, and moſt ſwift Commerce, between the animal Spirits, which Conſtitute the <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> of the ſenſitive Soul, within the foreſaid parts, diſpoſed, or fitted by a continued <hi>Series.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Subject alſo twofold.</note> But there is this notable difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the motion of a muſcle, and that performed by other parts; for in theſe, the action is moſt often circumſcrib'd within the bounds of the motive body, ſo as its membranes only, or one part of the inward moves another, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this is moved of its neighbour: But in the muſculous ſtock, uſually the moving part is placed in one member, and to be moved of another next it (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though within ſome muſculous part, as the Heart and <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> they proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the moſt part move themſelves only) hence the Membranes and Inwards, are ſaid to have as it were an inteſtine, and vermicular Motion; ſuch as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is begun, the Spirits there more thickly gather together, and Spreading themſelves forth, they firſt intumifie this part, then going forward another, and ſo farther, till at laſt they draw the hindermoſt parts, and by this means transfer an intumifaction, and therefore a motion, from one place to another; almoſt after the ſame manner as worms, and other Creeping creatures make their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. But to this motive function of the Membranes and Inwards, if it be frequent or undiſcontinued, plenty of ſpirits are required, which notwithſtanding execute their task calmly enough, without tumult or great force: And indeed it is to be obſerved, that the Animal Spirits, flow not more ſparingly into the Membraneous Inwards, than into the Muſcles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it appears from the

more exquiſite ſenſe of thoſe parts, and by the manifold inſertion of Nerves within them, and the diverſity of divarication, through the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and <hi>fibres,</hi> although in the mean time, the muſcles are watered, with a more plentifull influx of Blood: But as to the motion, performed in the muſculous ſtock, the heaping together, and rarefaction of the Spirits, through the whole joynting of the motive part, ſuddenly, and at once unfolded, are performed with ſuch force, and ſtrength, as the attraction of the muſcle, in its motive endeavour, may exceed the force of a pully or windlace; and when this force, only depends on the expanſion or rarefaction of the Spirits, ſeated in the motive part, we can conceive it to be no otherwiſe, but that the Spirits ſo expanſed or ſtretched forth,<note place="margin">The Motion of a Muſcle is a certain explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</note> as it were fired, after the manner of gunpowder, to be exploded or thrown out. But we may ſuppoſe, that to the Spirituous Saline particles, of the ſpirits inhabiting the interwoven <hi>fibres</hi> in the muſcle, other ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous-ſulphureous particles, of a diverſe kind, do come, and grow intimately with them, from the arterous blood, flowing every where within the ſame <hi>fibres:</hi> Then as often as the particles of either kinde, as <hi>Nitre</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> combined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, by reaſon of the inſtinct of motion brought through the nerves, are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as an inkindling of fire, forthwith on the other ſide burſting forth, or being exploded, they ſuddenly blow up the Muſcle, and from thence cauſe a moſt ſtrong drawing together: for indeed it ſeems to be ordained for this end, that the Muſcles are imbrewed much more plentifully with the arterous blood, than the membraneous inwards: to wit, that the Elaſtick coupling of the ſpirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſumed, and perpetually falling off, through the very often, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times continual motion, might be by that means ſupplyed, from the freſh ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guineous juice: in the mean time, that the ſpirits themſelves, being ſupplyed in a ſmaller quantity, through the ſmall nerves, might even like old Soldiers continue longer in the ſame ſtation, and follow their manifold coupling or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. How elſe are labouring beaſts ſupplyed with a ſufficient ſtock of ſpirits, for ſo much labour, whilſt they exerciſe allmoſt all their muſcles, by a ſwift courſe for many howers, yea ſometimes a whole day: or who can believe that a little handfull of ſpirits brought through the ſmall branches of the wandring and Intercoſtal pairs of the Nerves to the heart, can be able by their own ſtrength to effect that its ſo ſtrong and indiſcontinued motion? Indeed it ſeems, that of neceſſity there muſt come to them from the blood perpetually, auxilarie aid, and thoſe afterwards to be allways exploded. For this reaſon certainly, the motive virtue, both of the Heart, and the reſt of the Muſcles, becomes more ſtrong and Elaſtick, above any mechanick Organ: to wit, for as much, as the animal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, acting every where in the muſculous ſtock, get to themſelves an exploſive <hi>Copula.</hi>

For beſides the mixtures of <hi>Nitre</hi> with <hi>Sulphur,</hi> with <hi>Tartar,</hi> and with <hi>Antimony,</hi> all which are fired with a thundring noiſe; alſo <hi>Aurum fulminans</hi> or <hi>fulminant Gold,</hi> and a Compoſition of ſalt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> with <hi>Nitre</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> without any actual fire, being only thoroughly heated, are exploded with a vehement Craſh; alſo to this may be referred, many Liquors, which being mixed together, or poured upon ſome certain bodies, cauſe or ſtir up violent motions, and plainly Exploſive: The ſpirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> and the liquor of congeled <hi>Antimony,</hi> being powred on one another, or either of them thrown upon the filings of Iron, cauſe a great <hi>Ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> with heat and black ſmoke.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152521:215"/>
great way; which without doubt, if they were reſtrained within the ſpace of any body, as the <hi>fibres</hi> of a Muſcle, they would ſuddenly intumifie it, and ſo would conſtitute an Inſtrument of Local motion. Concerning this thing, we have more fully diſcourſed already in our <hi>Neurologie,</hi> or Tract of the Nerves, and perchance we may yet publiſh the explication of this more fully and more accuratly ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time that this opinion may not be thought altogether new, and that I have expoſed it as a childe of my own brain, that had no other Patron, I will here ſhew you the aſſertion of the Famous <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> which as it openly favours this our Hypotheſis, and in ſome ſort gave an occaſion of it, ſo perhaps it will give to it ſome Authority. <q>Therefore this Rational man, weighing in his minde, how much that force or ſtrength might be, with which, not only the Arm, or Thigh, but the whole animal Machine, is moved, govern'd, lifted up, and carryed up and down: He adds, Who can eaſily comprehend that ſmall thing, whatſoever it is, within the body of an Elephant, whether we conceive it to be a ſoul, or ſpirit, or any other beginning of motion, that it ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to agitate ſuch a bulk, and to cauſe it to perform a ſwift, and regular dance? and ſo much the more, for that, when as that ſmall thing within that body, no longer flouriſhes, there is need of ſo much outward ſtrength, to remove it never ſo little from its place: but indeed, the ſame fiery nature of the ſoul, ſerves chiefly to this, which, although it be a very little flame, it is able to perform within the body, by its own mobility, the ſame thing in proportion, that a little flame of Gun-powder does in a Cannon: whilſt that it not only drives forth the Bullet, with ſo much force, but alſo drives back the whole machine, with ſo great ſtrength. But indeed he ſays as to the ſpirits, which (like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſed Gun-powder) cauſe the agitation, it is doubtfull, whether it be they, which come from the brain, or thoſe in the little tendons as it were of kin to them or ſpringing from them, that are thought to do it: But although either of them concur, yet they ſeem to be more preſently deſtinated to this office, which are thoſe of the ſame kin or off-ſpring in the Tendons.</q>
There needs no more, it is declared, that the motive function depends on the <hi>Elaſtick Copula,</hi> of the animal ſpirits, and its deciſion or abating. But from this being ſuppoſed, (which indeed we may ſuppoſe with very great probability) it eaſily follows, that the Convulſive motions proceed from the like cauſe: For whoſoever ſhall conſider the ſudden puffings up, the violent and ſtrong Contractions, in the members and affected parts, yea ſometimes the moſt impetuous concuſſions, and violent throws of the whole body, can conceive no leſs, than that very many heaps of the animal ſpirits are exploded, or thruſt out, even as lightning brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king forth from a Cloud. Further from hence it may be Argued, by a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Argument, that becauſe the Spaſmodick motions are exploſive, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the regular are alſo produced by the exploſion of Spirits: But after what manner, and by what means, and from what cauſes, the animal ſpirits being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded, or thruſt forth; produce Spaſmodick affections, ſhall be our preſent buſineſs, a little more largely, and plainly to demonſtrate, however difficult, and abſtruſe the matter ſeems to be.</p>
                     <p>We will not here ſtand to recite many opinions of others,<note place="margin">The Conjunct Cauſe of Spaſms.</note> concerning the Nature, and cauſes of a Spaſm, or Convulſion; that which was moſt common, and long famous among the Ancients, that this diſtemper was only produced from repletion or inanition, or from fullneſs or emptineſs, (however,<note place="margin">Not repletion or fulneſs or inanition or Emptineſs,</note> beſides the authority of <hi>Hipocrates,</hi> for the eſtabliſhing of this, an example is brought, of a Skin, or the ſtrings of Lutes, which are wont to be contracted, being either filled with a moiſt, or empted by too dry an aire) eaſily falls of it ſelf; becauſe it ſeems to ſuppoſe (that which is credible to none by Experience, the fragility of a <hi>Nerve</hi>) to wit, that the <hi>Nerves</hi> themſelves, after what manner ſoever <hi>abreviated,</hi> and contracted, are able with a certain force, to draw to them the Muſcles. If that it ſhall be ſaid, that repletion or inanition, ought to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, in reſpect of the ſolid parts, which are wont to be drawn together; it may be obſerved to the contrary, when as the Muſcels and Nervous ſtock, are very much watered with a watery humour, as in an <hi>Anaſarca,</hi> or are plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitue of the ſame, as in the Conſumption, or Miraſmus; yet no Convulſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are for that reaſon excited: among the moderns, very many have determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152521:216"/>
irritation of the Nervous parts, to be the cauſe of Convulſion; taking their Conjecture from thence as I ſuppoſe, for that by ocular inſpection it appears from the Vellication it ſelf, and by the only touch of the Nerves, that ſpaſms are induced: And indeed we have clearly obſerv'd, in the diſſection of a living whelp, that the knife being put upon the naked ends of the ſpinal Nerves, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently both themſelves, and the Bodies of the Muſcles, in which they were inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, were hauled: neither is it unuſual, that ſpaſms are excited almoſt in every man, by the punctures of the Nerves and Tendons. I remember by reaſon of an Ulcer, in the Arms of a certain man, that the Tendons of the Muſcles were laid open, which when touch'd by the Surgions Inſtrument, cauſed in the Patient a certain rigor, through his whole body, and forthwith a Concuſſion ariſing, made him to quake for a good ſpace. But in truth, albeit we grant the irritations of the Nervous parts, not ſeldom to ſerve the turn of the evident Cauſe, and further that ſometimes this ſolitary Cauſe, produces more light and tranſient ſpaſms; nevertheleſs, that the more grievious paroxiſms of this Diſeaſe, and their frequent repetitions by turns, may be duly unfolded, it behoves us to inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigate, or ſearch out other, and deeper Cauſes, to wit, the Conjunct and proca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tartick Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Foraſmuch, as ſpaſms never happen but in a living Body, where the Nervous parts are blown up, and grow turgid with the animal Spirit, we may readily Conjecture that thoſe animal Spirits themſelves, are, as in regular motion, ſo alſo in the Convulſive, the next Inſtrument of Action: to wit, ſo long as they are imbued, with a fit and moderate exploſive <hi>Copula,</hi> and are moved to that ſtriking forth, only by the Command of the Appetite, or inſtinct of Nature, they bring forth motions altogether regular; but if the ſame Spirits get to themſelves an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous <hi>Copula,</hi> and too much Elaſtick, or if they are ſnatched into their Actions, more impetuouſly and vehemently than they ſhould be; they even like unbridled Horſes, pricked forward with Spurs, leap forth inordinately or throw off, or explode violently their <hi>Copula,</hi> although genuine and natural: and ſo they carry away the containing parts, as it were a Chariot tied to them, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with themſelves, with a fierce and perverſe motion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">There is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cauſe and two kinds of Spaſms. Irritation.</note>When therefore as aforeſaid, the Convulſive motions are chiefly ſtired up for two Cauſes, hence, as many <hi>Species</hi> of them are ordained. For firſt, it happens that a Convulſion is induced without a procatartick Cauſe, or heterogeneous <hi>Copula,</hi> firſt acquired only from a ſolitary evident Cauſe: For ſo a vehement paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, impreſſed on the brain, a diſſolution of the parts, hapning ſomewhere in the Nervous ſtock, a ſpaſmodick paſſion is ſuddenly brought upon ſome, whoſe brain and Nerves are of a more weak Conſtitution: for that the animal ſpirits do trouble the containing parts, the improportionate Object flying from them, and by ſtriking vehemently their <hi>Copula,</hi> though very agreeing it blows them up, and ſo they pull others annexed to them: Spaſms being after this manner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, becauſe the natural <hi>Copula</hi> of the ſpirits in them, is ſtricken more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, they are after a manner exploſive, which notwithſtanding, quickly leave off, and very often paſs away with moving of the viſcera, or Members; only with a trembling, and ſome horror, into a fainting of the ſpirits. But Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Convulſions, whoſe paroxiſms are more grevious and ſtay longer, or are oftener repeated, ſeem altogether to depend on a procatartick Cauſe, or a previous diſpoſition, and to ariſe from ſome other Conjunct Cauſe, beſides Irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And therefore in this Caſe we ſuppoſe,<note place="margin">A preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural exploſive <hi>Copula.</hi>
                        </note> that the heterogeneous, and greatly exploſive particles, do increaſe with the ſpirits, acting in this or that region of the Body: then from this wicked Combination, and reſtleſs Colliſion of this kinde of matter, and the Spirits, frequent and vehement exploſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought forth, the ſpaſmodick Paroxiſms are induced.</p>
                     <p>But beſides the Elaſtick <hi>Copula,</hi> which every where happens to the Spirits, from the arterous Blood, and from whoſe orderly exploſion, the motive force is performed, according to the Beck of the Appetite, or inſtinct of Nature, in all the Nervous parts; (as we have elſewhere declared) alſo ſometimes other kinde of little bodys, of a fierce nature, or rather like <hi>Gun-powder</hi> or <hi>Nitre,</hi> come to the Spirits, and intimately adhere to them, when frequent and ſuddain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorces of this matter, from the Embraces of the Spirits, happen from the mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſtriking together of the particles, the conteining Bodys are variouſly blown
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152521:216"/>
up, and ſo are thrown into Convulſive motions. In truth, as often as the Spaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modick Affection becoms habitual, that the Convulſive Paroxiſms ariſe not rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on their own accord, and without any evident cauſe, but ſtill on every light occaſion; the procatartick Cauſe of ſuch a diſeaſe, conſiſts in the evill diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of ſuch a ſort of animal Spirits: For neither is the Serous filth, or other leſs ſharp humours, although depoſited in the very ventricles of the Brain, or about the origine of the nerves, ſufficient to ſtir up ſuch a ſickneſs: For that I have ſeen in the heads of dead people, oftentimes the middle part of the brain, and the very beginings of the Nerves, wholly covered with a limpid water, who, whilſt they were alive, had neither the Epilepſie, nor Convulſive Motions: But to the producing or theſe motions, very active Bodys are required, ſuch as are Saline, and Sulphereous, which being combined with the Spirits, and then on a ſudden breaking from them, they imitate the combinations, and violent explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, of particular mineralls. For indeed, if in regular and ordinary motion (as we have intimated) the Muſcles cannot get a motive force, and elaſtick ſtrength, unleſs a certain exploſion of the animal Spirits be ſuppoſed, certainly much more lawfully may we aſſert, that, epileptick fits, and other admirable Convulſions, which ſtill happen to be excited, complications of the ſame Spirits, with other very firce particles, and vehement eliſions, or ſtrikings of theſe, one againſt another, are required. But, as to this kind of Spoſmodic <hi>Copula,</hi> becauſe it differs from the natural and ordinary, which we have elſewhere ſhewn to be in regular motion, and to be ſupplyed from the blood; it behooves us to inquire, from whence it comes, and by what means, and in what places, it is wont to get to the Spirits.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt, it is to be obſerved, that Spaſmodick exploſions do every way happen, not only in the muſcles, to which only they are limited, which effect the regular motion, but alſo in the membranes, to wit, the ventricle, meſenterie, and other parts almoſt without blood: beſides, that the exploſions themſelves, in the Convulſive Affection, though they are excited contrary to the will of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and the manner of Nature, are far more vehement, and do longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, than in the regular motion: out of which it ſeems to be manifeſt, that the Exploſive Spaſmodick Copula, doth come from ſome other place, than the Effectrice of Regular motion: And indeed, it is probable, that, that flows not, as this, from the arterous blood, running every where among the muſculous <hi>fibres,</hi> but deſcends from the Braine, with the Liquore watring the Nerves,<note place="margin">The exploſive Spaſmodic <hi>Copula</hi> not immediatly from the Blood but from the Brain.</note> and ſo is heaped up, about their beginnings, middle, proceſſes, enfoldings, and Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as it were the mine of the Convulſive diſeaſe. Indeed nothing appears more evident, than that the Spaſmodick Diſeaſe, doth moſt often ariſe, by reaſon of the evill firſt fixed in the Brain, and from thence is tranſmitted, into various parts of the Nervous Syſtem: for it happens from hence, that a vehement Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as of fear, or Anger, or of Sadneſs of ſpirit, affecting the inhabitants of the <hi>Encephalon,</hi> the paſſion called Hyſteric, and Hypochondriac, doth ſo often ariſe: Further, that in the evill Criſes of Feavours, when the aduſt recrements of the blood, are transfer'd into the head, Convulſions do generally ſucceed. Moreover, and this is the reaſon, why the Vertigo, the inflation of the head, torpor of the minde, and other accidents of the Supreme Region, are wont to be the <hi>proamium,</hi> of Spaſmes preſently following, in the Inwards, and not ſeldom, in the whole Body. Wherefore it is not to be doubted, but that the heterogeneous, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſive particles, are inſtilled from the Blood, together with the nervous juice, into the Brain; which afterwards being thruſt forth, into the nervous ſtock, do there grow to the Spirits, and with them bring on a Convulſive diſpoſition. In truth, the Spaſmodick diſtempers, which are either univerſal, or at leaſt occupie many parts of the body at once, ariſe for the moſt part, by this only means. But in the mean time, we will not deny, but that particular Spaſms, which contain themſelves within Certain places, the Head being no ways affected, are induced ſometimes by other means. For if the nerves imbibe their humour from either end, to wit, the root, and the extream fragments, (which both the learned <hi>Gliſſon</hi> maintains to be moſt likely, and by us is ſhewed in our Neurologie, not without great probabillity) it may be from hence inferr'd, that the Spaſmodick particles are broght inwardly, not only from the beginning of the Nerves, but ſomewhat alſo by their extremities: Therefore that perhaps appears clear and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152521:217"/>
plain enough,<note place="margin">Sometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the ends of the Nerves.</note> that from the ſpleen being evilly affected, Spaſms ariſing about its region, do not ſeldom affect the <hi>Hypochondria</hi> and <hi>Praecordia.</hi> I have known ſome, from a tumour or ulcer exiſting in the Meſenterie, womb, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, were wont to have Convulſions, both in the grieved part, and alſo all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; the reaſon of which ſeems to be no other, than that the heterogeneous particles being more plentifully heaped up, in the affected place, Creeping alſo into the nervous <hi>fibres,</hi> planted nigh thereunto, ſupply them with matter for Convulſive motions like to fired gunpowder: But indeed, Spaſms ariſing from ſuch a cauſe, are not wont to diffuſe themſelves far about, nor always to aſcend to the Head.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things being thus premiſed, concerning the inward and next Cauſe of the Spaſmodic Diſtemper, which we affirm to ariſe chiefly, and moſt often, from the head it ſelf, and in ſome reſpect alſo from the extremities of the Nerves, it now remains, that we more particularly declare, the Various remoter Cauſes in either Kinde,<note place="margin">The more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Cauſes of Spaſms.</note> and the manifold proviſion of this diſeaſe. The Convulſive Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe therefore, for the moſt part, takes its original from the head: to wit; as often as the heterogeneous and exploſive particles, being diffuſed from the blood into the Brain, or its medullarie Appendix, are afterwards derived to the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſtock, and there grow together with the Spirits: But this happens to come to paſs from various cauſes: for there are very many ways and means, whereby the morbifick matter is admitted into the head, and very many alſo, whereby it is deduced into this, or that region of the nervous Syſtem; and according to the various tranſlations of this kind of morbifick matter, the divers kinds of Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive motions are conſtituted.</p>
                     <p>

                        </note>Therefore, that the Heterogeneous and Spaſmodick particles are admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Encephalon, it is to be imputed to the fault, both of the blood ſending, and of the Brain receiving it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When the Blood powrs upon the Head the morbifick matter, either all its whole maſs is depraved, as it frequently happens in malignant feavours, alſo in the Scorbutick, cacochymick, and chiefly in an originally corrupt Diſtemper; or the Blood of it ſelf innocent and incorrupt, receives elſewhere malignant little bodys, and afterwards fixes them on the brain, ſo in great impurities of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and chiefly when any parts are affected with an Inflamation, or virulent ulcer, or hurtfull ferment, for from ſuch mines the taint of the diſeaſe, the nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious particles bubble up into the blood, and afterwards, in its paſſage, are laid up in the Brain: So, by reaſon that the ſpleen, womb, and other inwards, being evilly affected, Convulſive Diſeaſes are excited, which notwithſtanding, depend more immediatly upon the Brain receiving the corruption of thoſe parts, through the commerce of the Blood.</p>

But in the ſecond place, the Blood however vitious it ſhould be, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with the morbid ſeed, it could not eaſily leave its Infection on the head, unleſs there were ſome fault in the Conſtitution of the brain, and its Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix; as long as theſe parts are well made, and are full of vigour, they defend themſelves, and what belongs to them, and the doors being ſhut, they admit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an unmixt ſpirituous Liquour, deſtinated for their uſe: but if either the paſſages, and pores of the Brain are too lax, or the door-keeping Spirits leave or are called off from their watches, an heterogeneous and morſific matter, creeps in together with the nervous juice, and unfolds its malignity, in the animal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. As to the evil diſpoſition of the Brain it ſelf,<note place="margin">The evil dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the brain is either hereditary</note> it is ſometimes heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary: So thoſe ſprung from parents obnoxious to the Epilepſie, or Convulſions, are themſelves for the moſt part prone to the ſame Diſtempers: and indeed, the Conſtitution of the brain, may ſeveral ways become vitious from the birth: for either its temperature is more moiſt, or more dry than it ſhould be, or it may be faulty by the exceſs, or defect of either Quallity. Sometimes the pores are more lax, or its conſiſtency is too ſoft, or too hard: and alſo the Conformation of the parts of the Brain,<note place="margin">Or acquired.</note> and its Appendix, may be after an undue manner; But ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, the diſpoſition of the Brain and Nerves, originally whole, and firm, is vitiated by accident, and acquires a morbid inclination: long Intemperance may enervate theſe parts: as alſo malignant feavours, and chronical Diſeaſes, very much debillitate them: beſides outward accidents, as the exceſs of heat or cold, an ulcer or a blow oftentimes perverts their Craſes, and renders them more inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

to the impreſſions of Diſeaſes. But as to the Conſtitution or irregularities of the animal Spirits, by reaſon of which, the heterogeneous and Spaſmodick par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, enter the brain without any repulſe, and more eaſily cleave to it; it is to be obſerved, that the animal Spirits are in ſome more tender, and eaſily diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, from their very birth; ſo that indeed, they are not able to ſuffer any thing very ſtrong or vehement, to be brought to the ſenſe or Imagination, but ſtrait they fly into confuſions: For this Reaſon, women more than men, and ſome of them more then others, are obnoxious to the paſſions called Hiſterick. Further, ſometimes a violent Paſſion, impreſſes on the ſpirits, though moderatly firm, this kind of diſſipation and inordination, ſo that afterwards they are able to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer nothing ſtrongly, or to reſiſt any injurie: So it often happens, that morbid impreſſions are affixed on the animal <hi>regimen,</hi> by ſudden fear, or great ſadneſs, which can hardly ever after be blotted out: for from hence women often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract firſt the Diſeaſes named the <hi>Mother,</hi> or from the <hi>Womb,</hi> and men the <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriack,</hi> and are for the moſt part ſtill ſubject to them.</p>

                           <hi>2.</hi> How the morbific mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted within the head is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</note> the Spaſmodick Matter is wont to be admitted into the Head: now let us ſee next, what is done with it afterwards; if that this matter brought to the Brain, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the Convulſive diſtempers, either not always, or not altogether, after the ſame manner.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It ſometimes happens, that the heterogeneons and exploſive Particles,<note place="margin">Sometimes it is carried back again from the brain.</note> are admitted into the Brain, which notwithſtanding are again exterminated, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great hurt, and before they enter into the nervous ſtock: for that the veins and Lympheducts, or water-carrying Veſſells, often ſup up what is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, and an enemy to the animall dominion, and convey it forth of doors, or diſpoſe of it into Emunctuaries, or Sinks. Whilſt ſuch a matter is for a little while agitated in the brain, its particles being affixed to ſome of its Spirits, and at length ſtriking againſt them, cauſe the <hi>Virtego,</hi> and the ſwimming in the head; but becauſe they enter not into the paſſages of the nerves, Spaſmodick Diſtempers do not follow.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When the morbifick matter is admitted within the Head, and not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from thence ſent back, oftentimes it produces not its evill,<note place="margin">Sometimes it is thruſt out into the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſtock.</note> till it is inſerted into the ſtock of the Nerves; for the animal Spirits within the Brain, being as yet ſtrong, and having got a more free ſpace, they evade the embraces of every heterogeneous <hi>Copula;</hi> which indeed they are not able to do, within the ſtrait channells of the nerves: Beſides, the morbifick matter it ſelf, if it cannot be ſent away out of the Brain by the excretory veſſells, it is by and by ſent forth to the Syſtem of the nerves as the more ignoble part:<note place="margin">Remaining in the brain cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the falling-ſickneſs.</note> but if in ſpite of the force of the ſuperiour faculties, ſuch a matter ſtays long within the brain, it much infects the Spirits that inhabit it, and induces the <hi>Epilepſie,</hi> as ſhall be more particularly ſhewed hereafter: but more often, the hurtfull matter is thrown on the nervous ſtock, from the brain, without much harm to it, but this happens to come to paſs, not always after the ſame way.</p>
                     <p>For truly, the heterogeneous Particles, being mixed with the nervous Liquor,<note place="margin">The ſpaſmodic matter being fallen on the nervous ſtock.</note> and fallen towards the beginings of the Nerves, do not indifferently enter all of them together, or theſe, or thoſe, as chance ſhall guide them, but they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the paſſages of ſome before others, and that not without ſome Reaſon. For we obſerve, that the Convulſive Symptoms, do chooſe for the moſt part one place in children, another in riper years, and a different one in more tender, than in the more rebuſt.</p>
                     <p>In children, who are not yet accuſtomed to the Affections of the Heart,<note place="margin">Afflict the foreparts of the Nerves in Children.</note> and exerciſe of the outward members (whereby the morbifick cauſe may be further carried from the brain) the Spaſmodick matter runs more often into thoſe neareſt Nerves, <hi>viz.</hi> the third, fifth, and ſixth pares; wherefore, their faces and mouths, and thoſe parts, are chiefly handled: and it is rare and unuſual for them, to have their <hi>viſcera,</hi> and <hi>praecordia,</hi> lifted up, or affected, with an inordinate motion, as in thoſe of riper years: on the contrary, in men of more advanced years,<note place="margin">Otherwiſe in thoſe of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per years.</note> by its approach to the intercoſtals, and the Nerves of the wandring pare, it being more open to thoſe of the ſpinal marrow, which thoſe nerves reſpect are wont to be more frequently pulled: but yet with this difference, that in the more tender, and thoſe who are very delicate, and ſubject to paſſions, and who by reaſon of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152521:218"/>
the paſſions of the minde, have very often their <hi>praecordia</hi> and <hi>viſcera</hi> diſturbed, the Spaſmodick matter, more readily enters the more open paſſages of the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Nerves, and therefore, they are rendred more obnoxious to Spaſmes, ſtirred up in the <hi>Abdomen</hi> and the <hi>Thorax:</hi> for hence it is that women are moleſted with the paſſions called Hyſterical, and ſome men with the <hi>hypocondriack;</hi> as ſhall be more largely declared hereafter, when we come to treat particularly of theſe Diſtempers.</p>

But they who are firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſed, ſnatch or take with them their neighbours, alſo praediſpoſed, like a fiery train; and ſo they propagate the begun affection, with a long, continued <hi>ſeries</hi> of Spaſms, from one end to the other: For a convulſion begun in the bottom of the belly, or at the foot, or hand, creeps by degrees to the upper parts, and for the moſt part to the head it ſelf: and the ſame Diſtemper, when it begins in the brain, (as in the Epilepſie) is derived in like manner thence downwards, to the remote Viſcera, and alſo to the exteriour members and Limbs.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The spaſmodic matter cauſes Convulſions either continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or by fits.</note>The morbifick matter, flowing in the heads of the nerves, produces divers kinds of convulſions, according to their various plenty and diſpenſation; for firſt of all, it is to be obſerved, that the whole paſſages of the nervous Syſtem, or of ſome of its parts, through the abundant, and exuberant matter, are ſometimes poſſeſſed, ſo that the animal Spirits, both flowing in, and there implanted, being full of an heterogeneous <hi>Copula,</hi> and a perpetual ſupplement of it, are urged into conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Spaſms. I have known ſome, who have had all the muſcles and tendons through their whole body, afflicted with Contractions and leapings without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion: I have known others whoſe thighs, arms, and other members, were perpetually forced into various bendings, and diſtortions: and alſo others I have ſeen, who of neceſſity were compelled to leap and run up and down, and to beat the ground with their feet, and hands; and if they did it not, they fell into cruel Convulſions of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> and <hi>Praecordia:</hi> 2. If the exploſive and hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous Particles, be combined with the Spirits in a leſſer plenty, they ſtick to them without tumult or perturbation, untill after ſome time, both Particles leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again one from another, and from their ſtriking one another, raiſe up Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive paroxyſms; which ſort of Paroxyſms are periodical, and are repeated exactly at certain hours; which happens by reaſon of the morbifick matters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dayly poured upon the nervous ſtock, with an equal dimenſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore about the ſame ſpace of time, it is alſo dayly heaped up to an exploſive ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude; or they are wandring, and uncertain, in others, for that the heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous particles, are poured in with a leſſer company, and ſo ariſe not to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſive fullneſs, under a long time; when in the mean time, the more full heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them together, and their exploſion, are wont to happen ſometimes more often, and ſometimes more ſeldom, by reaſon of ſeveral occaſions, or evident cauſes: hence it comes to paſs, that the Spaſmodic Diſtemper is ſometimes alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether attributed to the evident cauſe, when indeed, if a more remote convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive cauſe had not gone before, ſuch a cauſe had ſtir'd up none.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:152521:218"/>Therefore, that we may ſay ſomething of the evident cauſes of Convuſions,<note place="margin">The Evident cauſes of Spaſms.</note> we have already obſerv'd, if they be more vehement, and happen to a weak and tender conſtitution of Brain, and nervous ſtock, they are ſometimes ſolitary, or of themſelves cauſe convulſive paſſions: but as often as the Spaſmodick Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is heavier, and being made habitual is wont to return oftener, though the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Cauſe be manifeſt, and bears the blame of the effect, nevertheleſs it is to be ſuſpected, that a procatartick, or more remote cauſe exiſts, and is the more ſtrong efficient, though it lies hid within: for unleſs the Spirits are imbued with an heterogeneous <hi>Copula,</hi> they would not be ſo eaſily, nor ſo often, driven into involuntary, and praeternatural Exploſions.</p>
                     <p>We meet with a double order or <hi>Glaſſes</hi> of Evident cauſes;<note place="margin">The Evident. Cauſe twofold <hi>viz.</hi> Filling and Irritate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> for either they are of that ſort which increaſes the procatarick or more remote, and brings it ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to an exploſive fullneſs, as are an ill manner of living, and errors in the ſix <hi>non</hi>-naturals, which by infecting the blood, and nervous juice, heap up to a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, in greater plenty, on the Spirits heterogeneous particles, and by that means do the ſooner procure Spaſmodick acceſſions. Or 2dly, the evident cauſe is ſaid to be, whatever ſtirs and irritates ſuddenly the ſpirits, that they preſently fall into exploſions, and whatever it be, that cauſes them to ſtrike off their <hi>Copula,</hi> and of this ſort there are very many accidents, that provoke the ſpirits,<note place="margin">The irritate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cauſe, ſtirs up Spaſms, direct, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected.</note> planted now within the Head, and now within the nervous Syſtem, to convulſive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by a divers inſtinct (as is wont in the regular motions) which motions are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther direct, or reflected.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Of the former kinde chiefly are violent perturbations of the minde, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the ſpirits of the brain being agitated and confuſed, they excite others ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the nervous ſtock, and often praediſpoſed, to irregular exploſions, ſo a vehement fear, anger, or ſadneſs, do not only introduce epileptical and hyſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal fits, to thoſe that are diſturbed in their health, but ſometimes cauſe to divers others, palpitation, and trembling of the heart, and alſo horrid convulſions of the members and Limbs. 2. As to the other kinde of evident cauſe, to wit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Spaſms are excited by a reflected Act, this indeed comes to paſs not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, as often as any heavy trouble, with an irritation of the <hi>fibres</hi> and ſpirits, happens any where to the nervous ſtock: for that this trouble being by and by communicated, to the chief fountains of the Spirits, to wit, the brain or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, from thence inordinate and violent motions, againſt the will of the minde, that is convulſive, being begun, they are returned back, for ſo either worms, phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, or ſharp humours, cruelly hauling the coats of the Inteſtines, cauſe ſpaſms in thoſe parts, and not ſeldom in the outward members.</p>
                     <p>So much for the ſeveral kindes of cauſes, the conjunct, procatartick, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, whereby convulſive Diſeaſes, becoming habitual, and are wont to be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with more grievous Paroxiſms, do ariſe: But as we have aſſigned another ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of this Diſeaſe, where the Paroxyſms depend on an evident ſolitary cauſe, or at moſt only from irritation, the Spirits being not yet praeoccupied with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſive <hi>Copula:</hi> it is now next to be inquired into, by what, and how many ways, this may come to paſs. Concerning this in general, it is affirmed, that the Spaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic fits produced by mere irritation are either lighter and quickly paſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or more grievious and not ſeldom deadly, as when poyſon is taken, or when they come upon an overpurging medicine. Moreover it is noted, when the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick, or irritative matter falls upon the tales themſelves, or the foldings of the nerves, that it alſo not rarely becomes exploſive,<note place="margin">The irritateing Cauſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, as to the places af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, as to the ſubjects.</note> and ſo Spaſms produced alſo from mere irritation (as we have already noted) are certain exploſions; theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus premiſed, we will diſpatch the buſineſs in hand.</p>
                     <p>The irritation of the Nervous parts, which is wont to cauſe convulſive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, happens in various places, and from various matters, which are incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and inimical to the ſpirits, and <hi>fibres.</hi> As to the things, enemies to the Nature of the ſpirits, you may obſerve, beſides poyſons,<note place="margin">The places af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, are the beginnings the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the middle proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, of the Nerves.</note> and the exceſs of cangible qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which are inflicted from without; many things which are begot within us, <hi>viz.</hi> the various recrements of the blood, and nervous juice, feveriſh taints, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural ſalt, or ſulphureous humours, yea worms, the ſtone, with many other things, to be infeſtous to the nervous ſtock, and ordinarily to ſtir up Spaſmodick irritations. As to the places affected, or the ſeat of the irritative matter, although this brings hurt in any part of the nervous Syſtem, yet for the moſt part, it is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152521:219"/>
wont to become moſt infeſtous, when it is fixed near the beginnings, or the ends of the nervous Syſtem, or about the middle proceſſes of the Nerves, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in their foldings: Beſides, ſuch a matter, which irritating the Spirits, is wont to have the place of an Evident Cauſe, doth not ſeldome become, as we hinted but now, the means of a more remote cauſe, foraſmuch as the heterogeneous particles, being ſent from it, enter into the nervous <hi>fibres,</hi> and being combined with the Spirits, renders them more apt and ready to be exploded.</p>

Therefore, it ſometimes happens, that malignant humours, and infeſtous to the nervous ſtock, being poured out from the blood, on the region of the brain, and from thence dilated to the hinder region of the Head, do fall upon the <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine</hi> of the nerves; where, if the little skin, which cloathes the oblong pith, be broken, they fall into the naked trunks of the nerves, and enter deeply into their <hi>fibres;</hi> wherefore indeed, <hi>Convulſive motions</hi> ariſe, not only in the neighbouring parts of the head, but ſometimes in very remote, and not rarely in the whole nervous Syſtem: This is generally obſerv'd, in evill <hi>Criſes</hi> of feavours, the morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick matter being tranſlated to the head; alſo in cephallic Diſtempers, being brought to the worſt and deadly ſtate.

As the interiour extremity, or original of the Syſtem, ſo not rarely the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior, or the end, from a vellication or hawling there made, begets Spaſms, or Convulſive motions, and transfers them on every ſide: that this is done ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the outward members, the prickings of the tendons, and Nerves, do teſtifie. No leſs are Spaſms wont to be excited every way about, from a vellication or pulling, made in the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> when at any time Medicines, or ſharp humours, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo worms lying in the Ventricle or Inteſtines, pull the membraneous part, and ſo impreſs a troubleſome ſenſe on the chief ſenſories; preſently from thence, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the firing of the ſpirits, <hi>Convulſive motions</hi> torment now the affected parts, and now indifferently any other parts: for oftentimes Spaſms, from the more grievous hurt of ſome Inwards, do not only imploy the affected parts, and their neighbours, but alſo the Muſcles of the face and mouth, and are likewiſe transfer'd to the exterior members. The ſtone impacted in the Uriters, cauſes not only cruel Contractions in that paſſage, but in all its neighbourhood. Moreover, ſome hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteric and other hypochondriac Symtoms, are ſometimes induced by this means, foraſmuch, as by a vellication made in the membranes of ſome <hi>Viſcera,</hi> thence the Spaſm is returned back.</p>

                        <note place="margin">How the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle proecſſes and foldings.</note>3. The irritative matter, which is wont to be the Evident Cauſe of Spaſms, ſometimes occupies the middle proceſſes of the nerves; and therefore the parts, ſometimes above, ſometimes beneath its ſeat, are incited to convulſive motions: This appears plain enough in the foldings of the Nerves; for when the ſharp recrements of the nervous juice, are laid up in them, they do not rarely create Spaſms, through the whole neighbourhood: by this means, the Collick or Hiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Diſtemper, is often ſeen to be begot or excited, there being no fault in thoſe Inwards, only from the humours, depoſited in the foldings of the meſenterie, as we will ſhew hereafter, when we come to treat of thoſe particular Diſtempers. In like manner, by reaſon that the ganglioform foldings, being ſtopped up with a ſharp and irritative humour, perfocation or choaking in the Throat, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Contractions of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> are cauſed. Beſides, Spaſmodick Diſtempers do not ſeldom depend, upon a ſharp humour within the whole trunks of the nerves, and filling the paſſages of the nervous Bodys. We have ſeen ſome troubled with admirable, and perpetual Convulſions, ſo that they have been forced (as we have already mentioned) to run about, to leap, to fling about, and diſtort their members, to ſtrike the ground with their feet and hands, and to exerciſe other ſtrange geſtures, even as if they had been bewitch'd; the genuine Cauſe of which kinde of paſſion, ſeems to conſiſt in this, that the Juice watering the nervous ſtock, being moſt ſharp like ſtygian water, and being become degenerate from its due <hi>Craſis,</hi> doth irritate continually, and as it were poſſeſs with a certain madneſs, the Spirits therein flowing, and implanted.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. As to the extention of the Diſeaſe, the Convulſive Diſtemper may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into <hi>

                     <p n="1">1. The former is meant, when the animal Spirits are irritated,<note place="margin">Of the extent of the diſeaſe.</note> within their firſt fountains, to wit, the pith of the brain, and cerebell, from whence their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent exploſions happen; wherefore every internal function of the ſoul, to wit, the ſenſe and Imagination is obſcured, and its exterior locomotive faculty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: This kind of univerſal Spaſmodick Diſtemper, in which, beſides the ſpaſms of the Limbs and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> the interior powers of the Soul ſuffer an Ecclipſe, is again twofold: to wit, either primarie, which begins at the Head, and ariſes, foraſmuch as the Spirits inhabiting that place, being imbued with nitro-ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous particles, are firſt exploded, and their inkindling ſnatches or takes hold of the reſt, flowing in both the medulary and nervous <hi>Appendix,</hi> and there ſtirs up Convulſive exploſions, as may be diſcerned in the Epilepſie.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Or this univerſal paſſion, cauſing Inſenſibility is Secondary, to wit, which being begun ſomewhere in the nervous ſtock, from thence, plenty of ſpirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſucceſſively affected, becoming like the undulation or moving of waters, is at length carried to the head it ſelf: this often happens in paroxiſms called hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterical, in which, by reaſon of the Spaſm begun at firſt in the bottom of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or ſome intumeſcency or riſing up in the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> then, the ſame ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing higher, with the ſame effect, through the pipes of the Nerves, the Ventricle, and by and by the <hi>Praecordia</hi> are drawn together, and at length, the Spaſm force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ruſhing to the Head, the patients fall down, and all Knowledg is taken from them, and laſtly, the Diſeaſe being reflected into other nerves, Convulſive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the exterior members ſucceed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But as to the particular Spaſm, in whoſe fit the ſick continue well in minde, this Indeed is diſtinguiſhed into various differences. As to the ſeat of the matter, which happens about the beginnings, extremities, or middle proceſſes of the Nerves (as we have ſhswn) there ariſes a difference: For even as this morbifick matter, beſeiging the beginnings of the nerves, is fixed about the head, middle, or end of the oblong pith, it therefore happeneth, that ſometimes only the parts of the face or mouth, ſometimes the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the lower, or middle Belly, and again ſometimes chiefly the outward limbs, are hauled together.</p>
                     <p>Further, a Convulſion, as to the duration of the fit, and its magnitude,<note place="margin">Of the durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Fit.</note> uſes to be diſtinguiſhed, into a continual, and Intermitting: The former, as we have already hinted, is called <hi>Tenaſmus,</hi> or a permanent Contraction, as when one part, or more, being Contracted or diſtorted with a conſtant ſtretching, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for ſome time in the ſame praeternatural poſture; ſo, when the muſcles, or a member, ſuppoſe the eye, Lipps, Cheeks, are diſtorted from their right po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, nor cannot eaſily be preſently reduced: the cauſe of which is ſometimes a reſolution, or Palſie, in ſome other muſcles, which when they are looſened, the oppoſite do too ſtrongly Act, and draw forceably the whole part, towards themſelves, which ought to ſtand, as it were betwixt them, in an equall ballance: but ſometimes, ſuch a permanent contraction, is excited, by reaſon of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons heing ſtopped with an impacted ſerous humour, which become for that cauſe ſtiff: This Kinde of Diſtemper becoms very familiar in the Scurvy, that the ſick ſometimes are not able to extend any member or Joynt, but they are contracted round like a globe. Sometimes the Tendons in the back by reaſon of ſuch a courſe of humour, draw the bones out of their due ſcituation, and cauſe a gibbouſneſs, or bending out of the Body. The <hi>Tenaſme</hi> is wont to be diſtinguiſhed into uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152521:220"/>
of which there are three Kinds, to wit, <hi>Tenſion</hi> forward, <hi>Tenſion</hi> back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and <hi>Tenaſmus</hi> properly ſo called; and Peculiar or particular, which chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpects ſome certain member or joynt: we will ſpeak of theſe diſtinctly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The intermitting Convulſion, is either ſhort and momentary, which is act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by frequent turns, and as it were by little leaps, as is to be obſerved in the quaking and ſhakings of the Tendons in horror, which are to be diſtinguiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, with a frequent alternation of motion and reſt: or the leapings of the Spaſms, and their intervals, are drawn out longer: So it is uſual, for Convulſive paroxyſms, when they are repeated, to endure for ſome time, and to leave off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but ſuch periods are now certain, or come to certain ſet hours, now rare, and incertain, and happen after a divers manner, and as various occaſions are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. There are other differences of this diſtemper, which will be better illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hereafter, when we ſhall ſpeak particularly of each kinde of Convulſions.</p>

                     <p>THus far we have treated, of the Nature, Cauſes, and differences of Spaſms, or Convulſions in general according to a clean, new, and unuſual <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> but (as I think) agreable enough with Reaſon: our next buſineſs is, to explain particularly the chief kindes of that Diſtemper; amongſt which the <hi>Epilepſie</hi> eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerves the preheminence, and the Conſideration of it ought to proceed, by a certain right of method and order; for that this Diſeaſe, having as it were got a large Empire, in the humane body, exerciſes its Tyrranie, not only in the whole <hi>Encephalon,</hi> but for the moſt part, in all the parts of the nervous Siſtem at once: wherefore by the Ancients, it was called <hi>Morbus Herculeus,</hi> or the <hi>Herculean Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe,</hi> from the Cruelty of the diſtemper, and from the manner of the violent fits, as if ſent, as it were by ſome Divinity, being ſo amazing, <hi>morbus Sacer,</hi> or, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Diſeaſe, to which may be added, the Conjecture of a certain Divine of our own Country, of no ſmall note, to wit, that many, who were taken to be <hi>Daemonaicks,</hi> or poſſeſſed with the devill in the New Teſtament, were only Epilepticks, and that they called the cure of this Diſeaſe by our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, an ejection or exorciſm of the evill Spirit: In truth, in this Diſtemper, no marks at all, of the morbifick matter appears, or are ſo very obſcure, that we may have deſervedly ſuſpected it, to be an inſpiration of an evill Spirit, at leaſt it is probably, that as often as the Devill is permitted to afflict miſerable Mortals, with his deluſions, he is not able to draw more Cruel Arrows, from any other quiver, or to ſhew miracles by any better witch, than by the aſſaulrs of this monſtrous Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>As the Symptoms of the Epilepſie are very Stupendious, ſo their Cauſes, and the formal Reaſon of the Diſeaſe it ſelf, are moſt difficult to be unfolded. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the buſineſſe is variouſly controverted among authors, both concerning the part Affected, and alſo the manner of its being affected: many place its ſeat in the Brain, or its Ventricles, others in the meninges, or thin skins enwrapping the Brain, and ſome again in the middle, or loweſt belly, but by what right ſhall be inquired into anon: In the mean time, laying aſide the opinions of others, that the true ſpeculation of this Diſeaſe may be found out, by the clew af right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, we will firſt of all endeavour to give you its deſcription, together with the whole ſenſe of its <hi>Phaenomenas.</hi> Secondly, theſe things being rightly weighed, to finde out the ſubject of the diieaſe, and its chiefly affected parts. Thirdly and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to add the means and manner. whereby this diſeaſe is begotten, with the true Cauſes of its Symtoms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſie, or the hiſtory of the Diſeaſe.</note>In the firſt place, As to the Idea of the Diſeaſe, the Epileptick Fit or aſſault, ſeems to be only an univerſal, and more cruel Convulſion, to wit, in which the Spirits inhabiting the Brain, being firſt irregularly moved, and as it were confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, all the reſt, dwelling in both the medulary, and nervous appendix of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephalon,</hi>

begin at once Convulſive motions, or inordinate contractions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them for ſome ſpace, with frequent leapings or palpitations: The acceſſion of the diſeaſe come upon them at unawares, and oppreſſes the ſick, not the leaſt thinking of it, and in the twink of an Eye, caſts them on the ground, deprived of ſenſe and underſtanding; for that they do not only fall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but are flung down with a certain force, ſo that oft times the part firſt ſtriken againſt the Earth, or other adjacent Bodies, is hurt with a bruiſe or wound; being laſt done, there comes upon them a gnaſhing of Teeth, with a foam at the mouth alſo, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſhaking of the head, and a frequent knocking it againſt the ground, the armes and thighs, yea, the hinder part of the neck, and back, either become preſently ſlit, or elſe they are diſtorted hither and thither, with various ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; ſome Cruelly beat their breaſts, others ſtrongly thruſt out their armes and thighs, and fling them, and ſometimes the whole Body, impetuouſly here and there; many have their <hi>praecordia,</hi> and <hi>hypochondria,</hi> and alſo all their lower belly ſwelled, and blown up very much: after ſome time, ſometimes ſhorter, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times longer, theſe Symptoms, the Tragedy being as it were acted, ceaſe, on a ſudden, and then the ſick come to themſelves, and recover their ſenſes: but after the fit there remains an akeing in the head, with a dulneſs, and hebitude of the ſenſes, and not ſeldom a turning, or giddineſs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Epileptick Paroxyſms</hi> are wont to return ſometimes at ſet times of the day, moneth, or year; and moſt Commonly at the greater returns of the year or Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, or at the oppoſite aſpects, or conjunctions of the Sun, or moon, they are wont more certainly to return, and to afflict more grievouſly: ſometimes their comings or acceſſions, are uncertain, and wandring according to the occaſion, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Evident Cauſes: there are alſo Fits or Poroxyſms, now more light, which quickly paſſe away, ſo that the ſick are ſcarce thrown to the ground, nor are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into diſorder or inſenſibility; now more grievous, whereby they when taken, lye ſenſeleſſe the ſpace of an hour or more, and are tormented with horrid Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, as if poſſeſſed with the Devil: Sometimes tho more rarely, ſome forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſignes of the fit, warn them of their falling into it; as an heavineſſe of the head, a brightneſs of the eyes, a tingling of the eares: ſometimes a ſpaſm or cramp pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, in ſome exterior part, as in the arm, or thigh, or elſe in the back, or <hi>Hypochondria,</hi> which aſcending from thence, like a Cold air, and creeping to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the head, ſeems to bring on their falling down. Boys, and young Men are found to be more obnoxious to this diſeaſe, than old men, or men of mature age: who ever are once ſtruct down by its fit, unleſs they be cured by the help of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, they will hardly be altogether free, from the infection of it, all their Life after; the more often the Fits are, the more grievous they become, which as they frequently return become more cruel, and enervate the uſe of the memory, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and Reaſon, and then the ſtrength, and force of the whole animal fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, until its Occonomy being greatly perverted, the vital function at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays, and by degrees is aboliſhed. The weapons, and wicked preparation of this Diſeaſe, being after this manner layd open, we will next make an inquiry, in what part it fixes its ſeat; or what is its next ſubject.</p>
                     <p>The acceſſion of the Epilepſie, and the manner of invaſion,<note place="margin">The ſubject of the ſeat of the Diſeaſe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into.</note> ſeem plainly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that its primary ſeat, or part chiefly affected, is contained ſomewhere within the Head; but that a Paroxyſm ſometimes begins in the remote parts, and from thence aſcends towards the head, which indeed ſeems only to be ſo, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens by accident, when in the mean time, the morficick Cauſe ſubſiſts about the <hi>Encephalon</hi> it ſelf, (as ſhall be anon declared): but that from the firſt aſſault of the Diſeaſe, preſently a ſtrange Inſenſibility, and diſorder, with contractions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of all the Members and <hi>Viſcera</hi> ſucceeds, it is a manifeſt ſigne, that the whole joynting of the <hi>Encephalon,</hi> and the original of all the nerves, are poſſeſſed with the morbifick Cauſe: But truly, although it ſeem moſt difficult, to unfold where this cauſe, or morbifiek matter ſubſiſts chiefly; for, neither is it probable, that the ſame is diffuſed thorow all the parts of the Brain;<note place="margin">Some affirm it the Meninges or thin skins of the Brain, other the pith or middle part of the Brain.</note> yet it neither appears in what ſingular place this being fixed ſhould draw all the other parts ſo ſuddenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Conſent of its evill.</p>
                     <p>Among the various opinions of Authors, about this matter, there are two that ſeem more probable than the reſt, and challenge an aſſent with an equall likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to Truth. One of which aſſerts the very middle of the brain, and the other
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152521:221"/>
the meninges, or the thin skins encompaſſing or cloathing it, to be the primary ſeat of the Epilepſie: The Reaſon of the former is founded in this, that where the fountain of the animal Spirits, and the original of the ſenſitive ſoul it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, there ought to be placed the cauſe of this Diſeaſe, certainly when the chief faculties are firſt hurt, all the reſt eaſily participate of the ſame evil: But in truth, though I may grant in the Apoplexy, and the <hi>deliquium</hi> or fainting of the ſpirits, that it is ſo, yet it follows not in a Convulſion (of which kinde of diſtemper the <hi>Epilepſie</hi> is) that all the <hi>fibres</hi> and nerves ſhould be pulled together, becauſe the middle part of the brain is firſt pulled: for that this, as it is a moiſt and fluid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and wanting of ſenſe and motion, ſeems not capable of contraction, or the Spaſmodick Diſtemper: wherefore others thinking the brain, and every part of it, free from the blame of this Diſeaſe, caſt it altogether on the meninges: affirming, that the membranes, cloathing the brain, and chiefly their proceſſes, ſpread upon the clefts of the brain, and <hi>Ceribel,</hi> as they are hauled by the morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick matter, do conceive or beget Spaſms, or horrid Convulſions, and then that from the Meninges themſelves, ſo Contracted and brought together, the included Brain is greatly compreſſed, and bound together, ſo that its pores and paſſages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound up, the great amazing diſorder and inſenſibility is induced, and alſo the trunks of the nerves, to which either meninge or skin is faſtened, being brought into a conſent with them, enter alſo into Convulſive motions: And indeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, the formal Reaſon of the Epilepſie, may perhaps ſeem to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded; but truly when I conſider further of the matter, I think we may differ from this opinion, becauſe it does not appear by what Courſe, or for what cauſe, the falling down being at hand, theſe meninges ſhould beget ſuch horrid Spaſms. Nay, it neither appears, how from them, however Convulſive they be, the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptick Paroxiſm ſhould be induced.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">It is affirmed, that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges are not firſt of all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</note>As to the former, it ſeems an impoſſible thing, for the meninges to be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, as to their whole Concavities, that being bound more ſtrictly together, like a purſe, they ſhould on every ſide pull together their contents, and draw them into a narrower ſpace: for that the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> ſticks moſt firmly to very many places of the skull, yea, and the <hi>Pia mater</hi> is tyed to it, near the proceſſes of the hollow turnings, by a mutual knitting of the membranes, and every where beſides with a Continuity of Veſſells: Hence it eaſily appears, either that mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, as to the greateſt part of it, is immovable, ſo that they cannot fall into ſo univerſal Spaſms: but in reſpect of leſſer Spaſms, as when a certain portion of this or that meninge, or both together, is pulled, indeed we grant ſuch may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen: for I have often heard thoſe troubled with great headach, to complain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly of a great conſtriction of the parts, lying under the ſide of the skull, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the right, ſometimes on the left, and yet from thence no aſſault of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down, has followed: Further as thoſe membranes being notably hurt, do cauſe great vellications or haulings, yet upon it there is not wont to be an Epileptick ſit to follow: for I have known, from an Impoſthume in the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken, and that the ſtinking matter had knawn the more tender meninges, and ſhell of the Brain, that the ſick have fallen firſt into an amazedneſſe, and at length into a deadly Apoplexie, who notwithſtanding, in the whole courſe of the Diſeaſe, was free from any Epileptical Symtom. Alſo I remember, I have ſeen one, who had the <hi>Dura mater</hi> very much torn, by the inſtrument of an unskilfull Surgion, and another, that by a wound, had that with part of his skull taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſo that a portion of the Brain ſwelled forth, and yet to neither of them any Epilectical paſſion hapned: wherefore neither is it likely, that the blood, or humors, or (if any ſhall ſo argue) the vapours, compacted within thoſe meninges, can bring in any greater evill, than either a ſtroke, or wound, inflicted on them, or filthy matter there poured out: Beſides, thoſe who are more lightly troubled with the <hi>Epilepſie,</hi> ſo that they ſcarce fall down, and have their minds free through the whole aſſault of the diſeaſe, would perceive the membrans to be ſo contracted, and the globe of the brain to be more ſtraitly thruſt together, if there had bin any ſuch kinde of affection;<note place="margin">The ſpirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting the middle of the brain are the primary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.</note> but they on the contrary, ſeem to have the Brain as it were inflamed, and to be ſenſible, that the ſpirits leap forth, and are as it were exploſed, with a certain fierceneſs.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, I think it is very likely ſo, that the Epileptick Paroxiſm is ſtired up, from a certain ſuddain rarefication, and exploſion of the animal ſpirits, inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152521:221"/>
the Brain, which are in truth the firſt, and immediate ſubject of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe; to wit, whereby the Brain it ſelf is inflated, and rendered ſo inſenſible, and the Nerves hanging thereto, alſo put into convulſions: For hence it comes to paſs, that the acceſſion of this Diſeaſe begins ſo on a ſudden, and determines per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly without any great proviſion or remains, of the morbifick matter; becauſe the Infection is not brought ſo much to the ſolid parts, as to the Spirits them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>We have already ſhown by what means, the heterogeneous and exploſive <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula,</hi> conſiſting as it ſeems of <hi>nitro-Sulphurous</hi> particles, cleaving to the ſpirituous particles of the animal Spirits, and laſtly, being ſmitten and exploſed by them, by reaſon of plenitude or irritation, produces Convulſive Symptoms: But although this kinde of Spaſmodick <hi>Copula,</hi> is firſt diſtilled from the blood into the brain, yet, for the moſt part, it does not take hold of the ſpirits there, or at leaſt, it ſtays not long with them, in that place: but rather, being thruſt from thence, towards the nervous <hi>Appendix,</hi> cauſes particular and reſpective Spaſms, near the places affected: But ſometimes, if the Spaſmodic matter be more plentifull and ſtrong, and the conſtitution of the brain weak, the heterogeneous <hi>Copula,</hi> being fixed to the Spirits, not only in the nervous ſtock, but alſo to thoſe planted within the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephalon</hi> it ſelf, cauſes the Epilectick diſpoſition; and the exploſive particles of the Spirits, and this <hi>Copula</hi> knocking one againſt another, ſtir up the falling fit. For indeed, ſince the aſſault of the <hi>Epilepſie</hi> urging, the Inſenſibility, and great diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is for the moſt part the firſt Symptom, and all the pathognomick, it may be concluded, that the animal Spirits, lying within the middle of the brain it ſelf, are affected before others; and that therefore, that part, is the principal ſeat of the Diſeaſe: Then, forasmuch as the falling of the ſick, or caſting to the ground, and ſpaſms of rhe members and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> moſt often follow that Inſenſibility great diſorder, or leaping forth, of the ſpirits, it follows that the animal Spirits alſo inhabiting the nervous Syſtem, are imbrued with the ſame exploſive <hi>Copula,</hi> and are drawn into conſent with thoſe inhabiting the brain it ſelf, and are excited by them, to exploſions purely inordinate; although ſometimes (by the whole <hi>ſeries</hi> of Spirits, planted both in the brain and nervous ſtock, being like a long train of gunpowder, praediſpoſed to exploſions) an exterior Spaſm, beginning a great way off, perhaps in ſome member or Inward, may afterwards be carried to the Brain, as ſhall be more fully ſhown hereafter. In the mean time, it is concluded, that the region of the Brain it ſelf, is always the primary ſeat of this Diſeaſe; and that we ought to ſuppoſe, the conjunct cauſe of the Diſtemper, not to be water heaped up within the ventricles of the brain, nor a thick or clammy humour, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted in the paſſages of its pores: for ſuch Cauſes are begotten by degrees, and therefore would ſhew ſome certain ſignes before-hand, of the firſt coming upon one: further, the aſſault of the fit being over, ſuch a matter could not be wholly diſcuſſed in ſo ſhort a time, but that from its reliques, ſome impediments of the animal function would remain, which indeed rarely happens in the Epilepſie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe inveterate: but, for the exciting of the falling down, no leſſe can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then that the animal Spirits, which flowing within the marrowie ſubſtance of the brain, perform the acts of the interior ſenſe, of the Imagination, and appetite, having gotten an heterogeneous <hi>Copula,</hi> ſhould be inordinately exploded, and ſo they being diſturbed beyond their orders and ſtations, the Superior faculties of the animal regimen, muſt ſuffer an eclipſe; then, from this greater exploſion of ſpirits, as it were from a fiery enkindling, other Spirits, inhabiting the marrowy and nervous appendix, being alſo praediſpoſed to exploſions, conceive the like diſorder, and in like manner, cauſe the exploſive Convulſive motions, of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Bodys.</p>
                     <p>For although we conclude, that the middle of the brain,<note place="margin">The diſeaſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily very many parts, of the Nervous Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem.</note> is always the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeat of the Epilepſie, and that from the beginning, the morbific matter is layd up wholly in that Region; yet the diſtemper growing grievous, this being more plentifully ſpread thorow the head, enlarges its bounds, ſo that it being ſtrowed here and there, and far and neer ſtretched out, Spaſmodic particles, are caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the reſt of the Brain, and alſo into the nervous <hi>appendix,</hi> like gunpowder or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſive ſeed, whereby it comes to paſſe, that at the firſt approach of that diſorder of Spirits, Convulſions follow, ſometimes in theſe, ſometimes in thoſe parts, and not rarely thorow the whole Body.</p>

                     <p>THus far of the eſſence, and the Cauſes in generall of the Epilepſie, it ſhall be now our next task, to explicate the differences of this Diſeaſe, alſo the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſome of the accidents, and Symptoms, belonging to it: to which we will laſtly add, Obſervations and Hiſtories of ſick people, with the method of Curing.</p>
                     <p>The moſt notable difference of the Epilepſie, is wont to be taken from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to wit, that the brain, or part of it, labouring with this diſeaſe, is either primarily, and Idiopathetically, or properly, affected, or ſecondarily, and not but by conſent, with other parts: concerning the former kinde, we have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſcourſed, as to the other, to wit, in which the falling down ſeems to ariſe, from ſome place without the head, and then lays hold of it ſecondarily, and as it were by a blaſt ſent from elſewhere; It is to be obſerv'd, that this kinde of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper (as <hi>Galen</hi> hath noted) proceeds either from the external, or internal parts:<note place="margin">The Reaſon of the Epilepſie which is ſaid to be excited by conſent.</note> we meet with many examples of Epilepticks, in whom the fit being juſt coming upon them, a ſpaſm is felt, with a numneſs in the hand or toe, or other particular member, which preſently from thence, as it were with a pricking of tingling, creeps towards the head, which when it hath attained, immediately the ſick party falls flat on the Earth, and is hurried into Inſenſibility and diſorder of ſpirits, and other proper demonſtrations of the Symptom of the falling ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: neither is it a leſs uſuall <hi>proaemium</hi> of this diſeaſe, that there firſt ariſes as it were a conflict, in the ſtomach, ſpleen, womb, Inteſtines, genitalls, or other inwards; or that ſome kinde of perturbation is raiſed in ſome of them; then from that place, the aſcent of (as it were) a cold air is perceived, to which diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, follows the acceſſion of the falling evill, with its moſt horrid proviſion of ſymptoms: hence it was commonly believed, that the cauſe of the Epilepſie, lay hid in the part, ſeen to be ſo primarily affected, and propagated its evil to the brain, of its ſelf innocent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Conjunct Cauſe of the Epilepſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts only in the brain.</note>But in very deed, as to this, we muſt ſay, that in every Epilepſie, not only the procatartick or remoter Cauſe, but alſo the conjunct, remains wholly in the Brain; to wit, that the ſpirits inhabiting it, being diſpoſed to exploſions, and there being exploſed, bring on or Cauſe every falling Evill. As to thoſe praeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary Symptoms in ſome Epileptical people, they ſometimes have the place of an Evident Cauſe, and ſometimes only of a ſigne: For when the evill diſpoſition of any inward, as the ſtomach, ſpleen, or womb, happens with the diſpoſition of the Epilepſie, as often as any perturbation is begun in that diſtempered In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it eaſily happens, by reaſon of a tranſmiſſion of the ferment from thence, or a continuation of the ſpaſm to the head, an Epileptical fit is excited in the Brain prae-diſpoſed to act.</p>
                     <p>But theſe kind of ſymtoms of the falling evil, which being ſuſcitated from without, ſeem to propagate the diſtemper to the Brain, do often ariſe from the conſent of the Brain it ſelf, and are only ſigns of the approach of the Epileptical Fit, or of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits beginning to be exploded, in the brain: For when the animal ſpirits planted in the middle parts of the Brain, and Cerebel, and alſo thoſe in the oblong pith or marrow, neer the beginnings of the Nerves, are ſo filled with an heterogeneous Copula, that, for the Caſting of it off, they are ready to bring on the aſſault of the Diſeaſe, before they are all exploded heap by heap, ſome ſpirits lying more outward, in ſome private Nerves, becauſe they are deſtitute of the wonted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of their ſuperiors, fall into certain inordinations, and ſo begin ſpaſms, which ſpaſms (as it is often the manner in this kinde of diſtemper) begin at the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities or ends of the Nerves, inſerted to this or that member, or Inward, from whence by degrees, they creep forward to their beginnings; whether being come forth with the ſpirits, thorow the whole <hi>Encephalon,</hi> before diſpoſed to exploſions,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:152521:222"/>
being moved by that ſpaſms, and ſo being ſnatch'd away with a fiery enkindling, are ſuddenly exploded or thurſt out; ſo they ſeem to ſtir up the Epileptick Fit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at firſt from themſelves, as it were ſecondarily, and by inſtinct, brought from ſome other place. After this manner, ſometimes the Hiſterical paſſions, when beginning in the bottom of the belly, they are Communicated to the Brain, are thought to ariſe from thoſe Viſcera, and to be ſtirred up by their fault; when in the mean time, the morbific cauſe ſubſiſts chiefly, about the beginnings of the Nerves, as we have elſewhere ſignified, and ſhall again ſhow hereafter, when we come to treat particularly of the Spaſmodick diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>There yet remain other differences of the Falling ſickneſs, to wit, that it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haereditary, or acquired; again, either kind is variouſly diſtinguiſh'd,<note place="margin">Other differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſie.</note> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Age, or time, in which it firſt comes upon one, to wit, when the firſt coming of it happens before, or about the puberty, or being of ripe age, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it; further as to the Efficacy of the diſeaſe, into ſtrong, and weak, for as much as the Paroxyſms or fits, are with, or without the diſorder of ſpirits, and falling, as to its inordinate manner, whoſe aſſalts are wandring, and uncertain, moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it is wont to be diſtinguiſhed, according to the peculiar ſymptoms, in theſe, or thoſe ſick people, by reaſon of ſome diſpoſition, or manifold Idioſyncraſy, or propriety, of the Temperament.</p>
                     <p>But from what has been ſaid before, of very many of the Symptoms, which are to be met with in this Diſeaſe, the cauſes do eaſily appear, ſo that there will be no need here, to conſider all of them: but of ſome of them, which ſeem more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, it will not be from the matter, to diſcourſe in this place.</p>
                     <p>We will therefore firſt of all inquire, why thoſe ſick of this Diſeaſe,<note place="margin">Why Epilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks fall down with violence.</note> do not fall as thoſe that are apoplectick, or have ſwounding fits, but are rather ſtricken down with violence, againſt the Earth, or any other bodys, that are by chance oppoſite to them, as if they were ſmitten down by ſome wicked Spirit, ſo that very often, ſome part of the head, or face, is hurt, with the violent fall: And thoſe ſo diſtempered, even like the Daemonaicks in the Goſpel, are frequently flung into the fire, or the water: but it may be here declared, that the Epilepticks become obnoxious to theſe kinde of evills, for that the fit coming upon them, all knowledge or providence is taken from them; and further the nerves neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to the head, being ſtrongly contracted, the whole bulk of the Body is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away headlong: but in the Syncope, and Apoplexie, the fall of the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perd Body, ſeems as the ruines of a building, which happens, by reaſon that its props are taken away: but indeed in the falling Sickneſſe, it is no otherwiſe than if a houſe were overthrown, by the blowing up of Gunpowder, which is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved much from the place where it ſtood.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly. It is commonly eſteemed a great pathognomick,<note place="margin">From whence the Foam at the mouth of theſe troubled with the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſickneſs comes.</note> or peculiar Symtom of the Epilepſie, if when the diſeaſed being fallen to the earth, and ſuffering moſt horrid Convulſions, there flows from the mouth, a ſpumous Spittle or foam, which indeed is thought to be preſſed from the Brain, being ſtrongly contracted, into the palate: But in truth, though it be granted, that this flux of ſpume be very often a ſigne of the falling Sickneſſe, yet it is not ſo appropriated to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, but that the ſame ſometimes happens in the Apoplexie, in deep ſleep, in hyſterical diſtempers, and other convulſive diſeaſes: Beſides, this kinde of Foam, does not deſcend from the Brain, for there is no paſſage open, by which it may paſs, but from the Lungs being inflated, and elevated even to the Larinx, or the top of the ſharp arterie, from whence ſpittle foams forth, with a certain fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency and ebullition: For the fit of the falling evill growing urgent, when moſt of the nerves in the whole Body are drawn together, thoſe alſo that ſerve for the motions of the Lungs, and Diaphragma, ſuffer moſt cruel convulſions, and lifting up all the praecordia upwards, continue them almoſt immovable, in a long Syſtole, ſo that the breathing, and pulſe, cannot be at all perceived: In the mean time, becauſe the blood ſtraitned within the boſom of the heart, diſtends it, and alſo almoſt choakes it, the Lungs however hindred, that they cannot be moved after their wonted and natural manner, perform what they can, with a thick and haſty agitation, whereby the blood may be drawn forth from the Heart; by which endeavour of theirs, the ſhaking aire, by the frequent or thick reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, raiſes the viſcous or clammy humidity into froth, like the ſhaking of the white of an egg; by and by it lifts it upwards towards the Cavity of the mouth,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152521:223"/>
and ſo at laſt drives it out of doors: wherefore, a foam or ſpumous ſpittle does often ſucceed in other diſtempers, where the pneumonic or breathing nerves are either contracted, or are hindred from performing their Function.</p>

Moreover, from the ſame reaſon it comes to paſſe, that ſome Epilepticks being fallen to the ground, beat moſt greviouſly their Breaſts with their Hands, and are hardly to be held from it: for when the Praecordia, being troubled with the Spaſm, and hindred that they cannot move themſelves, after their wonted manner, and the blood ſtagnating in them, not without a great oppreſſion of the heart, threatens a ſuffocation of Life; then it is that the ſick ſtrikes their Breaſt, to wit, that the praecordia ſo ſhaken, and as it were moved up and down, might renew their motions, and ſo the blood might be relieved from its ſtagnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the heart from its heavy oppreſſion: and this is done after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as when ſome that are ſleeping being tickled, or bit by a flea, unknown to themſelves, preſently rub, or ſcratch the affected place.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Diſeaſe.</note>As to the Prognoſtication of the diſeaſe, we have already declared, that it is of very difficult Cure, which difficultly conſiſts in this, that the middle of the Brain (in which is the chief ſpring and fountain of the animal Spirits) is very much debilitated, not only by the morbifick cauſe, but alſo by its effects, to wit, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral fits; and its pores looſened, ſo that they ly open for the entrance of every heterogeneous matter: and ſo the morbid diſpoſition it ſelf being confirmed, by the repeated Paroxiſms, and taking deeper root, it is hardly taken away. But it is to be obſerv'd, that the Epilepſie ſometimes terminates of it ſelf, and is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times overcome by the help of medicines: which happens about the age of puber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and then only, ſo that, who are not cured, that time being elapſed, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the twenty fifth year of age, they ſcarce ever after recover their health, for about the time of ripe age, there is a twofold alteration of the humane Body, and therefore, there often happens a Solution or looſing of the falling ſickneſſe, or of any other diſeaſe deeply rooted: For firſt, at that time, the genital humour begins to be heaped together in the ſpermatick Veſſells, from whence it follows, that the Spiritious particles, and what are wont to grow to them, nitro-ſulphureous and morbifick particles, are layd up, not only in the brain, but alſo in the teſticles: wherefore, if this heterogenious Copula of the Spirits, be more plentifully cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that new ſtorehouſe, from thence, the brain becoming free; often leaves the epileptical or otherways morbid diſpoſition. 2. About the time of ripe age, as the Blood pours forth ſomething before deſtinated for the brain, through the Spermatic Arteries, to the genitals, ſo alſo it receives as a recompenſe, a certain ferment from thoſe parts, through the veins: to wit, certain particles imbued with a ſeminal tincture, are caryed back into the bloody maſs, which makes it vigorous, and inſpire into it a new and lively virtue, wherefore at that time, the gifts both of the Body and minde, chiefly ſhew themſelves; Hairs break out, the voyce becomes greater, the courſes of women flow, and other accidents hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, whereby it is plain, that both the blood and nervous Juce, are impregnated with a certain freſh ferment: wherefore, the morbific ferments or ſeeds, unleſſe they be overcome by this new natural firment, they afterwards continue untame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able even to Death.</p>
                     <p>But that the Epilepſie is ſometimes cured by the help of medicines, Experience doth teſtifie: we ſhall anon diſcourſe of the method of healing, and ſhew the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the moſt famous medicines; in the mean time, as to what further belongs to the prognoſtication of this Diſeaſe, if it end not about the time of ripe age, neither can be driven away by the uſe of medicines, there happens yet a diverſe event in ſeveral ſick Patients,<note place="margin">The Epilepſie is changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes.</note> for it either ends immediatly in Death, or is changed into ſome other Diſeaſe, to wit, the Palſie, ſtupiditie, or melancholly, for the moſt part incureable.</p>
                     <p>As to the former, whenas the fits are often repeated, and every time grow more cruell, the animal function is quickly debilitated; and from thence, by the taint, by degrees brought on the Spirits, and the Nerves ſerving the Praecordia, the vital function is by little and little enervated, till at length, the whole body languiſhing, and the pulſe being looſned, and at length ceaſing, at laſt the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal flame is extinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>But that this Diſeaſe often ends in the Palſie, melancholly, or madneſſe, the reaſon is, becauſe the tone, and confirmation of the brain is depraved, by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:152521:223"/>
exploſions of the animal Spirits, and at length its natural ſtate is ſo pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, by the morbifick particles of another Kinde alſo admitted, the ſpirits are fixed, nor are any more exactly prone to exploſions, but rather ſometimes, by a contrary vice introduced, their Elaſtick virtue is too much wanting, ſo that they become dull and ſluggiſh beyond meaſure; even, as oftentimes the intempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the blood, being more cold than it ſhould be, admits the more intenſe burning of a feavour: and indeed, theſe depreſſions of the ſpirits happens partly by their own proper fault; for that their more agill particles being too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſed, the more dull or heavy are only left, and from them they are ſupplyed, but partly, as we have ſaid, they happen from the fault of the brain; for that its pores and paſſages, are ſo dilated and opened, from the often paroxiſms of this falling evill, that afterwards, there is an open paſſage made, for any hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneous, and divers kindes of morbifick particles, to enter with the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous juce.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the Diagnoſis and Prognoſis, the deſcription and judgment of the Epilepſie, or falling ſickneſſe; in the unfolding of which,<note place="margin">Of the Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory part of the Epilepſie.</note> it was neceſſary to bring reaſons not altogether abſtruſe, and different from the common Pathologie, neither are we conſtrained to receade, in the Therapeatick or Curatory part of this Diſeaſe, from the common and uſuall method of curing, in other Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: But in truth, are preſcriptions of ſuch who follow the ordinarily received Opinions, by which, for the moſt part, they endeavour to carry away, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to eradicate the morbific matter, by Catharticks only, do little or nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in the falling ſickneſs, yea they are wont frequently to be hurtfull to it. I have known ſome famous Practitioners, omitting wholly the ſeries of the Curato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intentions, betake themſelves to certain Empirical Remedies, without any foreſight of the whole: this kind of practiſe, tho ſometimes it ſucceeds happily, would much more certainly perform the propoſed cure, if the Body being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared, they ſhould in like manner take away all Impediments, by other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, the Indications concerning the Cure of the Falling Sickneſſe, ſhall be (as they are Commonly ſet down) either Curatory, which have reſpect to the Fit, and drive it away either coming on, or when upon them, to ſet it going the ſooner: or prophylactic or preventory, which have reſpect to the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe, which if they can take away, its acceſſions will be inhibited after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                     <p>A general evacuation has ſcarce any place in the former Intention, for in the fit neither a Vomit, or Purge, and very rarely the opening a veine, are wont to be adminiſtred; if the amazed Inſenſibility and diſorder continues very long, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Clyſter is wont to be uſed, but what that chiefly aimes at is, to fix the too fierce and Volatil animal Spirits, and alſo to ſuppreſs their begun Exploſions: For which ends, two kinde of Remedies chiefly are made uſe of, to wit, Firſt, ſuch as repreſs the animal ſpirits, being too apt to grow firce and to leap forth, and repell them with ſome perfume that is ingratefull to them, and Compell them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to order: which thing indeed medicines imbued with a volatile, or armoniack ſalt, or alſo with a vitriolic ſulphur do effect, of which kinde are ſalt and oyle of Amber, Spirits of Blood, Harts-horn, Sut, tincture of Caſtor, and ſuch like: for theſe being inwardly taken, or put to the noſe, often times bring help, and the evill Spirits of this Diſeaſe, are thought to be driven away, even as in <hi>Tobit,</hi> the Devill was by the fume of the gall of a fiſh. Secondly, the animal ſpirits are call'd away, or hindred from their begun exploſions, when they are allured, or held buſied in ſome work, they are accuſtomed to: wherefore, the fit urging, frictions being uſed and for ſome time continued, thorow the whole body, do often help: But ſome that ſet upright the diſeaſed, and altogether hold or reſtrain their Arms and legs, from their Convulſive motion, or hold them violently in this or that poſture; that alſo blow things into their noſes to make them ſneeſe, and power down ſtrong Cordials at the mouth, and apply either Cupping glaſſes, and Scarrifications, and handle more ſharply with other manner of adminiſtrations thoſe ſick people, and diſturb the manner of the fit, I ſay this kinde of practiſe is moſt often too roughly inſtituted or ordained: becauſe after this manner, there is a double trouble put upon nature, to wit, one from the diſeaſe, and the other not lighter from the ſtanders by, and helpers, when it were wuch better, for the Fit
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:152521:224"/>
to be ſuffer'd to paſs over after its own manner, and the ſick to endure but one trouble only.</p>
                     <p>Truly the chiefeſt care of a Phyſitian, and efficacy of medicines is uſed about the prevention of this Diſeaſe, that the cauſe being taken away, or its root cut off, all the fruits might wither; medicines requiſit to this Indication, reſpect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Intentions, which may yet be reduced, to thoſe two chief heads: to wit, in the firſt place, that the enkindling or matter of the diſeaſe, being ſupplyed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the vicious Blood, or nervous Juice, and mediately from the viſcera, and firſt paſſages, be cut off; then in the ſecond place, that the evill diſpoſition of the Brain, and the ſpirits its Inhabitants, which is peculiar to the Epilepſie, be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt Indication, here Vomits, purges, and other things, both evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, and altering, yea phlebotomy, and Cauteries, have place; for as much as by theſe means and ways, the impurites both of the viſcera, and humours are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued or brought away; and their dyſcraſie or evill diſpoſition amended: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe kinde of medicines, and medicall adminiſtrations, rarely or never cure the Epilepſie, by themſelves, yet thoſe take away impediments, ſet nature upright, and incite her to encounter her enemy; alſo, they prepare the way, that ſo ſpecific Remedies might more certainly, and efficaciouſly ſhew their virtues; wherefore uſually, whilſt they take care to cure this diſeaſe with ſecrets and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den myſteries, they make uſe of thoſe kinde of medicine between whiles, in the ſpring, and autumn, and other fit times.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly. As to ſpecific Remedies, which indeed only, though not allways, are able to reach the Epilepſie and to ſubdue it; of which ſort are the male Paeonie, Miſſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tow, Rew, Caſtor, the Claws of an Elk, preparations of a dead mans Skull, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Corrall, with many others. Foraſmuch as theſe are taken without any ſenſible evacuation, or alſo perturbation, following in the viſcera or humours, it is a wonder, by what formal reaſon, or virtue of acting, they are wont at any time to help in this diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">In what the Virtue of the ſpecificks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the Epilepſie.</note>Concerning this matter, intricate and obſcure enough, if there may be place for Conjecture, when as we have already aſſerted, the procatartick Cauſe of the Epilepſie, to conſiſt in the heterogeneous Copula, joyning or cleaving to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, inhabiting the Brain, and inciting them to praeternatural exploſions; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that thoſe things which take away, or reſiſt ſuch a cauſe, muſt be of that nature, that by ſtrengthening the brain, and binding up its pores, may exclude that Copula, and ſo fix, and as it were binde the ſpirits, flowing within the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle or marrow of the Brain, from leaving their Copula, that they ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more apt or prone, to irregular exploſions; Perhaps after the ſame manner, as when gunpowder or aurum fulminans being pounded with ſulphure, or ſprinkled with ſpirit of Vitriol loſes its thundering virtue. And indeed, theſe kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, to wit, one or both of them, may be ſuſpected, yea, in a manner detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in moſt anti-epileptick Remedies: For truly, Paeony, Misſletow, Rue, the Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the vally, with many others, abound in a certain manifeſt aſtriction, that 'tis likely, their Particles being taken inwardly, and ſo dilated to the brain, by the Vehicle of the blood, and nervous Juice, do ſo binde, and ſhut up its too looſe and open pores, that afterwards, they do not ly open, for the Paſſage of the morbifick matter: Beſides, for that theſe vapourous Concerts, breath forth as it were an armodiack ſcent or ſcattering, therefore they are ſayd to purifie the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal ſpirits, to fix them, and to ſtrengthen them, having put off their hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous Copula: This virtue purifying the ſpirits, proceeding from an armoniac ſalt, is more apparent in Remedies, which are taken from the famuly of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, and Animalls, ſuch are the preparations of the humane Skull, of blood, amber, and coral, as the other more binding, rather exiſts, in the parts and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Vegitables.</p>
                     <p>It will not be needfull here, for the curing of the Epilepſie, to propoſe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat method of healing, with exact forms of preſcriptions, becauſe there are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant every where among Authors, general precepts, and moſt choyce Remedies, and the Prudent Phyſitian will eaſily accomodate, both the Indications, and that plentifull proviſion of medicinal ſtuff, to the particular Caſes of the ſick.

                     <p>A fair maid, ſprung from parents indifferently healthfull, being her ſelf very <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſervation. </seg>1</label> well, till about her coming to ripe age, about that time, ſhe began to complain of her head being ill: And firſt of all, ſhe felt neer the fore part or her head, by fits, a Vertigo or giddineſſe, whereby all things ſeemed to run round; and alſo whilſt this Symptom continued, ſhe was wont to talke idlely, and to forget whatever ſhe had but juſt done; Theſe kinde of fits at firſt paſs'd away within a quarter of an hower, and came again only once or twice in a month, in the interval of which ſhe was well enough: Afterwards, the aſſalts being made more grievous, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, they alſo return'd more often, and within half a year, her brain being dayly more weakened, this giddineſſe or turning round, was plainly chang'd into the Epilepſie, that the ſick being ſtruck down to the ground, at every fit, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Inſenſibility, and horrid convulſions, and alſo with foam at the mouth. The Domeſticks obſerv'd, that ſhe allways fell on the ſame ſide, ſo that ſiting neer the fire, if ſhe ſate in the right Corner ſhe would be flung in the midſt of the fire, but if in the left Corner, ſhe fell againſt the wall of the Chimny: once when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left alone in the houſe, ſhe fell upon the burning Coals, and ſo miſerably burnt her face, and forepart of her head, that the skull being made bare of the skin and fleſh, a deep and large eſcar was burnt into it: and afterwards the outer ſhell of it fell off a hands bredth. In the mean time the ſick maid, ſo long as the ulcers contracted by the burning, ran with filthy matter, ſhe was free from the fits, but afterwards, they being healed up, the falling evill returned: This Diſeaſe began firſt to ſhew it ſelf about the time of puberty, for this maid, preſently after the begining of it, had her Courſes, and afterwards they conſtantly obſerved their ſet times, though her diſtemper grew dayly worſe: Various kinds of medicines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adminiſtred to this ſick Creature, availed nothing, becauſe it was the cuſtome and practiſe, of her, and her friends, quickly to change both the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and method of Phyſick, if an happy event did not preſently follow, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves very much to every Empirick, and outlandiſh Mountebanks.</p>
                     <p>That in this Caſe, the Vertigenous Diſtemper, with a ſhort delirium, was the forerunner of the Epilepſie, it plainly argues, the original of this Diſeaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing planted in the middle of the brain, to depend upon a certain inordination of the Spirits; to wit, thoſe dwelling there, at the begining, begun to admit an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous Copula; which being more plentifully heaped up, being moved ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of its own accord, or occaſionally, while it was ſhaken off, induced, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſpirits being diſturbed, and not yet very exploſive thoſe former diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; Afterwards, from the ſame cauſe, by degrees growing worſe, the pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations of the Spirits did raiſe up their manifeſt exploſions, and chang'd the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigo, and <hi>Delirium,</hi> into the Epilepſie.</p>

                        <hi>CHAPTER IV.</hi> Of other kinds of Convulſions, and firſt of the Convulſive Motions of Children.</head>
                     <p>AFter the Epilepſie, as it were the principal Spaſm, in the chief place excited, to wit, within the middle part of the brain, the other Kindes of Convulſions come to be treated of in order. The differences of thoſe, are beſt taken from a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold kinde of cauſe, and the various manners, and accidents of either. We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhown, that all Spaſmodic diſtempers, do flow, either from the meer irritation of the ſpirits or from their exploſion, by reaſon of the cleaving of an Elaſtick <hi>Copula</hi> to them, or jointly from both, together: wherefore, the manifold Ideas of Spaſms, may be diſtinguiſhed, and diſtributed into certain Claſſes, as it happens for this, or that cauſe, or either together, to remain in the various places of the <hi>Encepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> or the nervous Appendix. For indeed, the Spaſmodic matter, or the explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Copula of the Spirits, finding a paſſage chiefly, and moſt often thorow the Brain, and ſometimes in ſome meaſure thorow the extremities of the nerves, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts either about the origine of the nerves, or their middle proceſſes, or their outmoſt ends, or abounds in their whole paſſages, as ſhall be by and by more particularly declared: Further, an irritation ſtiring up Convulſions by it ſelf, or with a previous remote cauſe, although it be made every where in the nervous ſtock, yet it chiefly, and more frequently produces ſuch an effect, about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginings, middle proceſſes, and foldings, or ends of the Nerves. But the ſame Kinde of Cauſe and effects, are after one manner in Infants and children, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in youths, and thoſe of riper age. Since therefore we have determined, particularly to conſider, all the kindes of Convulſions, we will firſt diſcourſe of the Convulſive motions of Infants, and Children.</p>
                     <p>Infants, and children, happen ſo ordinarily, and frequently to be tormented with Spaſmodick Diſtempers, that this is reconed the chief, and almoſt the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kinde of Convulſions; for the Symptoms of this kinde, in other more ripe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are wont to be called by other known Names, and referred to the Epilepſie, hyſterick, hypochondriac, Collie paſſions, or alſo to the Scurvie: but in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they are called, as it were by way of Excellency, Convulſions.</p>
                     <p>As to this we muſt obſerve, that children are found to be greatly obnoxious to Convulſions, chiefly about two ſeaſons, to wit, within the firſt month after they are born, or about their breeding of Teeth: Although it often happens, that the aſſaults of this Diſeaſe, may come alſo at other times, and from certain other Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place therefore, it very often happens, that children newly born, or at leaſt er'e they are two months old, are afflicted at every turn with Spaſms, excited in divers parts; for that inverſions of the eyes, diſtortions of the cheeks, and Lipps, or tremblings, yea Contractions of the Tendons, and frequent jerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or leapings forth of the members, and ſudden ſhakings of the whole Body, infeſt them; and that the ſame effect likewiſe ſometimes afflicts the praecordia, appears plain enough, becauſe whilſt the Spaſms buſie the Limbs, and outward members, alſo the face becomes now pale, now of a livid, or dead Colour, from the blood ſtagnating in the heart, and the Lungs being at that time contracted. As therefore, Spaſms are wont to infeſt three Regions of the Body in children, to wit, the parts of the head and face, the outward members and Limbs, and the Praecordia and viſcera, we obſerve now theſe regions, now thoſe, now, two or all together to be poſſeſſed, by the morbific Cauſe, to wit, as it is fixed, either about the beginings, or ends of the nerves; and when the former of theſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:152521:227"/>
as the ſuperior part of the oblong pith, the middle, or the loweſt part of the ſpinal marrow, is touch'd, one, or more parts together, are aſſaulted by the morbifick Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>As to the other Cauſes of this Diſtemper, to wit, the procataric and evident, thoſe of the former Kinde, do chiefly conſiſt in two things, firſt that all the parts of the Head in infants are very weak, and abound with a viſcous humidity; to wit, the Brain leſs firm, and the tone of the nerves very looſe, ſo that they are not able to bear the more light force of every matter, but the Spirits inhabiting them, are eaſily incited into irregular motions or Spaſms, by the proper liquour, wherewith thoſe parts are watered, if it flows never ſo little immoderately, or at leaſt more plentifully, than for the meaſure of ſo little ſtrength. But in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, becauſe it appears by obſervation, that children, not only, nor all, who are of a more tender Conſtitution, are found to be prone to this Diſeaſe, therefore, this ought to be rather accounted for a reaſon, of the more remote morbid Cauſe, that the Blood, and nervous Juce, are originally vicious, in ſome Infants, by reaſon of evills contracted from the womb: For that the ſanguineous maſs, wanting eventilation for many months paſt, becomes impure in children newly born; wherefore, broad and Red puttings forth, like the ſmall pocks, ſhew themſelves through the whole skin, in moſt children, ſoon after they are born; to which ſort of wealks, or effloreſcences, if they are hindred, or repreſſed, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dangerous exulcerations, about the parts of the mouth follow. Hence we may deſervedly ſuſpect, ſuch impurities of the blood, ſometimes to be poured forth into the brain, and nervous ſtock, conſidering their debility, and for that reaſon Spaſmodic Diſtempers to ariſe; to wit, whilſt the blood being vitious from the womb, endeavours to purifie it ſelf, it transfers its faeculencies into the head, which were wont to be exterminated by the putting forth the Red-gum, or red ſpreadings thorow the skin: Wherefore, a water now thin, and Serous, now thick and ſticking, and either participating of praeternatural Salts and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phures, is layd up within theſe or thoſe receſſes, and Cavities of the Brain, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebel, and oblong pith, the recrements of which, when they begirt the beginings, or ends of this or that nerve, and ſometimes many together, affix on the Spirits inhabiting them, heterogeneous particles, and apt for Spaſmodic or Convulſive exploſions. For as ſoon as the nerves have deeply imbibed ſuch particles, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits being burthened with their Copula, endeavour either of their own accord, or being incited by evident Cauſes, to thruſt, and ſhake it off; and ſo they enter into Spaſmodic, or Convulſive exploſions.</p>
                     <p>The evident Cauſes, which bring on Convulſive motions in children praediſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, are of two Kindes, <hi>viz.</hi> In the firſt place, whatſoever ſtir up unwonted efferveſcencies of the blood, whether they be exceſſes of heat or cold, a too plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull nouriſhment, or hotter then ſhould be, the changes of the air, and weather, and chiefly the periodical times of the Moon; for by reaſon of theſe, and other the like occaſions, the Blood growing more hot than by right it ſhould be, affixes ſooner to the Spirits an heterogeneous Copula, even to a fullneſs, and cauſes it preſently to be ſtruck off, and exploded, by them throughly diſturbed. 2ly. An Irritation, in almoſt every part of the nervous Syſtem, does not ſeldome bring into Act, a Spaſmodic or Convulſive Diſpoſition: wherefore, not only an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of tangible qualities, outwardly inflicted, but the milk Coagulated in the ſtomack, choler, or other ſharp humours, or alſo wormes knawing the Inteſtines, are wont to excite Spaſms or Convulſions: Beſides, theſe kinde of evident Cauſes, as they are ſtronger, ſometimes induce Spaſmodick Diſtempers of themſelves, and without a praevious Diſpoſition: even ſo worms, and perchance ſharp humours, cauſe Convulſive motions to ſome children, at leaſt to the more tender.</p>
                     <p>That it might more certainly, and to the ſenſe appear, what kinde of morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic matter might be in Convulſive motions, I have opened the dead bodies of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which this diſeaſe had oppreſt: I have allways in vain ſought the cauſe, within the Viſecra, and firſt paſſages of Concoction; In the heads of many, a ſerous water being heaped up, within the Cavity, under the Cerebel, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtending the Membrane which cloaths the oblong pith or marrow, did overflow the beginings of the nerves: in ſome, no footſteps of this Diſeaſe appeared: ſo that, what ſticking to the Spirits did irritate them into exploſions, was of ſo imperceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a bulk, and its originall ſo altogether hid, that it could not be found out,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:152521:227"/>
by the moſt perſpicatious ſcrutiny of the ſight. Sometime paſt, in this City, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny chilbren of a certain woman dyed of this Diſeaſe, at length, the fourth, as the others, dyed within the month; we diſſected the Head, and here no ſerous Collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies or water did overflow the ventricles, but only the ſubſtance of the Brain, and its appendix, was moiſter then ordinary, and looſer; what was moſt worthy of obſervation was, that in the Cavity, which lyes under the Cerebel, upon the trunk of the oblong pith, we found a remarkable heap of clotter'd, and as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted blood: but in truth it is uncertain, whether this matter, depoſited there from the begining, had primarily cauſed the convulſions; or rather, whether this blood being extravaſated, and expreſſed, by the contraction of the parts, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted round about, was not the effect, and product of the Convulſions, and not the cauſe of them; for alſo in Apoplectical people this kinde of Phaenomenon ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily happens, which yet we ſhall afterwards ſhew, to be rather the effect, than the cauſe of the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, the heterogeneous Particles, which flow to the blood, from the womb, are wont to be ſent away through efflorencies or Cutaneous Puſtles in the whole Body, in many children, in others being poured on the head, are the material cauſe of the Convulſive Diſtemper, may be inferr'd, beſides the reaſons before recited, from the remedies chiefly helping: For that in little children obnoxious to this haereditarie Diſeaſe, the Convulſive fits are beſt prevented, if that an iſſue be made Preſently after they are born, in the nape of the neck, and blood drawn with a Leech from the jugular Veins; for the corruptions of the nervous juce, are brought away by that, and the impure buddings of the blood, are diverted from the head by this: by theſe ways of Adminiſtrations, when before two or three children, of the ſame Parent, have dyed of Convulſions, ſoon after they were born, all the reſt have been freed from the ſame evill.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly. Thus much concerning the Convulſive motions of Children, which are wont to infeſt them, by reaſon of an Infection contracted from the womb. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>f that at this bout they ſhould eſcape the Diſeaſe it ſelf, or at leaſt its deadly ſtrokes, nevertheleſs, about rhe time of breeding teeth, they would be found at laſt to be obnoxious, to the ſame danger: for when the Teeth, eſpecially the greater, are about to cut, oftentimes a feavour is excited, to which not ſeldom Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are Joyned: and though at this Time, children are grown ſtronger, and may better bear the fits of the diſeaſe, then when new born, yet the convulſive Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, now ſtirred up by no other grievous occaſion, becomes very dangerous, and ſometimes deadly.</p>
                     <p>But foraſmuch as childern, who fall into feavours, about the time of breeding of Teeth, are not all tormented with Convulſions, it therefore follows, that ſome diſpoſition to this diſeaſe, either innate, or acquired, doth precede; and that the pain cauſed from the breeding the Teeth, is to be eſteemed only the means of a more ſtrong evident Cauſe, to wit, Children, who being indued either with a Cacochymia, or juce cauſing ill digeſtion, or with a more weak conſtitution of the brain, and nervous ſtock, have their animal Spirits too much adulterated, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipable, are ſometimes diſpoſed for the coming of Convulſive diſtempers: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when ſo acute pain, together with a feavor, afflicts, that latent diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is brought into Act.</p>
                     <p>If it be here ask'd, for what reaſon a feavour, and then Convulſive motions following thereupon, come to thoſe Praediſpoſed, in teething, it may be anſwer'd, that either effect may be attributed to the pain, as the immediate Cauſe: We ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally know by our ſelves; what the torment is, that follows an irritation about the roots of the Teeth; in truth ſo great, and ſo cruell, that a more cruell can ſcarce be; for that one or two notable ſhoots, of the 5th pare of nerves, reaches to the roots of each Tooth, which when it ss hauled by the ſharp particles of the Blood, or other humours, there layd up, cauſes a moſt ſharp ſenſe of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or pain, by its Corrugation: But this kinde of Vellication or hauling of this Nerve, happens thus to children breeding teeth, becauſe that the membranes and fibres, are every way diſtended, by the Teeth, now increaſing into a greater bulk, and as yet included within the ſcarce hollow gums: hence the blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hindred in its Circulation, cauſes a tumour, and ſo preſſes the nerves, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo pours on them the more ſharp particles of the Serum, by which, being nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pulled or hauled, they are tormented with Corrugations, and painfull Spaſms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:152521:228"/>Therefore, when ſo cruel pains happen to children, from their breeding Teeth, it is no wonder if a feavour, and alſo Convulſive motions ſometimes follow: the former of theſe happens, both for as much as the blood being hindred about the pained part, is not circulated with its wonted and equall courſe, wherefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes inordinatly moved, in the whole Body; and beſides, becauſe Spaſms being ſtirred up ſomewhere in the nervous ſtock, the corrugated and contracted nerves, preſſe together, and pull the Arteries, and by that reaſon, ſtir up irregular and feavouriſh fluctuations in the Blood. But ſometimes Couvulſions happen in breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Teeth, both becauſe the blood growing hot, ſends forth heterogeneous par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, to the animal government, and ſo ſtirs up the ſpirits into exploſions; and beſides alſo, when this acute pain, and as it were a Lancing, follows upon the teeth being about to cut, it communicates a very troubleſome and irritative ſenſe, from the affected parts, to the firſt ſenſorie, preſently from thence, the motion of the rage is retorted, by the ſame or other neighbour nerves, which by reaſon of a praevious diſpoſition, doth not rarely become convulſive.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe two occaſions of Convulſions (which are wont to be chiefly, and more often in children) to wit, the times of Infancy, and breeding Teeth, this Diſtemper alſo is excited at other Times very often, and for other Cauſes: For in whom the Seeds of the Spaſmodick Diſpoſition is ſown, they ſometimes unſold themſelves preſently after the birth, and are ripened into morbid fruit; or elſe lying hid for a while, they now come before the breeding of Teeth, and follow a long time after it; and by reaſon of other evident cauſes, to wit, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, or Internal; of which ſort are a ſickly, or breeding nurſe, milk Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſtomack, or degenerating into an acid or bitter putrifection, a feavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh diſtemperature of the head, Ulcers or wealks of other parts ſuddenly vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Changes of the aire, the Conjunctions, oppoſitions, and aſpects of the Sun, and moon, and ſuch like; they at length break forth into Act, from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain event. Concerning theſe, there is no need, that we ſhould particularly diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>When all the Children, of a man dwelling in the neighbourhood, dyed of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, within the ſpace of three months, at length, to prevent that fatal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, they ſought for remedies, for a child newly born: I being ſent for, a few days after the being brought to bed, firſt adviſed the making an Iſſue in the nape of the neck, then, that the next day after, a leech being applyed to the jugular veine of each ſide, two ounces of blood ſhould be taken away: beſides, that about every conjunction, or oppoſite aſpect of the Sun, and moon, about five grains of the following powder ſhould be given, in a ſpoonfull of Julap, for three days, morning and evening. Take of humane Skull prepared, of the root of the male Paeonie, each <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> i. of the powder of Pearls <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ſs. of white ſugar <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> i. mingle them, and make a very fine powder: Take of the waters of Black Cherries ℥ iii. of the antiepileptic of Langius ℥ i. of the Syrrop of the flowers of the male Paeonie <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> vi. mingle them; alſo I order'd that the nurſe at the ſame times, ſhould take a draught of whey, or poſſet drink, in which were boyled, the ſeeds and roots of the male Paeonie, and the leaves of the Lilly of the Vally, the Infant for about four months was well, but then began to be troubled with Convulſions: at which time, the ſame Remedies being adminiſtred both to the child, and to the nurſe, in a larger doſe, veſicatories alſo were applyed behind the eares, and blood was taken by the ſucking of a Leech, from the jugular veins: within two or three days the child grew well: afterwards, whenever within four or five months the Convulſions return'd, it was cured again, by the uſe of the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. After half a year, the Convulſive motions wholly ceaſed, but a painfull Tumour aroſe, about the lower part of the <hi>Spinae dorſi</hi> or back-bone, from which proceeded a certain diſtortion of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> or joynts of the back bone, and a weakneſs of the legs, and at length a Palſie. It ſeems in this caſe, that the Spaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic or Convulſive matter, being wont to come upon the brain firſt, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the nerves, entring at laſt the Spinal marrow, and being thruſt out at its further end, it wholly ſtopt up the heads of the appending nerves, and ſhut out the paſſage of the Spirits: to wit, becauſe other narcotick, and more thick, had joyned themſelves, to the exploſive particles.</p>

                     <p>ALthough Convulſive Diſtempers, which happen to thoſe of riper years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known by other Names, alſo are commonly reputed of ſome other ſtock, and are wont to be referr'd to the paſſions called Hyſterical, Hypochondriacal, or Colical, or to the Scorbute; yet if the matter be a little better conſider'd, it will eaſily appear, that ſome Convulſive Symptoms, both in Men and Women, do come from the Brain, which Convulſions properly and truly challenge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Name: But theſe (as we have already mentioned) may be diſtinguiſhed after a various manner, by the manifold ſeat of the morbifick Cauſe, but chiefly into theſe three kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> Into Spaſms or Convulſions ſtirred up, by reaſon of the origine of the Nerves being chiefly affected; into others being ſtirred up,<note place="margin">Three kinds of Convulſions hapning to thoſe of riper years.</note> by reaſon of the extremities or ends of the Nerves, being poſſeſſed by the morbifick matter; and laſtly into ſuch, from whoſe head the morbific matter deſcending, fills the whole paſſages, or the moſt part, of ſome certain Nerves, or of all together.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, that we may proceed, to unfold the Convulſions,<note place="margin">Diſtempers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the Nervous origine diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</note> ariſing from the beginnings of the Nerves being affected, take notice here, that the morbifick matter beſeiging the beginnings of the Nerves, doth ſometimes chiefly flow into the firſt pair of Nerves, to wit, which reſpect the Muſcles of the eyes and face, and from thence the contractions, and tremblings, now of the Noſe, Cheeks, or Lips, now of the Eyes, or the diſtortions of the mouth, follow. Secondly,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>1</hi> According to the various Nerves being affected.</note> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the wandring and intercoſtal pair do chiefly imbibe the Heterogeneous par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; and then Inflations, or Contractions of the Abdomen, and Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, and alſo the palpitation of the Heart, trembling, difficult and interrupted breathing, an intermitting pulſe, and other Symptoms of the middle, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Belly, do very much infeſt. Thirdly, but ſometimes the morbifick Cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed lower, affects chiefly the ſpinal marrow, and therefore the outward members, and limbs, are rendred obnoxious to inordinate leapings forth, and contractions: Further, in very many Caſes of this nature, becauſe the Animal ſpirits being exploſed about the origine of the Nerves, do inordinately leap back towards the <hi>Encephalon;</hi> for that reaſon, to all Convulſions almoſt being excited by this means, the <hi>Vertigo,</hi> alſo the ſcotomie or giddineſs, the tingling of the eares, and ſometimes the amaſed Inſenſibility or falling down of the Spirits, are joyned, or follow.</p>
                     <p>But as we may Conjecture, from the various figures of the Convulſive diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, it ſeems, that the Convulſive matter hauling thoſe, or theſe nerves,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> According to the Various places of the ſame Nerves being affected.</note> or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them together, is lodged either about their beginings, only, ſo that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in that place being often exploſed, a frequent and very troubleſome Vertigo ariſes, beſides tremblings, and a ſhort faintneſs about the Praecordia, ſwoonings, and often leapings, and light contractions in the Viſcera, or muſcles are felt. Or Secondly, the exploſive particles being dilated to the beginings of the nerves, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:152521:230"/>
more deeply into their proceſſes, and not ſeldom being ſlidden down into the nervous foldings, belonging to the Praecordia, or the Viſcera of the lower belly, or alſo to the exterior members, procure there, other as it were neſts of Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive diſtempers, that as often as the Spirits about the nervous origine, are driven into exploſions, preſently, fits as it were hyſterical, aſthmatical, or otherways Convulſive, ariſe in the Abdomen, Thorax, or Limbs: Examples of theſe, and by what means they are made, ſhall be anon more clearly delivered: In the mean time, the ſpaſmodic matter, flowing into the pipes of the Nerves, when it is transfer'd even to their proceſſes and remote enfoldings, yet, foraſmuch as it hath ſtill its chief mine about the nervous original, therefore after very grievous Convulſions of the Viſcera or members, a great perturbation of the Brain follows thereupon, with a tingling of the eares, a vertigo, and often an Inſenſibility or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſed excurtion of Spirits: but ſometimes the morbific matter, as to the greateſt part, being tranſlated to the fartheſt ends of the nerves, from thence they become free or clear about their beginings: For I have obſerved many, who, whilſt at the begining, they were infeſted with the vertigo, often fainting away with fear, head-ach, and heavyneſſe about the hinder part of the head, to have felt about the <hi>Praecordia</hi> or <hi>viſcera,</hi> only light inflations, or tremblings; but afterwards, ſuffering more cruel Convulſions about theſe parts, they did not complain of the former diſtempers of the Head.</p>

                        <note place="margin">By what maens the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive matter flows into the Nerves.</note>If it ſhould be further demanded, concerning the Convulſive matter, from what place it ſhould be brought, and by what ways carried towards the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Nerves, and what kinde of Settlement, and as it were cheriſhing neſts it there obtains; we ſay, that although we cannot detect the footſteps, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt paſſages of this matter, yet ſo much may be collected from certain obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the analogie of things, it may be ſuppoſed there are theſe two diſtinct manner of paſſages, whereby the Convulſive particles, being firſt poured out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Brain and Cerebel, from the blood, are from thence carried towards the beginings of the Nerves: <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt ſometimes this matter being imbibed by the Brain and Cerebel, and by degrees paſſing thorow, the pores of either, ſlides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Trunk of the oblong marrow, whoſe tract being alſo overcome by it, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the nervous juice, it ſlides forward towards the original of the Nerves, and is heaped up neer their heads, or within the medullarie trunk it ſelf, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the annularie Prominencies, in which places, either a long while ſubſiſting, it ſtirs up frequent <hi>Vertigoes,</hi> and more light Convulſions, in remote parts as hath been ſaid; or being ſlidden from thence, more deeply into the paſſages of the nerves, excites fits of Convulſions very Cruel: ſuch a progreſs of the morbific Cauſe, we ſuſpect in whom the Vertigo, ſwooning, heavineſs of the head, and torpor of the minde, go before the Convulſive aſſalts: Indeed, the matter of the diſeaſe, abounding as yet in the brain and marrowy Appendix, produces theſe kinds of previous diſtempers; which being ſlidden from thence, into the Nerves, cauſes Convulſions.</p>
                     <p n="2">2dly, There is yet another way, whereby it plainly appears, that the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cauſe of the Convulſive Diſtemper, is transferred, to the beginnings of the Nerves; to wit, when the ſame being depoſited by the <hi>ſerous water</hi> within the Cavities, or ventricles of the Head, it is inſinuated into the Neighbouring roots of the Nerves: For in <hi>Chronical</hi> Diſeaſes, when the remarkable diſcraſie of the blood and humours, happens alſo to be accompanied with a praved diſpoſition of the brain, oftentimes a great plenty of ſharp <hi>ſerum,</hi> infeſting the Nervous ſtock, dropping forth from the Veſſells of the <hi>Choroeidan,</hi> or retiform enfoldings, ſlides into the ventricles of the brain, and its Appendix: But this ſerous water, afterwards breaking thorow the under-ſpreading of the <hi>Cerebell,</hi> into the fourth ventricle, the little skin there being diſplaced, whereby the oblong marrow is uncovered, it falls upon the beginnings of one or more of the Nerves, and either by irritating, or imbuing them, with Heterogeneous and exploſive particles, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the Convulſive diſpoſition. And this for the moſt part is the cauſe, that ſick people, after long and ill handled Feavours, alſo after the more grievous <hi>Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic</hi> Diſeaſes, at length dye of Convulſions; as I have found, by the frequent Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie of the Carcaſes, of thoſe who dyed by that means. Alſo it appears by ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomical Obſervation, that the brain may be overflowed by a certain ſerous water, without the diſtemper of the Convulſive diſpoſition; and further that in ſome,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:152521:230"/>
who dyed of the Epilepſie, and other Convulſive diſeaſes, there was no deluge of the <hi>ſerum,</hi> within the ventricles of the brain: By which it is given us to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that the Convulſive diſtempers, do not flow only from the waterie matter in the Head; but that they ariſe not at all from ſuch a cauſe, unleſs the <hi>ſerous</hi> water, overflowing the <hi>ventricles</hi> of the Brain, and chiefly that underlaying of the <hi>Cerebel,</hi> be imbued with heterogeneous and exploſive particles. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber once, my Councel to be ask'd for a young man labouring with an Egregious Phtiſis, and at that time truly deſperate, beſides a cough, and ſhortneſſe of Breath, he had grievouſly complained for many days, yea weeks, that he could not lye upon his back in his Bed, or whilſt he ſat in a chair, he could not lean his head backwards: for that by this, or that poſture of his Body, he was wont preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuffer tremblings of his heart, and a fainting of the Spirits, as if he were juſt about to dye: wherefore of neceſſity he was fain to hold his head upright, or leaning forward. After he was dead, his carcaſe being diſſected, his Lungs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared all over tumified, and in ſome places Ulcerated: then his Skull being open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there flowed within all the <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the brain, a great quantity of yellow and ſalt <hi>Serum:</hi> which water certainly whilſt it did ſlide forward upon the fourth <hi>Ventricle,</hi> about the Trunk of the oblong marrow, his head leaning back, ruſhing upon the heads of the wandring, and intercoſtal pair of nerves, did ſtir up the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Convulſions about the <hi>Praecordia:</hi> but ſo long as his head was inclined for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that the heap of <hi>ſerum</hi> flowed back into the anterior <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the Brain, the origine of the nerves remained free from that Convulſive matter.</p>
                     <p>Having hitherto ſhown, how many ways, and by what paſſages, the morbific matter, being dilated towards the origine of the Nerves, ſeems to bring on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, it were eaſie, according to theſe reaſons, to unfold many Convulſive Symptoms: for beſides the Convulſive motions of Infants, and children, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times excited from the ſame kinde of Cauſes, hither may be referr'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, and ſudden leapings forth of the nervous parts, which follow upon fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. As alſo thoſe paſſions commonly called <hi>Hyſterical,</hi> alſo <hi>hypocondriacal,</hi> and certain others, proceed not ſeldom from the <hi>morbific</hi> Cauſe, ruſhing upon the beginings of the Nerves. We will therefore endeavour to eſtabliſh the truth of this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> by ſome other Hiſtories, and examples, of Sick people; but in the firſt place, we will propoſe obſervations of that Kinde, in whom the morbific matter, ſetling upon the beginings of the nerves, and not being as yet ſlid deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into their proceſſes, induced frequent <hi>vertigos,</hi> and only more light Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> and <hi>Praecordia.</hi>

                     <p>As to the Reaſon of the aforeſaid ſickneſſe, without doubt it ſeems, that thoſe Diſtempers were excited, by the ſerous colluvies, layd up within the Bounds of the Head: for the tranſlation of that humour into the head, brought at firſt both the Diſeaſe, and the Secretion or flowing of it out, thorow the Emunctuaries of the ear, took away all the Symptoms: Beſides, when the morbific matter had brought in to the Spirits, planted about the beginings of the nerves, a Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſomewhat exploſive, they, though being ſtruck as it were with madneſs, they were continually troubled, yet ſo long as leaping back towards the Brain, they obtained a ſpace, in which they might be more freely expanded or ſtretched forth, they did indeed only more vehemently exerciſe the Phantaſie, and without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble did only cauſe watchings. But, when by ſleep ſometimes Creeping upon her,, the excurſion of the unquiet Spirits were reſtrained towards the Brain, (which indeed neceſſarily happens, when we ſleep, the nervous Liquor within the pores of the brain, at that time being more plentifully admitted) they tumultuarily ruſhing upon the heads of the wandring pair, and intercoſtall Nerves, troubled the whole <hi>ſeries</hi> of Spirits, flowing within the paſſages of thoſe Nerves, and ſo cauſed the aforeſaid Convulſions, about the <hi>Praecordia, Viſcera,</hi> and muſcles of the Throat.

                     <p>Therefore, as to the particular reaſons, both of the diſeaſe, and ſymptoms, it ſeems, that the aforeſaid Virgin, by her ſedentary Life, (ſhe being deprived altogether of the exerciſe of the body, and the uſe of a more free Air,) but chiefly by her nightly watchings, and being frequently interrupted of her ſleep, ſhe had contracted a vitious diſpoſition of the blood, and humours, and alſo a praved and weak conſtitution of the brain, and Nervous ſtock (to which may be added, that ſhe did perpetually attend on a maſter, ſick of moſt grievous diſtempers of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, and by that means, had received perchance ſome contagion, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive Infection: And firſt of all indeed, the Heterogeneous particles being pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth, together with the nervous juce, into the brain and Cerebel, and there cleaving to the ſpirits, as it were skirmiſhed with the preliminarie ſcotomie, and vertigenous diſtemper; then the convulſive matter, ſettling upon the beginnings of the wandring pair and intercoſtal Nerves, and the ſpinal marrow, brought in, with the Vertigo, the leaping of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> and Muſcles, and their lighter ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings: Afterwards, when entring more deeply the pipes of the Nerves, it was carried into the Cervicall, and Cardiac, and perhaps intercoſtal, and other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foldings, and embued the ſpirits, performing the office of reſpiration, and the pulſe, with an exploſive <hi>Copula;</hi> they being brought into exploſions at every turn, together with their ſuperiors, inhabiting the nervous origine, by reaſon of fullneſs, or becauſe of irritation, excited moſt horrid Convulſions of the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive parts: But the fit growing ſtrong, from the pneumonic or breathing Nerves being ſtrictly bound, the ſudden inordinate ſyſtole of the Thorax, was ſtirred up; then preſently, the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> being ſuddenly, and vehemently drawn back, the obſtreperous ejulation did ſucceed: Further, when by reaſon of the ſyſtole of the Thorax, being ſometime continued, the blood being hindred, that it could not move, it <hi>ſtagnated</hi> altogether in the <hi>praecordia,</hi> therefore, during the fit, that great oppreſſion of the heart, with want of ſpeech and motion afflicted the ſick maid: But in the mean time, while as yet the region of the brain remained free, and clear from the exploſions of the ſpirits, the ſick party remained in her ſenſes, or memory: but afterwards when the Convulſive matter being dayly increaſed, it was unfolded in the middle or marrowy parts, of the debilitated and broken brain, to the former paſſions, about the <hi>praecordia,</hi> came alſo the Inſenſibility and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedneſs of ſpirits, then the Epilepſie, and laſtly madneſſe, for the reaſons before recited.

acted, ſhe remained however affected with an heavineſs, and torpor of her head, in ſome meaſure: but about noon, all the clouds being diſcuſſed, ſhe was wont to obtain a fair, and ſcrene diſpoſition of her whole head, untill the next morning, the ſame Symptoms would return again.</p>
                     <p>Who ſhall rightly weigh theſe Symptoms, need not ſuppoſe them vapours, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the womb, or ſpleen, and in thoſe ſeek for the morbific cauſe in vain: which truly may more certainly be placed in the head it ſelf: for it ſeems, that by reaſon of a great ſadneſs (which happens often to women) at the beginning, a great debility, together with a vitious taint, was impreſſed on her brain; ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that the animal ſpirits derived to the brain and Cerebell, brought with them, heterogeneous particles, of a mixt kinde, <hi>viz.</hi> Partly narcotick of ſtupifying, and partly exploſive or ruſhing forth: which kinde of Copula, when they had more plentifully conceived, through ſleep, they were ſtirred up to the ſhaking of it of, by mere fullneſs: as ſoon therefore, as the woman was awakened, the ſame ſpirits, being moved, either a bending downward being made below, they were depreſſed upon the beginnings of the Nerves, and there being exploſed, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Convulſions of the <hi>viſcera;</hi> or leaping back towards the middle of the brain, and being there ſtruck off, they brought in thoſe frequent and terrible Inſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. In truth, this diſtemper was ſomewhat akin to the Epilepſie, but that the morbific matter was not as yet ſtayed within the regal palace of the brain, or its middle part, ſo that there it might infect the ſpirits, within their Fountains; but yet, the ſame heterogeneous Copula, did cleave more ſtrictly to them, diſſociated or disjoyned below, and dividing themſelves into various and leſſer rivolets, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beginnings of the Nerves. In the mean time, the ſpirits, whereby they might ſhake off that matter, being often exploſed, cauſed the ſtupor, and Inſenſibility, but bending to ſome other place, they ruſhed upon the beginnings of the Nerves, for that reaſon caus'd thoſe Spaſms or Convulſions of the <hi>viſcera:</hi> But that the fits come only in the morning, after a plentiful ſleep, the reaſon was becauſe the heterogeneous Copula of the ſpirits, coming to them with the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous juce, was at that time gathered together to a fit fulneſs for exploſions, which being then wholly ſhaken off, the ſick perſon remained therefore all the reſt of the day, free from the diſtemper, till the next day, when the nights ſleep had brought to the head, a new ſupplement of morbific matter, the like fit returned in the morning; which perhaps, as the ſleep had been ſhorter or longer, was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved now within the brain, now near the nervous origine.</p>
                     <p>But it may be obſerv'd, that Convulſions have ariſen, from the nervous origine,<note place="margin">An Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as it wre hyſterical in a man.</note> being chiefly affected, not only in the female ſex, as the weaker and more lyable, but ſometimes, theſe kinds of diſtempers have been excited in men, from the like <hi>procatartic</hi> cauſe. Some years ſince, being haſtily ſent for from a ſtranger, who lodged in this Citty, at firſt ſight, I ſuſpected that he was poſſeſs'd, and believ'd that he had more need of Exorciſms, than of Medicines. He was about Forty years old, who had now for about three years, at certain ſet times of the year, been wont to be troubled with convulſive Motions; whilſt he by chance lodg'd here, for a few days about his occaſions, by reaſon of a great ſadneſs, he had a fit of his ſickneſs greater than uſuall: He was wont for two or three days before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, to feel the coming of his diſeaſe; to wit, from a great commotion within the forepart of the head, almoſt a continual <hi>Vertigo,</hi> and frequent dimneſs of his eyes: But the fit coming on him, at firſt his eyes were variouſly roled about, and inverted, then a certain bulk, like a living animal, was ſeen to creep from the bottom of his belly upwards, towards his heart and breaſt, and from thence to his head: I my ſelf preſſing his belly, with my hand, felt very plainly this kinde of motion, and as long as I hindred this round thing from aſcending, with both my hands, and all my ſtrength, he found himſelf indifferently well; but as ſoon as this ſwelling creeping upwards by degrees, had reached the head, preſently the members of the whole body were cruelly pull'd together, that he would daſh himſelf againſt the walls, or poſts, as if poſſeſt by an evill ſpirit; He could hardly be held, and reſtrain'd, by four ſtrong men, with all their force, but that he would leap from them, and fling out his arms, feet, and head, here and there, with divers manners of motions: when he ceaſed from leaping forth, or ſtrugling, his members would be ſtrongly extended, and his muſcles ſtiff, as if troubled with the Cramp, or ſtiff extenſion: ſuch a fit would laſt about a quarter of an hour, then
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:152521:233"/>
coming to himſelf, he would talk ſoberly, and walk about in his Chamber; he knew what he had ſuffer'd, and ask'd pardon of the ſtanders by, preſently after, he began to draw his eyes inward, and ſwiftly to role them about: then preſently the convulſive diſtemper returning, acted the like Tragedy as before: and after this manner, he would have five or ſix of theſe kinde of convulſive fits, within three hours ſpace. In the midſt of one of theſe fits, a vein in his Arm being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and a large orifice made, the blood flowed out ſlowly, and was ſeen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to be congealed: and ſo indeed, that being received into the diſh, it did not flow about, after the manner of Liquors, with a plain and equal <hi>ſuperficies,</hi> but like melted fewet, drop'd into a cold veſſell, one drop being heaped upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it grew to a heap.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The reaſon of the aforeſaid Caſe,</note>If this ſtrange diſtemper had hapned to a woman, it would preſently have been ſaid, that it was the mother, or hiſterical, and the Cauſe of it would have been laid on the fault of the womb; eſpecially, for that the aſcent of ſomething, like a bulk, began the fit, from the bottom of the belly: But when this common ſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which moſt often is the mere ſubterfuge of Ignorance, cannot be admitted in this caſe, it ſeems moſt congruous to reaſon, to referr all theſe Symptoms, to the evill affections of the brain, and nervous ſtock. For truly it may be plainly gathered, that the cauſe of the diſeaſe, did lye hid in the head it ſelf, by the Symptoms preceding the fit, which did denote a very great agitation of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, within the head; that inflation of the brain, and heavy ſwimmings, which conſtantly came juſt as the fit was coming upon him, the turnings of the eyes, manifeſtly argue, that heterogeneous and exploſive particles, did adhere to the ſpirits, dwelling within the <hi>Encephalon,</hi> near to the beginnings of the Nerves. So that this caſe, comes near to the nature of the Epilepſie, excepting, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits within the middle of the brain, did not admit an heterogeneous Copula, nor being exploſed in another place, did they tumultuouſly break forth there; for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the fit, the ſick perſon was ſtill in his ſenſes, or had the uſe of his memory: But the morbific matter, being more plentifully laid up in the head, when from thence it was ſlid, more deeply into the pipes, both of the Interior und Exterior Nerves, it had placed mines of exploſive ſeeds, very diffuſive, in the <hi>viſcera,</hi> both of the lower and middle belly, and alſo in the exterior members; ſo that, when the animal ſpirits began to be exploded, near the beginnings of the nerves, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently from thence, others inhabiting the meſenteric enfoldings, and then others in the other nervous enfoldings, interjected from the outmoſt bound, even to the head, being exploſed in order, did even continue the Convulſions, from one part to another, untill they came to the head it ſelf: but preſently the exploſion being tranſlated from thence, to the ſpirits dwelling in the ſpinal marrow, and Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Nerves, the moſt ſtrong Convulſions of the muſcles, and members of the whole body follow'd: But that, that aſcent, as it were of a bulk, or ſubſtance which very often was perceived in the lower belly, about the beginning of the Convulſions, proceeding from the ſpirits, within the meſenterick enfoldings, being brought into exploſions, ſhall be more largely declared anon, when we come to treat of hyſterick paſſions.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time if it be ask'd, for what reaſon, that, the convulſive paroxyſm, beginning in the part of the head, near the beginnings of the Nerves, preſently the ſpirits dwelling in the outmoſt parts (as many as are pre-diſpoſed for that Symptom) enter into exploſions, and ſo transfer the convulſive Diſtemper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there fully raiſed, upwards, (for it is for the moſt part ſo, whether the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the diſeaſe begins in the bottom of the belly, or about the middle of the abdomen, the <hi>Hypochondria</hi> or <hi>praecordia,</hi> for that the Convulſion is wont to creep by degrees,<note place="margin">Wherefore the Convulſions begin from the extremities of the Nerves.</note> from thoſe places towards the head.) I ſay, for the ſolution of this, theſe two conſiderations are offer'd, to wit, in the firſt place we conſider, that when ſome whole <hi>ſeries</hi> of ſpirits is diſturbed, thoſe who reſide in the extreameſt bounds are firſt deſtituted of their originall Influence; wherefore, they, before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, grow tumultuous, and begin to grow irregular; hence it is, when the Nerve of the arm or thigh, is ſtrained hard, by leaning on it, that the wonted Influence is hindred, that a numneſs, with a ſenſe of pricking or tingling, is firſt felt in the fingers or toes; from whence by degrees, it creeps upwards towards the places affected. Secondly, the other is, and rather the reaſon of this diſtemper, to wit, that the ſpirits being ready for exploſions, when they are contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:152521:233"/>
the nervous pipes, one or more, as ſo many diſtinct little Tubes, they require a ſufficient ample ſpace, in which they may be able very much, and indeed ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively to be rarefied, and expanded; which thing becauſe it cannot be eaſily performed, within the Trunks of the Nerves, from the beginning towards the end, therefore while the Spirits, about the nervous origine, being firſt ſtruck off, leap back towards the <hi>Encephaleon,</hi> for that cauſe they ſtir up the Vertigo: the more open exploſion of the ſpirits, for the moſt part, begins about the inferior paſſages of the nerves, or at their extremities, where the Trunk of the nerve is either dilated, into more ample foldings, or terminated in more <hi>fibres</hi> largely diſperſed abroad; then thoſe Spirits being exploſed, there is room made preſently for others ſucceeding in order, whereby in like manner they may be exploded: Hence we may obſerve, whilſt the exterior Spirits are exploded, if a Ligature or hard Compreſſion being made, the ſucceſſion of others into the ſame ſpace, or their progreſs toward the exterior parts be intercepted, the Convulſion is wont to be hindred, that it cannot aſcend upwards: wherefore when a numbneſs (as medical Hiſtories teſtifie) being ariſen from the fartheſt end of the finger, or toe, creeps to the ſuperior parts, with a tingling, or like a cold air, and at length reaching the brain, cauſes moſt horrid Convulſions; if by and by after the motion is begun, the Arm or thigh be ſtrongly tyed, the Spaſm or Convulſion not being able to get over the bound place, is hindred from coming to the head; yea, it is uſuall for hiſterical women, as ſoon as the ſwelling of the belly, or the aſcent of the bulk in the <hi>abdomen</hi> is firſt perceived, to gird ſtrongly their waiſts, with Swathing-bands, and ſo oftentimes they prevent, the <hi>Praecor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and the region of the brain, from being diſturbed, by that ſame Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Fit.</p>
                     <p>But that the Blood, being let out in the mideſt of the fit, was ſo ſoon congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, indeed it very ordinarily happens to be ſo, in Convulſive and Apoplectical Diſtempers, as the moſt learned <hi>Heighmore</hi> hath firſt noted, out of <hi>Hendochius:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Wherefore the blood is ſoon congealed in convulſive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.</note> But that ſome from hence contend, that Convulſions rely altogether upon the thickneſs of the Blood, and ſtagnation, its motion being hindred, cannot be granted: Becauſe, the blood taken from thoſe who are ſubject to convulſions, a little before the fit, is dilated with <hi>ſerum,</hi> and fluid enough: wherefore, we may lawfully think, that, that Congelation is cauſed by the <hi>paroxyſm</hi> it ſelf, becauſe in Convulſive motions, and immoderate Contractions of the Nerves, and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> the interflowing Blood, by the exhalations of its ſpirit, and <hi>ſerum,</hi> is ſomewhat looſened in its mixtion, and therefore in ſome ſort coagulated; like as when milk, by reaſon of too much agitation, and ſeparation of the parts one from another, grows into butter; wherefore this kinde of Coagulation of the Blood, ſeems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be the effect, than the Cauſe of the Convulſions.</p>

                     <p>SOmetimes Convulſive diſtempers do ariſe, without any fault in the Head, by the irritation and exploſion of the ſpirits, remaining about the extremities of the nerves, which plainly appears, becauſe, when medicines haul ſharply the Ventricles or Inteſtines, or worms gnaw them, there do not only follow Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

in thoſe parts, but beſides, convulſive motions do ſometimes torment (or are retorted on) the members, and outward Limbs: for indeed, as we have ſhown elſewhere, when the ſenſe of a very grievous Trouble torments any part, and from that is communicated to the chief Senſorie, preſently from thence, an involuntary, and irregular motion, is wont to be reflected on the ſpirits in that place irritated; and that not only by the ſame nerves, to which the ſenſe of the pain was carried, but ſometimes alſo the Convulſion is reciprocated, by others, either neighbouring, or altogether extraneous: So the Stone being fixed in the Ureters, and irritating very much its nervous <hi>fibres,</hi> excites Convulſive motions, not only in the diſtemperd Veſſell, but almoſt in all the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the Abdomen; So that, the urine being ſuppreſſed, Torments diffuſed here and there, and very often horrid Vomitings follow.

                     <p>Theſe kinde of fits, at firſt were wandring, and only occaſionally excited: to wit, they would come, as often as the pain of her breſt was ſtrained, by ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident cauſe: Afterwards, theſe Convulſions did more often infeſt her, and at laſt, they became habitual, and periodical, twice in a day, to wit, they were wont to come again conſtantly, at ſo many ſet hours after eating: And when after this manner, the ſick Gentlewoman, had been miſerably afflicted, for ſix months, at length, ſhe began to be moleſted with a vertiginous Diſtemper of her head, exerciſing her almoſt continually: for which evill, when a fomentation of aromatick and cephalick herbs, had been a good while adminiſtred to her head, ſhe became better, as to the giddineſs; but then ſhe was perpetually infeſted, with a quite new, and admirable Symptom, <hi>viz.</hi> an empty cough, without ſpitting, night and day, unleſs when ſhe was overwhelmed with ſleep: After this worthy Virgin, had tryed without much benifit, diverſe medicines and remedies, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by ſeveral Phyſitians, ſhe was at laſt helped, by making uſe of the moſt temperate Bath, at the <hi>Bath;</hi> then being preſently married, after ſhe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and was brought to bed, ſhe by degrees grew well.</p>
                     <p>If the reaſons of the whole diſeaſe and its Accidents, be inquired into,<note place="margin">The reaſon of this.</note> without doubt, the convulſive diſtemper, was firſt of all excited from the tumour, or pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned place of the breaſt; the cauſe of which was, partly the moſt ſharp ſenſe of pain, being impreſſed from its <hi>fibres</hi> and nervous parts, but partly by the hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous Copula, being affixed on the ſpirits inhabiting thoſe <hi>fibres</hi> and nerves; for truly, it may be ſuſpected, that the moſt ſharp humour impacted in the Tumor, which perhaps had in ſome ſort flowed thither, by the paſſages of the Nerves, being repercuſſed, by the uſe of Topicks, had entred the <hi>fibres</hi> and nervous fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or little ſtrings diſpoſed thorow the whole border or neighbourhood, and ſo the heterogeneous, and exploſive Copula, had clove to the ſpirits; for the ſhaking off of which, as often as by pain they were excited, they entred into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive exploſions, and together with them, other ſpirits flowing within the neighbouring Nerves, by conſent of the forms (as it often happens) were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded after the ſame manner: Then the convulſive diſtemper, when it firſt had begun in the extremities of the Nerves, being continued thorow their paſſages, even to the head, was wont to cauſe the inſenſibleneſs, and from thence, leaping back upon the whole <hi>nervous ſyſtem,</hi> the convulſive motions, of the Limbs and all the members: The fits, about the beginning of the ſickneſſe, being excited after this manner, by reaſon of pain, from the diſtemper'd part, were carried ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily to the brain, and its appendix: But afterwards, when the ſpirits inhabiting thoſe places, being often exploſed, by ſympathy, had ſo looſned, and weakned the pores of the containing parts, that there lay open a paſſage, within the ſame, for all heterogenious particles to enter, with the nervous juce, the convulſive <hi>procatarxis</hi> or more remote cauſe, alſo increaſed in the head; and the ſpirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting the <hi>Encephalon,</hi> being infected with an heterogenious Copula, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves begun the convulſive fit, or at leaſt afforded the firſt inſtinct to its aſſalt, which did return, for the moſt part, at ſuch ſet hours after eating, becauſe the morbific matter, was carried in, together with the nervous juce, almoſt in an equal dimenſion: In truth, in ſuch caſes, where the convulſion being generall, doth poſſeſs almoſt all the parts of the whole <hi>nervous ſyſtem</hi> ſucceſſively, we may ſuſpect, that the animal ſpirits, had contracted an heterogenious and exploſive Copula, in the whole nervous ſtock, which, when it is ariſen, at the ſet time, to a fullneſs, incites the ſpirits themſelves, at the appointed time, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

to believe, that the paſſions called hyſterical, do moſt often ariſe, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive matter, heaped up within the <hi>Meſenterick</hi> enfoldings, and by turns explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: which ſhall be more clearly manifeſted, where we treat eſpecially of thoſe diſeaſes: But, neither is it leſs probable, that the Collick-pains, do very often proceed, from a more ſharp and irritative matter, contained in the ſame enfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. Beſides, as often as the convulſive fits ſeem to begin from the ſpleen, or ventricle, by reaſon the beginnings of which are inflations, and very great diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances of thoſe parts, it is likely, that the neſt of the convulſive matter, was hid within the nervous enfoldings, belonging to the ſpleen or ventricle: Alſo, this kinde of matter, ſeems to excite within the Cardiac foldings, moſt heavy trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings, and paſſions of the heart; and within the pneumonic, or cervical, (or thoſe belonging to the Lungs and throat) enfoldings, moſt terrible fits of the Aſthma. In our Treatiſe of the Nerves, we have related a notable caſe, of a worthy Gentlewoman, to whom a ſerous matter, wonted to diſtill from the forepart of her head, through her left noſtrill, fell down behind her ear: where, when the moſt cruel pain did infeſt her, Convulſions alſo, and admirable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions followed: whereby the joynting or compaction, now of the brain, and the whole head, ſeem'd to be pulled downward, now the throat, <hi>praecordia,</hi> and <hi>Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera</hi> upwards: which kinde of Convulſions, vexing the parts ſo oppoſite, and at ſuch diſtance, by turns, when they did proceed from one and the ſame ſeat, of the diſeaſe, planted in the midſt, it will be obvious to conceive, that the grieved place, as the origine of either convulſive affection, was the ganglioform enfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, planted near the <hi>Parotidae,</hi> or the two chief <hi>Arteries</hi> of the throat: into which, the Nerves both of the wandring pair deſcending from the head are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and out of which the ſhoots do ſtretch themſelves, into the muſcles of the throat and branches, into the <hi>praecordia,</hi> and <hi>viſcera.</hi> Further, front the ſame cauſe, to wit, the convulſive matter, heaped up; and by turns exploſed, within the ganglioform enfoldings, we think, (and not undeſervedly) that ſenſe of

But truly, what theſe Authors ſay concerning the cure of this Diſtemper, and is practis'd commonly thorow the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is worthy of great admiration: for thoſe ſtung with a <hi>Tarantula,</hi> as very ſick as they are, as ſoon as they hear muſical Inſtruments, preſently they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of their pains, and leaping into the middle of the room, they begin to dance, and jump about, and ſo continue it, a long while, as if they were well, and ailed nothing: but if it happen, that the Fidlers leave off never ſo little a while, they ſtraitways fall to the ground, and return to their former pains, unleſs by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant muſick they dance, and leap, till the poyſon be wholly ſhaken off: For this end therefore, Muſitioners are hired, and are changed by turns, that without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the noiſe, thoſe who are bitten, may dance ſo long, till they are quite cured. Thus ſaith <hi>Mathiolus:</hi> to which <hi>Ferdinand</hi> adds, that poor people do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend almoſt all their ſubſtance, in theſe fidlers, and muſitians, who wander up and down all that Province; and by playing to theſe <hi>Tarantulaſized</hi> people, make much benifit: they dance or leap about, in the villages, and publick ſtreets, and fields, ſome one day, ſome one week, and others more. To theſe Authours, the moſt learned men <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> and <hi>Kircherus</hi> agree, both of which, have related it from their own obſervation, that they have known ſuch affected; and they aſſert, that they are not affected, or excited, indifferently with any muſick, but with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kinds of Tune, and that they dance to ſome meaſures, before others.</p>
                     <p>Let us inquire a little further, into the Reaſons of theſe aforeſaid Accidents,<note place="margin">The reaſon of the ſymptoms of thoſe bitten by a Tarantu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</note> if we may follow our conjecture, in this firſt place, 'tis without doubt, that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain venemous infection is fixed on the humane body, from the bite of this little creature, which tho it being leſs infeſtous to the blood, and vital ſpirit, as ſoon as ever it paſſes from it, into the nervous Liquor, it preſently unfolds it ſelf, thorow its whole maſs, like leaven, and infects the animal ſpirits, flowing every where in it; ſo that indeed, they being drawn one from another, and here and there inordinately moved, induce convulſive diſtempers, which are accompanied now with the contractures, now with the languiſhing, and reſolutions or looſning of the containing parts.</p>
                     <p>But why the painfull Convulſions, which are raiſed by the bite of the <hi>Tarantula,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In what the reaſon of the Muſicks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying the ſymptoms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.</note> being preſently allayed by muſick, are wont to turn into dancing, does not ſo plainly appear. That ſome affirm, this little animal (for that by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> it ſhould be moſt wiſe) to be delighted with muſick, and for that reaſon, its venom being impreſs'd on man, by fermenting the humours, to induce the like love of muſick: I ſay, this conjecture will not ſatisfie a minde deſirous of Truth, becauſe, that ſuppoſes a muſick-loving nature in the ſpider, and the ſame to be communicated to man, by a <hi>mataſtaſis,</hi> or as it were a certain <hi>metempſychoſis,</hi> or tranſmigration of ſoul, both which are taken upon truſt, and little ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but it may be rather ſaid, that the venome inflicted on the nervous liquor, by the bite of the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> is too gentle, to be able to extinguiſh wholly the Animal ſpirits, or to diſſipate them very much aſunder, and to compell them into more cruell exploſions, but only to put them to flight, and to incite thoſe flying here and there, into lighter, and ſomewhat painfull Convulſions; and that the Muſick, with its flattering ſweetneſſe, doth congregate together, and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aſſociate, with eaſe, the ſpirits ſo diſſipated: wherefore, when as the ſame ſpirits, by reaſon of the Infection ſticking to them, are apt to involuntary and Convulſive motions, the melody diſpoſes them, delighted together, and directs them to ſuch Convulſions, that entring the bodies of the nerves, by a certain Courſe, and Order, they are carried as it were in certain preſcribed limits and compaſſes, until at length the particles of the venome, being quite evaporated,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:152521:238"/>
and the fury and rage of the ſpirits being worn out, they wholly ſhake off that madneſſe. For truly, muſick doth eaſily carry men ſound and ſober, whether they will or no, or thinking of another thing, into actions anſwerable to the ſound of the harmony; that preſently the ſtanders by, at the firſt ſtriking up of the Fiddle, begin to move their hands and feet, and can ſcarce, nay are not able, to contain themſelves from dancing: Let none therefore wonder that in men bitten by the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> when the animal ſpirits being moved, as it were with goads, they are compelled to leap forth, and wander about hither and thither willingly, if they are excited to dancing, and compoſed meaſures, at the ſtroke of an harp; ſo that as in theſe diſtempers, the ſpirit of the muſick, as it were inchanting the outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirits, and in ſome meaſure governing, and changing their convulſive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſerves inſtead of an Antidote: for that the animal ſpirits, being very much, and for a long while exerciſed, after this manner, wholly ſhake off the Elaſtic <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula,</hi> contracted by the poyſon, or otherwiſe; and they being very much wearied, at length reſt from that madneſs, or its incitation.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>But indeed, it is ſometimes obſerv'd, that, beſides theſe kinde of Convulſive diſtempers, coming upon Feavours, and ſecondarily excited; in a malignant conſtitution of the air, alſo from the breath of a Peſtilent Contagion, the nervous Liquor hath been infected before the blood, or elſe apart from it, and therefore a <hi>Delirium,</hi> or Convulſions, have gone before a feavouriſh Diſtemper. Further, I have often obſerved, that ſome irregular Feavours have aroſe, in which the blood has been hardly ſeen to boyl up, or grow hot above meaſure, but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of this ſlow and very dangerous feavour, were layd chiefly in the nervous humour; which being by degrees brought to maturity, did induce Convulſive Diſtempers, with a <hi>Delirium,</hi> or madneſs, and other waſtings or exorbitances of the Animal Spirits. For the ſick never complained of heat, or thirſt, being

This kinde of ſickneſs, by ſome Phyſitians, becauſe it ſeem'd to conſiſt in the ſolid parts, rather than in the blood, is called a <hi>malignant hectick feavour;</hi> when indeed, the ſame being fixed chiefly in the nervous humour, may be better called, the <hi>Convulſive nervous Peſtilence.</hi>

Thoſe kinde of Contractions, and extentions, rendred themſelves by turns, and then changed places, that now the diſtemper reſided in one part, then preſently in another: But (as it often hapned) if the Diſeaſe, at once invaded the whole Brain, Univerſal Convulſions, and oftentimes epilepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Fits, infeſted the ſick: beſides, thoſe labouring with it, were obnoxious at ſome turns; to a <hi>Delirium, madneſs,</hi> and ſometimes a <hi>Lethargie:</hi> This ſickneſs, continued a long time, without any <hi>Criſis,</hi> or ſound ſolution, and could ſcarcely be ſo perfectly Cured, but that the Diſpoſition of the Brain, and nervous parts, remained evill all their Life after.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The reaſon of the ſymptoms.</note>As to the Reaſons of this Diſeaſe, and Symptoms, it is obvious enough, that the ſame depends altogether upon the vice, and notable depravation, of the nervous juce. That pricking, or tingling, for the moſt part, at the firſt coming of the diſeaſe, was procured for this Reaſon, becauſe that Liquor, beginning to be poyſoned, and looſned in its mixtion, by the malignant Infection, preſently it oppreſſed the animal Spirits, abounding therein, and inhibited them from their wonted, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

But that in this feavour of the nerves a ſolution or difficult <hi>Criſis,</hi> or none at all hapned, the reaſon was, becauſe the nervous juice being ſlow, and as it were mucilaginous, and therefore heavy in its motion, was not defaecated, or cleared, as the blood, by a critical efferveſcency, nor eaſily conceived, that kinde of fermentation, by which the pure, might be ſeparated from the impure.</p>

After the vernal <hi>aequinox,</hi> a certain irregular, and unaccuſtomed Feavour, ſeiſed upon ſome, here and there, which within a month, became ſo Epidemical, that in many places, it began to be called the <hi>New Diſeaſe;</hi> Raging chiefly among chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and youths; it was wont to afflict them, with a long, and as it were a Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Sickneſs: yea ſometimes, old men, and men of middle Age, though rarely, were ſeiſed by it, and thoſe indeed, it did ſooner, and more certainly kill.<note place="margin">The ſymptoms.</note> The Diſtemper at firſt invading any one, did creep on them ſo ſilently, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of the ſickneſs, were ſcarce perceived: for ariſing without immoderate heat, or more ſharp thirſt, it induced in the whole body a great debillity, with a languiſhing of the Spirits, and a torpitude or numbneſs of the function; The Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack was ready to loath any victuals, and to be grieved at any thing put into it, and yet not eaſie to vomit. The ſick were unfit for any motion, and only lov'd to be idle, or to ly down upon the Bed: within a ſhort time, alſo ſometime at the firſt coming of the Diſeaſe, they complained of a heavy <hi>vertigo,</hi> a tingling of the ears, and often of a great tumult and perturbation of the brain. Which kinde of Symptoms, were very often eſteemed, as it were the peculiar ſigne, of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of this Diſeaſe, if in ſome, thoſe had been wanting, or hapned to be more remiſs, inſtead of the head being affected after that manner, the diſeaſe took more deep root in the Breſt, with an excited cough, as ſhall be told by and by. But whilſt the brain, and the nervous <hi>Appendix,</hi> being after this manner affected, the animal Spirits, preſently from the beginning of the ſickneſs, were benummed, a ſlow and as it were hectick feavour, was inkindled throughout: but yet, the efferveſcency of the blood, which was hardly continual, but flitting, and uncertain, was according to the diſpoſition of the blood it ſelf, in ſome more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe, in others more remiſs; and therefore, thirſt, the white ſcurf of the Tongue, and other Symptoms, which accompany a feavouriſh diſtemper, did more or leſs infeſt them: ſweating did not willingly follow, nor could it eaſily, or by a light thing, be cauſed by Art: yea, neither this, nor any other evacuation, as it were critical, at any time ſucceeding, did ſuddenly help this diſeaſe; but it perſiſting for many weeks, and ſometimes months, reduced the ſick to the higheſt <hi>Atrophie,</hi> or waſting of all parts, and often infected them, with an incurable Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>About the increaſe of the diſeaſe, which hapned in moſt, within eight days, if the Diſtemper (as it was often wont) did ſettle chiefly in the head, and nervous Syſtem, moſt grievous Symtoms, in their Dominions, <hi>viz.</hi> a plain Phrenſie or deep ſtupidity or Inſenſibility did moleſt them. For I often obſerved, in many children, and not ſeldom in women, after ſeven or eight days from their falling ſick, that their knowledge and Speech failed them, and ſo the ſick have lain, for a long while, yea, ſometimes for the ſpace of a whole month, without any taking notice of the by-ſtanders, and with an involuntary flux of their excrements; but if they continued in ſome ſort the uſe of Judgment, and Reaſon, they laboured with a frequent <hi>delirium,</hi> and conſtantly with abſurd, and incongruous <hi>Chymera's,</hi> in their ſleep. But in Men, and others of a hotter temperament, from the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bific
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152521:240"/>
matter, inſtead of a <hi>Criſis</hi> being tranſlated to the brain, a Fury, or dangerous, and oftentimes deadly phrenſie did ſucceed. But if neither Stupidity, nor great Diſtraction did fall upon them, ſwimmings in the head, Convulſive motions, with Convulſions of the members, leapings up of the <hi>tendons,</hi> did grievouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt them. In almoſt all the ſick, the belly was for the moſt part looſe, caſting forth plentifully now yellow, now thin, and ſerous excrement, with a great ſtink: it was rarely that vomiting fell upon any one: The urine in the whole proceſs of the Diſeaſe, (unleſs when the morbifick matter, being caried more plentifully into the Brain, did threaten a phrenſie) was highly red, ſo that ſome, by reaſon of the deep colour of the water, judg'd this feavour to have been plainly Scorbutick: which notwithſtanding appeared to be otherwiſe, becauſe <hi>antiſcorbutic</hi> Remedies, (of which indeed many, and almoſt of every kinde were tryed) were little or nothing beneficial. It was moſt of all to be admired, how ſoon after the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Diſeaſe, the fleſh of the ſick conſumed, and they reduced to the lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a <hi>Sceleton,</hi> when in the mean time, there was no great heat, that might by degrees conſume the ſolid parts, nor any violent evacuation, which might greatly take them down.</p>
                        <p>Beſides theſe evills moleſting the region of the head, a diſtemper no leſs dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, oftentimes fell upon the breaſt. For in ſome, tho not in all, a cough very troubleſome, with abundance of ſpitle, and thick, was excited: this hapned in ſome, about the declination of the diſeaſe, to wit, whilſt the confines of the brain were ſerene, as it were the clowds ſent from thence to the thorax, a great <hi>Catarrh</hi> ſuddenly rained down upon the Lungs. But in others, who eſpecially had little infection of the diſeaſe in the head, preſently after the beginning of the feavour, a cruell cough, and a ſtinking ſpitting, with a conſumptive diſpoſition, grew upon them, and ſuddenly, and unthought of, precipitated the ſick into a <hi>Pthiſis:</hi> from which nevertheleſs, they recovered, by the timely uſe of Remedies, often beyond hope. It was obſerv'd in ſome, that after a long ecclips of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive facultie, and oppreſſion of the brain, from the morbific matter, at length tumors did follow, in the glandula's, neer the hinder part of the neck, out of which, being hardly ripened and broke, a thin and ſtinking ichor or matter, ran for a long time, and brought help. I have alſo ſeen watery puſtles, excited in other parts of the body, which paſs'd into hollow ulcers, and hardly curable: ſometimes little ſpots, and <hi>petechiales,</hi> appeared here and there: yet I never heard, that any more broad, or blew, of theſe kinde, were ſeen in the ſick. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, tho this feavour was not remarkable for very many malignant ſpots, yet it was not free from Contagion. For that in the ſame Family, it invaded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Children, and youths ſucceſſively, yea not rarely thoſe of more ripe years, and at mens eſtate, who looking to the ſick, were familiarly converſant in their Chambers, or about their beds, were infected with the ſame infection: But indeed, there was not ſo much cauſe of ſuſpition, that for it, the friends of the ſick ſhould be wholly interdicted, from commerce with, or viſiting of them.</p>
                        <p>Altho the courſe of this diſeaſe, (unleſs when it intimately ſettled in the brain) did appear ſo gentle, and continued without any horrid Symptome; yet its cure being always difficult, ſucceeded not under a long time: For the ſick rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grew well, within three or four weeks, yea for the moſt part, ſcarce in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny months. If this diſeaſe fell upon men of a broken Age, or ſtrength, eſpecially thoſe who were before obnoxious to <hi>cephalic</hi> diſtempers, as the <hi>Lethargie, Appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexie,</hi> or Convulſion, it oftentimes kill'd them in a ſhort ſpace: but if there was any hope of recovering, it could be but ſlowly procured, (all Remedies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſcarce bringing any ſenſible help) ſo that the ſick, did no ſooner come out of the ſphear of this diſeaſe, than they fell into the confines of a Conſumption.</p>

Further, foraſmuch as the ſame Liquor, was ſtuffed with heterogeneous particles; <hi>viz.</hi> partly narcotick, partly exploſive,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:152521:240"/>
therefore, a numbneſs, a ſenſe of pricking, leapings up of the tendons and muſcles, and contractures, alſo the <hi>Virtego,</hi> giddineſſe, and other more grievous Cephalick diſtempers did ariſe: Moreover, foraſmuch as by reaſon of the evil of the nervous juice, being not quickly or hardly to be mended, the cure or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the diſeaſe, became ſo hard, and lingring. But for that the fault of this <hi>Latex,</hi> neceſſarily depended on the diſcraſie or evill diſpoſition of the blood, alſo of the depraved conſtitution of the brain, what their morbid diſpoſitions were, and by what means they brought forth the beginning, or tinder of the Symptom of the feavour but now deſcribed, let us now ſee.</p>
                        <p>As to the former, it ſeems, that at this ſeaſon, by reaſon of the hot and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi'd conſtitution of the year, and no blaſt from the north (the little bodies of which imbue the blood, and juices of our body, as it were with a nitrous ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, and by agitating them, defend them againſt putrefaction) the blood in moſt men, and chiefly in children, youths, and women, became like ſtanding-water, that ſo contracts a ſetling, very impure, ſtuff't with heterogeneous parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and turning to a clammyneſs, and watriſhneſs; in which, the more pure ſpirit and ſulphur, being ſomewhat depreſs'd, the watery particles, being carried forth with the impure ſalt and ſulphur, were too much exalted. Wherefore the blood, both by reaſon of its <hi>Criſis</hi> or conſtitution, being vitiated, alſo by reaſon of heterogeneous particles, being heaped up more plentifully in its boſome, was made more fit, either of its own accord, or occaſionally, or becauſe of the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to receive a feavouriſh Efferveſcency, ſo that from thence, very many fell at this time into feavours. But the blood growing hot, from the feavouriſh taint being received, did not preſently burn with an open flame, but like green wood laid on the fire, with a flame as it were ſuppreſſed, and much incumbred with ſmoke. Wherefore, the morbific matter, being heaped within its maſs, was not wont, (as in a regular feavour) to be conſumed by the burning, and its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, at the ſet time, to be exterminated by the <hi>Criſis:</hi> but yet, a little after the beginning of the feavour, a great portion of this matter being powred into the head, at <hi>Thorax,</hi> or into both at once, and afterwards being continually ſupplied in thoſe parts, it induced either the aforeſaid diſtempers of the brain, and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſtock, or a cough, with a conſumptive diſpoſition, or both together, and for this reaſon, about the beginning of this diſeaſe, when a pulſe quicker than it ought to be, and a high colour'd urine, and full of contents, did ſhow the blood to grow hot with a feavouriſh diſtemper, the ſick did not complain of heat, or thirſt; becauſe the blood growing hot, did lay up its impurities, and recrements, forthwith into the proviſion of the nervous Liquor, or into the Lungs; wherefore, within theſe receptacles, the Symptoms preſently became worſe; but afterwards the diſeaſe growing on, a ſomewhat ſharp heat, with ſcurfneſs of the tongue, was wont to be troubleſome to ſome: yea, in all, a ſlow, and as it were hectick feavour, continued throughout; which neither by ſweat, nor by inſenſible tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, could be ſo wholly removed, but that it was daily renued, chiefly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eating, tho never ſo ſmall: which thing truly ſeem'd to happen, becauſe the nervous juice being full of the feculencies, brought from the blood, did not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards receive them in ſo great plenty, but that theſe recrements, together with the nutritious humour, (and for that this was not conſumed by nouriſhing the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid particles) remaining within the bloody maſs, cauſed it then to grow fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouriſhly hot.</p>
                        <p n="2">2ly, Beſides this morbid diſpoſition of the blood, contracted from the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the year, it ſeems, that the brain alſo, from the ſame occaſion, was made prone to the aforeſaid paſſions. For when, for a long tract of time, the ſouthern winds did continually blow, with a moiſt conſtitution of the Air; from thence, the paſſages, and pores of the brain, being very much looſned, and opened, and its connexion too much diſſolved, they gave an eaſie paſſage, to ſerous humours, and for all ſorts of heterogeneous particles: wherefore the blood being very fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent, and watery, as ſoon as it began to grow hot from the feavour, carried its ſerous recrements and filths, preſently thorow the too open doors into the head: for whoſoever he was, who did not complain of his head, being too much ſtuffed with a moiſt air, and numbneſs of ſpirits; on the contrary, his pores being bound together, by an intenſe cold, or dryer air, all his ſenſes, and faculties, remained more quick and lively.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The reaſon of the Atrophie coming upon this feavour.</note>Secondly, the noted <hi>Atrophie</hi> or leanneſs, came ſo ſuddenly upon this feavour, becauſe, by reaſon of the depravation of the nervous juice, the officies of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, depending upon it (which, as we have elſewhere ſhown, are highly active) preſently failed. For although we do not grant, the nervous humour to be only nutritious, but to diſpenſe thorow the Arteries, a matter deſtinated to the nouriſhable parts, prepared in the bloody maſs; yet it may be lawfull to think, that the Liquor watering the brain and nervous ſtock, by means of an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe, doth conduce very much to alimentation; for this growing turgid with animal ſpirit, actuates and invigorates the nutritious juice, brought to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part by the blood, and admitting it into the paſſages, and moſt intimate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles of the body to be nouriſhed, and as it were leading it in, aſſimilates or reſembles it, Wherefore, when this houſhold Liquor is ſo depraved, that it doth not rightly ſupply the animal ſpirits, requiſite about the work of nutrition, all the members and parts of the ſtomach vitiated in its tone, either ſpues back whatſoever nouriſhment is brought, or cannot receive it to its proper uſe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore truly in this diſeaſe, the bulk or habit of the body, however fuller or fatter, was more ſooner pull'd down, then in a continuall Feavour, where it might much more evaporate, by the intenſe heat, or copious ſweats. The reaſon of which is, becauſe in a burning feavour, altho the blood growing very hot, exhales more plentifully; yet in the mean time, it continually affords ſomething of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the ſeverall parts, help'd by the benefit of the nervous juice, eaſily received, and aſſimilated; but in this nervous peſtilence, altho the nutritive mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſufficiently provided, yet by the defect of the Nouriſhment of the ſpirits, the nouriſhment was altogether inhibited.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Why this fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was hardly curea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note>3. For the aforeſaid reaſons alſo, this feavour, being a long while protracted, was wont ſcarce ever to be critically helped, and difficulty cured, by the help of allmoſt any medicines: For the feavouriſh matter, creeping preſently, from the beginning of the diſeaſe, into the nervous Liquor, could hardly afterwards, and not but of a long time, be exterminated from its boſome: for that this water, with a ſlow motion, and flowing leaſurely in the ſtreight veſſells, does not as the blood, conceive of its own accord a purifying efferveſcency, or fermentation; neither can the forces of medicines, reach to it ſo eaſily, and unmixed: but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are firſt hindred by other parts, or becauſe they are heterogeneous, they are wholly excluded from the brain, caſting back whatever is incongruous. In truth for this reaſon, all diſtempers of the brain and nerves, as it were making a mock at Medicines, are moſt difficulty cured. Therefore in this feavour, if the evill impreſſed on the brain and nervous ſtock was taken away, either a cruell cough with plentifull ſpitting, ot tumours, or an Impoſtum in the neck did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: to wit, the morbifick matter being ſupped back, by the blood, and again depoſited, ſetled either in the <hi>Thorax,</hi> or in the Glandula's, and emunctories, nigh the hinder part of the neck. But this diſeaſe, was the more contumacious, becauſe the diſcraſie or evill conſtitution of the blood, was not eaſily mended: for altho from the beginning, its <hi>Latex,</hi> the recrements being poured forth, even into the nervous Liquor, grew but little and ſluggiſhly hot; yet afterwards, theſe receptacles being filled, and the morbific feculencies, and beſides the nutritious matter, not imployed in nouriſhing the parts, being reſident even in the blood, did aggravate it, and for the excluſion of this trouble, not to be mixed with it,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:152521:241"/>
did induce an Efferveſcency, ſuch as is wont to be in an hectick feavour, either almoſt continuall, or preſently apt to come again. For I have often obſerved in this feavour, from grewell, barly-broth, and other ſlender diet; no leſs ebuliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the blood to be ſtirred up, than from broth made of fleſh: whether indeed the nouriſhing juice, ſupplying the blood from the chyle, becauſe it was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the work of nutrition, carried ſomething heterogeneous, and not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſcible, as a trouble to the blood; and by reaſon of the particles of this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous juice, being copiouſly ſent away with the <hi>ſerum,</hi> the urine became very thick, red, and very full of contents: Alſo, for the ſame reaſon, the belly was for the moſt part looſe, foraſmuch as the blood, filled full of the nutritious juice, did ſuck forth a leſſer portion of the chile from the bowells, and did pour back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain part of that which had been brought to it, on the inteſtines; the feavouriſh diſtemper did likewiſe ſtick ſo long in the blood, becauſe, till the animal regiment being reſtored, nutrition was rightly performed, that ſuperfluous matter was carried into the maſs of blood.</p>
                        <p>We deliver the example, and the <hi>Aetiology</hi> or rational account of this aforeſaid feavour, more largely for this reaſon, becauſe the ſame diſeaſe, did fall upon our Countrey men, here and there alſo at other times: for that of late, in this City, all the younger people of a certain family, were ſick of it: yea, I remember, that ſome time paſt, very many laboured with ſuch a feavour; Out of the many hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and examples of ſick people, which it rendred when it was epidemical, I will here propoſe one or two.</p>

ſick, without any evident cauſe, without any great heat or thirſt, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſuddenly weak, and as if enervated, with a dejected appetite, and languor of ſpirits. <hi>Cathartick Remedies, Antipyretics</hi> or allaying of heat, digeſtives, and alſo antiſcorbuticks, and others of various kindes, adminiſtred by the preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the moſt famous Phyſitians, availed nothing: But notwithſtanding the ſick man, hitherto languiſhing with a ſlow and wandring feavour, with a quick and feeble pulſe, a deep-colour'd urine, had kept his bed a fortnight; beſides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduced to the greateſt leanneſs, he complained of a giddineſs, and as it were the fluctuation of a ſound in his head, and a tingling noyſe in his ears. Altho he was troubled with a great ſtupor, yet his ſleeps were mightily troubled, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with delirious fables. After four days, when the feavour was not yet decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it was thought good to take away four or five ounces of blood, by Leeches, from the ſedal veins; from hence the feavour began to be much exaſperated, for a great intenſe heat, with thirſt, watchings, and almoſt continual toſſing of the body, alſo the tongue dry, and ſcurfy, appeared; then quickly a troubleſome cough, with abundance of diſcoloured ſpittle followed, to him were adminiſtred, <hi>almond,</hi> and <hi>barly-drinks,</hi> with temperate bechicks (or things to ſtop coughing) boyled in them; water of milk diſtill'd with <hi>ſnails,</hi> and pectoral herbs, the ſhelly-powders, prepared nitre, and often Cordial opiats; which notwithſtanding ſcarce giving any help, the ſick man ſtill became more weak: when in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner being ſick above two months ſpace, the feavouriſh diſtemperature, and cough alſo, dayly growing worſe, he ſeemed near death, at length a voluntary ſweating ariſing, ſo that every night, or every other night, he ſweat abundantly, and from thence finding himſelf better, uſing then the aforeſaid Remedies, he grew well within ſix weeks.</p>
                        <p>Till I had ſeen many ſick people after the ſame manner, I ſuſpected this diſeaſe to be alltogether an hectick feavour, with a conſumptive diſpoſition of the Lungs; but when I ſaw many others at that time fall ſick ordinarily, after the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I eaſily inſtituted the <hi>Aetiologie</hi> or national account of this feavour, ſuch as I have already deſcribed: to wit, that the blood, becauſe of the intemperature of the year, and perhaps from errors in dyet,<note place="margin">The reaſon of it.</note> had contracted a vitious <hi>procatarxis</hi> or remote cauſe: Then it growing feavouriſhly hot, and preſently carrying its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities to the brain, and ſo depraving the juice, watering it, and the nervous ſtock, induced the vertiginous diſtempers, with a <hi>ſtupor,</hi> a languiſhing of ſpirits, and an <hi>atrophy</hi> of the whole body: but ſo long as the blood did transfer its recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from its own boſom, into the brain and nervous <hi>appendix,</hi> the feavouriſh heat continued more gentle and milde: But afterwards, when the tending down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the morbific matter, by the opening of the hemorhoid veins, was drawn

away from the brain, the ſame being firſt retained within the bloody maſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the feavour; then being poured on the Lungs, excited the cruel cough; with plentifull ſpittle: but foraſmuch as the fleſh of the Lungs remained free from putrefaction, as ſoon as the ſerous water was ſent away by a more plentifull ſweating, the ſick man became free, both from the feavour, and <hi>phthiſis</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, that ſeemed ſo deplorable.</p>

                        <p>We found a no leſs clear track, of this ſo deadly diſeaſe in the head: for the ſhell of the skull being removed, preſently the veſſells, creeping thorow the <hi>meningae,</hi> were ſeen to ſwell very much with blood, as if almoſt the whole maſs of blood, were gathered together in the head: for the veins being cut or broken, about the Inwards of the lower and middle belly, little blood flowed forth: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, thoſe membranes where they cloath the <hi>Cerebel,</hi> and being higher ſpread divide it from the brain, being ſprinkled in very many places with extravaſated blood, were noted to be of a black-purple colour; that it was not to be doubted, but the <hi>Phlegoſis</hi> or Inflamation round about excited, was the cauſe of the ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly infeſting Convulſions.

heaped together, in its maſs to a fullneſs; that from thence a flowring or putting forth ariſing, at the ſet intervalls of times, it might thruſt the ſame ſubtilities out of doors: yea rather this growing hot glows not with a great, and open bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: but like a fire covered over with chips, ſends forth a moiſt ſmoke or breath, rather then a flame: But ſo, that from thence, by reaſon of the nervous juice being depraved ſoon in its diſpoſition, and not rarely, becauſe of the lungs being ſtuffed with the conſumptive matter, the convulſive, or phthiſical or conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſymptoms, did moleſt chiefly, in the whole courſe of the diſeaſe.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Blood to be taken away at the beginning of the diſeaſe.</note>It behoves us to deſigne the curative Intentions, according to the various times of the diſeaſe, and the diverſities of the ſymptoms chiefly urging. About the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this feavour, the taking away of blood, ſeem'd convenient allmoſt to all: This kinde of remedy, I often experienced with ſucceſs, in little Children: For that by the means, as it were another breathing place is opened, to the maſs of blood, ſilently and covertly growing hot, and obtruding its ſoot or ſmoak, on the more noble parts; and for that reaſon, its impure effloreſcencies or puttings forth, are drawn away from the brain, and lungs. Therefore, although this fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of an ill Condition, may be accounted as it were malignant, yet foraſmuch as the blood is not preſently apt to be coagulated, but to be too much poured forth, and to beſtow its ſeroſities on the nobler parts, to wit, the brain and lungs; therefore <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> ſo it be adminiſtred in the beginning of the diſeaſe, is convenient allmoſt to all.</p>
                        <p>For the ſame reaſon, <hi>Cathartick</hi> Medicines, and chiefly vomitory, are admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred at the very beginning of the diſeaſe; for theſe do not only evacuate the <hi>viſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> of concoction, and ſo draw away the chief fomenting of the diſeaſe, and as it were its originall, but beſides, they draw forth the ſeroſities from the blood, and ſo effect its cleanſing, rather in the ſtomach and Inteſtines, then in the head and lungs. Further by Emeticks, for that the receiving <hi>Glandulaes</hi> of the <hi>Lymphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts,</hi> are pulled with a great ſhaking, the ſuperfluities of the nervous juice, leaſt they ſhould evilly affect the brain, and its dependencies, are expreſſed forth into the lower bowells: alſo for this end, the belly is to be kept continually looſe, by the uſe of Clyſters. But in the mean time, whilſt the blood being infected with the taint of this diſeaſe, threatens the brain or <hi>praecordia,</hi> with the evill, it will not be ſafe to attempt any thing with <hi>Diaphoreticks,</hi> or ſweating medicines, or <hi>Diureticks</hi> or ſuch as evacuate by urine, or alſo with <hi>Catharticks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> vomiting and purging medicines: For theſe kinde of medicines, foraſmuch as they greatly pour out the blood, and compell its ſeroſities into more open iſſuings forth, all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, being apt to fall away from the maſs of the blood, are eaſily obtruded on the brain, or Lungs, when they are of a more feeble conſtitution: So in the youth above-mentioned, a loſs of ſpeech, came upon the raiſing of an untimely ſweat: Alſo I have known, that <hi>Sudorificks,</hi> no other then chaly beats, in the morbid diſpoſition of the lungs, have brought on a waiſting or Conſumption.</p>

without poyſon or feavouriſh infection, by reaſon of the ſcorbutick, or otherwiſe vitious dyſcraſie or evill diſpoſition, of the nervots juice. For indeed, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor watering both the nerves, and the nervous parts, ſometimes diſceding from its naturall diſpoſition, is ſo much ſtuff'd with heterogeneous and exploſive par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, that the animal ſpirits, admitting an incongruous <hi>Copula,</hi> every where growing to themſelves, are irritated into continuall, as it were cracklings, or convulſive exploſions: Theſe kinde of Affections of the ſpirits,<note place="margin">Two kindes of theſe <hi>viz.</hi> Separate and Connex or joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> are either divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or ſeparated, between which no Communication, or dependency intercedes, <hi>viz.</hi> When many parts of the body are troubled at once, with ſo many Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions proper to themſelves, which do not come ſucceſſively one from another, but are terminated in the ſame muſcle or member, where they begin: After which manner, I have known ſome ſick people, who have had their muſcles and tendons, all at once in their whole body, perpetually to leap forth, with ſo many diſtinct Convulſions. Or Secondly, the Convulſive Diſtempers, which are excited in the whole nervous kinde together, are continued or connex, which ſucceed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with a certain perpetual viciſſitude continued between themſelves: Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as inordinate motions, almoſt of all the members, mutually relieving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, being riſen in one part, preſently paſſe over to others. For ſo <hi>Horſtius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of a maid, obnoxious to Convulſive motions, whoſe members and Limbs not only were forced into divers manner of flections and diſtortions, but beſides, as if agitated by an evill Spirit, not being able to ſtand in a place, ſhe was neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to run up and down here and there, and to dance, and leap in the Hot-houſe; nor could be hindred from it by any force or chiding, but that ſhe would run here and there; now ſhe would caſt her ſelf on her feet, now impetuouſly fling her ſelf after another manner, for if ſhe did endeavour never ſo little to be quiet, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly her <hi>Praecordia</hi> was moſt grievouſly afflicted. Wherefore, the Buſineſs of our preſent task is, to enquire a little more exactly, into the nature and Cauſes of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Convulſive Affection, to wit, both of that, which is affected through the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much leaping of the tendons and muſcles together, and of this, which is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the madneſs and inquietudes of the members or of the whole body: that from thence it may appear, what method of healing ought to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in either Caſe.</p>
                     <p>As to the former kinde, it eaſily appears, that theſe kinde of diſtempers,<note place="margin">The nature of the broken Convulſive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</note> are not ſimple, but complicated, to wit, of a Convulſion, and Palſie. For the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and tendons, are perpetually urged with Convulſive motions, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſick being made weak, they are not able ſtrongly to move any of their members, or their whole body: yea, to theſe Diſtempers, pains equally diffuſed thorow all the Limbs, are adjoyned. Hence we may infer, that the animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are imbued, with a manifold <hi>Copula, viz.</hi> both with exploſive, and alſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotick ot ſtupifying, and in ſome ſort irritative or provoking particles: ſo that, although being alway burthened, they enter into exploſions, yet, not many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, nor indeed any haſtily or ſtrongly are exploded, by reaſon of the other interjected Particles of another kinde; wherefore the motive force does not long continue, but is ſhort, and as it were interrupted: juſt as if gunpowder being kneeded with ſome muddy ſubſtance, ſhould be fired: for then the whole maſs is not let off at once, with a noiſe, nor does one heap preſently fire another, but a few grains only, and thoſe ſucceſſively, to wit, one a little while after another, with ſmall crackling noiſes, are let off or exploded: In like manner, the nervous Liquor is ſtuffed thorowout, with Convulſive particles, which even cleave to the Spirits: but foraſmuch, as ſome narcotick, and other painfull ones, are mingled with them, the elaſtick force of the former, however laſting, and greatly diffuſed, is yet much broken and every where cut off.</p>
                     <p>For the illuſtrating this kinde of broken convulſive Diſtemper,<note place="margin">An obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> I will here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a very notable caſe of a certain Gentleman lately living in this neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: which being truly admirable, not any writings or obſervations of Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, have ſcarce ſhewed the like. An honourable Gentleman whom I knew, ſprung from Parents, and grandfathers obnoxious to a ſomeways morbid diſpoſition ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Brain, or nerves, about the hight or beyond the ſtrength of his Age, the fruit of this diſeaſed Race began to puniſh him: for firſt of all, he was wont to be tormented with a debility, and numbneſs of his Limbs, and with light Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions; with which kinde of Diſtempers, when he had a while laboured at length,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:152521:245"/>
for cure ſake going to the Bath, having uſed too much the hot bathes, inſtead of a remedy, he brought back only an exaſperation of the Diſeaſe, that from that time, the aforeſaid Symptoms did not any more torment him by fits, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt continually, to wit, the Convulſive motions, and painfull extenſions, did inceſſantly exerciſe every Limb, yea, every part of his Body, ſo that all the muſcles were perpetually drawn together, with repeated leapings all at once, and that not without great torment: The only means he had for quieting them, was to exerciſe his whole body, ſometimes ſome of his members, perpetually with a local motion: for ſo long as he was awake, he was neceſſitated to be rock'd in his bed, or on his couch, or to be carried in a Coach, or to have his members preſs't or rubb'd; for which end they had made for him a Bed, and a Chair ſet upon bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhon'd feet, ſuch as are on Childrens Cradles, in which, when he lay down or ſat upright, he was moved up and down continually, with a tottering or rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing motion; which unleſs he did, he was infeſted with moſt cruel pain, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid extenſions of his muſcles: This kinde of dayly trouble, of the Convulſive Diſtemper, in the night-time, and preſently after ſleep; entertain'd much more grievous Symptoms: for being newly awaked, his whole body preſently was wont to quake, his muſcles to be exerciſed with painfull ſtretchings, every Limb to be wetted with a ſqualid or ill-favour'd ſweat, as if in the agony of Death, which was ſo very Corroſive, that, like <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> unleſs they preſently wiped it off, it quickly eat and rotted the Linnen. The ſick man, during this Conflict, was tormented for many hours, between the ſweats and ſhiverings, untill being quite tired out, ſleep creeping upon him, brought him ſome eaſe; but if at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the fit, he was preſently taken out of his Bed, he was better, and ſo prevented the wonted cruelty of the Diſtemper: Therefore, as ſoon as he was awaked from ſleep, though it hapned within half an hour, immediatly to avoyd the torture, his ſervants being called, they took him out of his Bed: As to his Appetite he was well enough, he eat without loathing, nor was his ſtomack diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb'd with what he eat: Bur he did often complain of the pain of the heart, and ſometimes a troubleſome Spitting, with a ſtink in his mouth, as if he had taken <hi>Mercury,</hi> moleſted him for many days. All hot things, whether food or Phyſick, did nor agree with his conſtitution; he did not dare to taſte, either wine, or ſtrong beer: In the firſt years of his ſickneſs, he abhor'd the very ſight of the fire, afterwards becoming weaker; though the winter was ſharp he would not ſit neer the Chimny; his Urine was always of a Citron colour, which if it were evaporated in an earthen veſſell, over hot coals, ſaltiſh faeculencies remained in the bottom, to above half the Liquor; his belly was continually bound, and never put forth its load, unleſs provoked by a purge or Clyſter: Yea, beſides the Convulſive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a Spurious Palſie poſſeſſed every member of his whole Body, for he could not lift up his hand, nor ſtep a foot forward; his tongue ſhaking, brought forth his words but imperfect, but ſometimes, when his minde was carried ſorth, by ſome ſudden occaſion of Joy, he would be able, his Spirits being raiſed with a wonderfull ſtrength, ſuddenly to riſe out of his chair, and without the help of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, to ſtand upright, and to jump, which interval however laſted ſcarce a minute of an hour, but that his members flagg'd, and were affected with their wonted languor and trembling. When this worthy Gentleman, had been ſick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner above 12. years, and had conſulted the moſt famous Phyſitians in all <hi>England,</hi> and had tryed very many Remedies, and almoſt of every kinde, <hi>viz.</hi> Antiparalytick, antiſcorbutick, drying Diets, Sweating medicines, purges, Cauſticks, baths, Liniments, yea, and had twice tryed ſalivation, could finde no cure by any method of healing; wherefore, all hope of cure being wholly layd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, for the latter ſeven years of his life, he made uſe of only Remedies, chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting ſome Symptoms, <hi>viz.</hi> he took thrice in a week a ſolutive medicine, of <hi>Senna</hi> and <hi>Rubarb</hi> with Correctives, now in form of a Syrrop, or of an extract a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time; every night he was wont to take a doſe of an opiate, out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, and temperate <hi>Species:</hi> Beſides, as occaſions ſerv'd, he had ready a Julap, to be taken when his Spirits fainted: moreover, he continually drunk Beer, made of oaten mault, altered with temperate and diuretical herbs. By the uſe of theſe, he paſs'd over at leaſt ſeven years, without any great alteration for the worſe; at length, old Age coming on him, together with the diſeaſe, more cruel fits of Convulſions, not as at firſt after ſleep, but aſſoon as he was warm in his bed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:152521:245"/>
him, that he was forced to abſtain altogether from his Bed, and rarely put off his cloaths, unleſs to ſhift his Linnen: from hence tranſpiration being hindred, the ſerous Recrements, and others; wont to be evaporated, were fixed on the Lungs, which at firſt, brought in a frequenr or ſhort breathing, afterwards an Aſthmatical Diſtemper, and laſtly a deadly Conſumption or waſting.</p>
                     <p>If the Reaſons of the aforeſaid Symptoms be ſought after, it will be eaſie,<note place="margin">The reaſons of the ſymptoms chiefly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting.</note> to deduce all theſe evills from a depraved Conſtitution of the Brain, and nervous ſtock, and more immediatly from the dyſcraſie, and fault, of the juice watering thoſe parts. For when that Liquor, in which the animal Spirits, do abound, was, as to its temper, highly ſharp and Corroſive, like <hi>Stygian</hi> water, and as to its mixion, was fluffed full of both narcotick and exploſive particles, it is no wonder, becauſe the Spirits being very much burthened, and for that cauſe reſtrained from their due expanſion, that they ſhould be forced every where into ſmall exploſions, as it were Cracklings; and that the containing bodies, being looſed from their due extenſion and ſtrength, ſhould be alſo continually irritated into painfull Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugations or ſhrinkings up.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Convulſive Diſtempers, did more ſharply infeſt after ſleep,<note place="margin">The growing worſe preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after ſleep whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</note> becauſe the heat of the Bed, did exuſcitate or ſtir up the heterogeneous particles of the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous juce, and rarifying them, as it were compell'd them into exploſions; then alſo, becauſe the nervous parts did imbibe its juce in ſleep, and a more plentifull proviſion of the morbifick matter, brought together with it; which being filled to a plentitude, at the firſt inſtant of waking, they immediatly endeavour to ſhake off what is troubleſome. For this Reaſon, it is obſerved, that the pains of Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical people, and the fits of Aſthmatical, are made worſe by the heat of the bed, and by ſleep; therefore as in theſe, preſently to leave the bed, was wont to give eaſe, ſo likewiſe it did in our ſick man: But that the trouble,<note place="margin">Why allayed by Motion.</note> excited by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual leapings, and painfull extentions of the muſcles, was ſomewhat allayed by the local motion, or moving from one place to another, of the body, or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the reaſon is, becauſe the Animal Spirits, whilſt they are compelled to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers actions from without; they remit whatſoever inordinations are excited from within: for as in pain, and itching, which are lighter Convulſions, it helps to preſs, rub, or ſcratch the affected part, ſo the Convulſive motions of the muſcles, and tendons, are ſomewhat pleaſed, by the inordinate agitation of the whole body, or the members.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Ptyaliſmus,</hi> or copious ſpitting, with the ſtinking breath,<note place="margin">The ſpitting.</note> which was wont to return at uncertain intervalls, we do ſuppoſe, that might perchance proceed from <hi>Mercury</hi> ſometime ſecretly given, although I have ſeen many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring both with Convulſive, and alſo ſcorbutick diſtempers, in whom this kinde of perpetual defluxion of ſpittle from the mouth, was very troubleſome, without any ſuſpition of <hi>Mercury;</hi> alſo ſome (as ſhall be told hereafter) on whom a ſalivation coming (the exploſive matter being after this manner Critically e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuated) help'd the diſeaſe: moreover, it is likely, that this diſtemper was produced from the mere recrements of the nervous juice; and that the ſalival paſſages, when many, and enough were open, did receive, and convey forth of doors, the ſuperfluities plentifully depoſited in the <hi>glandula's,</hi> from the nerves, and alſo from the Arteries.</p>
                     <p>As to the lucid Intervalls, whereby the ſick man us'd to obtain ſome truces,<note place="margin">Why this ſick man obtained ſome truce from pains.</note> though ſhort, the cruelties as it were of the diſeaſe being mitigated, as when but now his ſickneſs had bound him to his chair, he was able on a ſudden to leap up, and walk about; but yet, this unlook'd-for ſtrength being vaniſh'd, by and by falling again into his wonted languiſhment: I ſay theſe kinde of motions of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nature, proſtrate under a great burthen, are its utmoſt endeavours, and ſome more ſtrong inforcements, to wit, whereby for a moment of time ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collects her ſelf, and attempts as it were to ſhake off the yoak of the Diſeaſe; but becauſe ſhe is not able to ſuſtain long this ſtrife, ſhe quickly relapſes, and lies down under her former burthen. Truly it is a wonder, how much above the ſtrength of Nature, Anger, and fear, and ſome other paſſions of the minde, do ſtretch the nervous kinde, and compell them to ſhew a force plainly ſtupendious: But theſe prodigies of her attempts, are only of a ſmall duration.<note place="margin">The ſecret lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cauſe of the aforeſaid diſtemper.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Conjunct cauſe of the aforeſaid diſeaſe being after this manner deſigned, and the Reaſons of the Symptoms chiefly tormenting, being ſhown, it remains
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:152521:246"/>
yet for us to inquire into the ſecret leading cauſe, to wit, by what occaſions, the nervous juice being become ſo degenerate, at firſt brings in the Palſie, and then leapings, or inteſtine Convulſions of all the muſcles: further, we ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain wherefore the fruits of this Diſeaſe, increaſing by little and little, came ſuddenly to maturity, by the uſe of the Baths; alſo wherefore this ſickneſs yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to no Remedies became uncurable.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt, it may be ſaid, that the ſick perſon, being ſprung from parents who were obnoxious greatly to Cephallic Diſeaſes, had contracted originally an evill Conſtitution of the brain, and nervous ſtock, ſo that within the 6th luſtre (<hi>i.e.</hi> about the 36th year) of his Age, he began to be ſick of a ſpurious Palſie, then, when the evident cauſes daily fixing the infection more on the bloud and humours, did happen upon this remote hereditary cauſe (for there were many chances, and unfortunate accidents, which continually brought ſadneſs, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly upon this Gentleman) indeed therefore, the nervous Liquor being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued above meaſure, with a fixed and Scorbutic ſalt, became highly ſharp and irritative, like <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> or the Stagma's of <hi>Vitriol;</hi> and ſo continually incited the Spirits, and the bodys containing them, into Corrugations and contractions, juſt as the aforeſaid Liquors when poured upon worms do the ſame thing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Why this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper grew worſe by the uſe of the Baths.</note>But that this diſeaſe, leaſurly at firſt increaſing, was quickly brought into a much worſe condition, by the uſe of the hot Bathes, the reaſon eaſily appears: It is known by experience, that the hot Bathes, do very much exalt, and quickly bring to the hight, the Sulphureous-ſaline particles, in the humane body, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe morbid, which abound in the Bowells, and humours, <hi>viz.</hi> do render them more fierce by agitating them throughly, and force them from their firſt paſſages into the blood, and from thence into the Brain and nervous ſtock, yea, and joyn together thoſe, that were before ſeperate, and idle, and incite them into a certain fermentation: wherefore, thoſe who are hereditarily obnoxious to the <hi>Gout</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> and have not as yet ſuffer'd any fits of thoſe diſtempers, very often feel the fruit of either diſeaſe in themſelves to grow ripe ſoon, by the uſe of the Bathes: When therefore in this ſick perſon, both the blood, and Liquor water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Brain and nerves, were imbued both with narcotick or ſtupifying, and convulſive particles; and alſo when they did degenerate from their ſweet, and balſamy Diſpoſition, that towards a ſaltiſh, and this into a ſour, <hi>Ciaemul</hi> of a <hi>Stagma</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> the uſe of the hot minerall waters, was ſo far from bringing help, that on the contrary, theſe evills, for that very cauſe, preſently grew all very much worſe: and the Diſeaſe, proceeding from the humors being ſo depraved, as to their temper and mixture, could never be cured by any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, no eaſier than vinegar may be reduced into wine.</p>
                     <p>When this Gentlemans body, being at laſt dead of the <hi>Phthiſis</hi> or <hi>Conſumption,</hi> was opened by me, we could finde but very few foot-ſteps, of theſe kinde of moſt grievous Symptoms. Hence, as it appear'd, the <hi>Palſie</hi> and <hi>Convulſion,</hi> did not depend, ſo much on a thick and copious matter, heaped together ſomewhere in mines, as of an evill affection of the animal Spirits, who are ſubtle and Inviſible. I will lay forth, what was worthy taking notice of, in the anatomy of this perſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Things worthy to be noted in the body being diſſected.</note>The <hi>Abdomen</hi> being opened, the <hi>Caule</hi> (as is wont to be in moſt who dye of a Conſumption, and other Chronical Diſeaſes) was putrified, and almoſt conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. In the mean time, the <hi>Ventricle, Inteſtines, Pancreas,</hi> and <hi>Meſentery,</hi> were well enough, to wit, the membranes were firm, well coulour'd, and free from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ulcer, or hard ſwelling: There grew to the greater Inteſtines certain excreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies like to the ears of a mouſe; for that there were very many of theſe kinde of things out of either ſide of the <hi>Colon,</hi> and right inteſtine, they ſhewed like twins at certain diſtances, like the branches of Trees: The like I formerly found in a Conſumptive perſon: The Reaſon of this ſeems to be, that the nouriſhment in Conſumptive people, (though it be deficient about the more ſolid, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, yet ſometimes) within neer the fountains of the nouriſhing juice, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms more than it ought, and for that cauſe, ſuperfluous and unnaturall additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons grow forth.</p>
                     <p>The milt or Spleen, which always is thought ill of, and of moſt Phyſitians condemned, for being the Principal cauſe of the Scurvy, and of all other diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, appear altogether blameleſs, and free from any fault: For, as in moſt ſound

people, we obſerved, it was of a darkiſh Colour, ſoft and of an equal <hi>ſuperficies,</hi> free from any obſtruction, or ſwelling, indued with veſſells, and <hi>fibres,</hi> diſtinct, and firm enough: out of its ſubſtance, flowed black biood when it was cut.</p>
                     <p>The Liver (which indeed might be wondred at) was indifferently well, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it, from ſo long and grievous a ſickneſs, become harder then uſuall, or ſcirrhous, or planted with little whelks, but it was ſomewhat big, and of a darkiſh colour.</p>
                     <p>The Kidnys, though free from any ulcer, or gravell, were not however free from fault: for in the middle of the right Kidney, was ſeen a great cavity, diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inct from the Tunell, and much greater then it, full of clear water: the like I have very often found, in hydropical people: But indeed, this perhaps aroſe, from the <hi>ſerum</hi> depoſited in that kidny, that could not eaſily be ſtrained thorow its paſſages, and pores; for that the <hi>ſerum</hi> ſubſiſting therein, had in the beginning made for it ſelf a little den, which afterwards by degres was inlarged, and when for this Reaſon, the ſecretion of the <hi>ſerum,</hi> and its paſſing forth by the <hi>ureter,</hi> were ſomething hindred, its <hi>Latex</hi> reſtagnating into the blood, brought in the grievous trouble to the head; which indeed was the rather to be ſuſpected, becauſe alſo the left Kidny, being mightily extenuated, and conſumed, contained many Ciſterns, and Cavities full of clear water.</p>
                     <p>The Lungs, growing on every ſide to the <hi>Sternum,</hi> (or part of the breaſt where the ribs meet) ſides, and <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> ſeem'd without any diſtinction of <hi>Lobes,</hi> of one ſubſtance only of putrid ſpongy fleſh, ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In either ventricle of the heart, blood was concreted into a ſolid whitiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and bak'd like fleſh, which being formed neer the Cavities, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the veſſells of the Heart, reſembled the figure of a Serpent, with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold divided tail: than which indeed nothing is more uſual, in many dead Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple after long ſickneſs: The reaſon of which is, that the Blood being without life, from long ſickneſs, and from thence circulated ſlowly about the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> begins to ſtand or ſtagnate in the heart, and depending veſſells, and by that means, is congealed leaſurely, into this kinde of fleſhy Concrete.</p>
                     <p>When the Skull was opened, we ſought among its contents, the chief Cauſe of the Diſeaſe: The firſt thing that occurr'd was, the bulk of the brain was leſs than it ſhould be, and folded into fewer folds, from whence we ſuſpected, that the Animal Spirits, were not plentifully enough brought forth: Further, the whole ſubſtance of the head, was more moiſt than it ought to be, and wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed in a wet watery humour, that its Covering, <hi>viz.</hi> the whole meninges, were pulled aſunder, and the compaſſing or crevices, and all the ventricles, run over with clear water. 'Tis probable, that this deluge of the Brain, had lately hapned, to wit, foraſmuch, as by reaſon perſpiration being hindred, and the Secretion of urine being but little, the ſeroſities gathered together in the bloody maſs, were carried to the head, and therefore, the ſubſtance of the Brain, and eſpecially the chancelled or chequer'd bodies, were ſo wholly wetted, and ſoked, that being cut, their ſubſtance could ſcarce remain compacted, but that it would flow away, ſomewhat after the manner of thick Liquids: within the boſoms o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlying, and inſerted to the brain, and its <hi>Appendix,</hi> and the veſſells coming from them, the blood had concreted into little, round, hard, and as it were fleſhy balls, juſt like thoſe within the ventricles of the heart, and the veſſells hanging to them, which alſo lately, when the Bloud circulated ſlowly, we thought might happen, for the ſame reaſon, for which the blood was coagulated within the <hi>Praecordia.</hi>

                     <p>When I was ſent for to this Gentlewoman, on the Sixth day of her ſickneſs, I framed the Aetiology of this kinde of admirable diſtemper: For the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her father, who at that time was ſick in the ſame houſe, with moſt grievous Convulſive paſſions, kept me, that I did not with many others, refer all things to the deluſions of witches: wherefore, that I might ſeek out the natural Cauſes of theſe Symptoms, it was in the firſt place plainly to be ſuſpected, that this
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:152521:247"/>
Gentlewoman had contracted hereditarily the ſeeds of Convulſive Diſtempers, which at length, about the flower of her age, broke forth into this kinde of fruit: for when her blood was very much imbued with heterogeneous and explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive particles, they at length (as is wont in ſuch a diſpoſition) began to be poured into the head, and there to be fixed: being therefore firſt depoſited in the <hi>Meningae,</hi> they induced the huge periodicall head-ach; then afterwards, the ſame matter having accidentally ſhifted its place, falling down into the ſinks of the throat and mouth, changed the <hi>Cephalage</hi> or head-ach, into a <hi>Catarrh</hi> or <hi>Rhume:</hi> and when laſtly by an untimely uſe of the adminiſtred Remedy, the defluxion ſtop'd, the morbifick matter flowing back into the brain, brought the <hi>Vertigo;</hi> and then, being thruſt forth on the nervous ſtock, it excited the aforeſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive Affections.</p>
                     <p>As to the formal Reaſon, or the means of generation,<note place="margin">The reaſon of the aforeſaid caſe.</note> whereby the Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive matter, falling down into the nervous ſtock; did produce theſe admirable Symptomes, we may lawfully ſuppoſe, that the ſame being thruſt forth from the Confines of the head, being yet more firm, into the ſpinal marrow, and its <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix;</hi> and being like a malignant firment, it firſt infected, with heterogeneous and highly exploſive particles, theſe parts of the juce watering the whole maſs; which cleaving to the ſpirits, every where diſpoſed thorow their whole <hi>ſeries,</hi> and agitating them, as it were with a certain fury, did ſtir them up into continuall exploſions: When in truth, the nervous juice, as is ſaid, was ſo fermented by the inflowing of the Convulſive matter, that which did other ways water the contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts, with a gentle falling on them, and through the ſame; did paſs over the animal ſpirits; with an equal Expanſion; now the ſame did torment the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous <hi>fibres,</hi> with various contractions; and Corrugations or ſhrinkings up, and did hinder both the ſpirits flowing in, being too much burthened with an hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneous <hi>Copula,</hi> from their due irradiation, and alſo variouſly moving thoſe implanted in every part, did incite them, as it were with a diabolical Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo that no more obeying the Empire of the will, they ran into inordinate motions, and did renew them; tranſlated rapidly here ahd there, with a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall reciprocation.</p>
                     <p>But, altho the heterogeneous particles, being poured forth with the blood, into the brain, and thence thruſt forth into the nervous ſtock, did not enter rightly the beginnings of all the nerves, but chiefly and almoſt only the ſpinal marrow, and its nervous ſhoots; ſo that the internal <hi>Viſcera,</hi> alſo the parts of the eyes, mouth, and face, remained free from any Convulſion: yet, that ſame exploſive force, being hindred by ſome violence, whereby it entred leſs in the outward members, preſently like wild-fire, a way being found, it was wont to run into the <hi>praecordia,</hi> and bowells of the lower belly: <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the inflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits, being ſtruck with a certain fury, and requiring a larger ſpace, in which they might exerciſe their madneſs, being excluded from one place, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently enter another ſomewhere open: wherefore, if that fury had been repulſed, both from the members, and the <hi>viſcera,</hi> no doubt but it would have flown back on the brain, and brought thither, madneſs, or as it were an Epileptical Inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs: which Symptoms indeed hapned to be wanting, for that the brain of this moſt ingenious Gentlewoman, being indued with a more firm Conſtitution, did take from the nervous Liquor freſhly inſtilled, whatſoever was congruous and ſpiritous, for its proper food, and enjoy'd it: In the mean time, it did depreſs all the morbific particles, into the ſpinal marrow, by which the involuntary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the members were excited, after that manner as we ſaid but now.</p>

                     <p>By theſe it appears clearly, that the ſick Gentlewoman laboured with a two-fold diſeaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> a Palſie, and Convulſion, and that the materiall Cauſe of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was ſomewhat diſtinct: For it ſeems, that the animal ſpirits, every where abounding, being burdened with narcotick particles, were almoſt continually bound: beſides that, in the time of ſleeping, together with the nervous juiee, the Convulſive particles, plentifully flowing in, clove alſo to the ſpirits: for the exploſions of which, the ſpirits being incited, produced the involuntary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but alſo at that time, the narcotic <hi>Copula</hi> being ſomewhat ſhaken off, they were then able in ſome ſort to perform the voluntary or regular alſo: Beſides the Remedies but now recited, they did carefully adminiſter very many others, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of every kinde, <hi>viz.</hi> Antiſcorbuticks, antiparaleticks, Decoctions, ſudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificks, or ſweating medicines, diſtilled waters, ſpirits, Elixirs, Tincture, Baths, Liniments, with many others; by the uſe of which, the Symptoms were ſomething remitted, but yet the diſeaſe was not wholly cured, the univerſal pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſoon ceaſed, that ſhe was able at any time to move her Limbs, and to bend them here and there; and alſo the involuntary motions did trouble her but rarely, yet ſhe continued Languiſhing, and weak; and when ſhe being of a more fine temper, and prone to a Conſumption, by reaſon tranſpiration was hindred, the recrements of the bloods being laid up in the Lungs, brought in a Cough, which every day growing worſe, ſhe at length dyed of a <hi>Phthiſis</hi> or waſting.</p>

                     <p>In this Caſe, as in the former, it appears, clearly, that the Animal ſpirits,<note place="margin">The nature and cauſe of the diſcribed caſe.</note> not only thoſe implanted in this or that part or region, had contracted an hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneous <hi>Copula</hi> to be ſhaken off by ſome turns, but alſo the ſpirits influencing ſome nerves, being imbued with exploſive particles, had brought in the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and wandring Convulſive Motions. And when at firſt it hapned, that the ſpirits ſo afflicted, did aſſolt, not all the nerves together, nor any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, but for the moſt part, only thoſe belonging to the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and the <hi>Appendixes</hi> of the ſpinal marrow, ſo that within thoſe ſpaces, the fury of the ſpirits, perpetually exploſing, was limited, for this reaſon it hapned, that the convulſive affections being reſtrained, in any one of thoſe parts, did break forth more furiouſly ſtrait in another; and when by their proper inſtinct, their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive force was imployed in one Region, the ſame was in the mean time, wont to be remitted in another. Moreover in this ſick perſon, the morbific matter, conſiſting both of narcotick and convulſive particles, cauſed together the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytick, and convulſive diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>Coming to her on the 4th day, I gave her an Emetick potion, by which ſhe vomited 7 times, abundance of ropy phlegm, with yellow choller, yet without any eaſe: on the next day, I took ſix ounces of blood, from her left Arm, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently from thence, the blood being more impetuouſly carried, towards the head, ſhe complained mightily of an head-ach, and giddineſs; But within 3 days ſhe being let blood in the foot, found her ſelf better: ſhe afterwards took Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for the diſtempers of the nerves, to wit, <hi>ſpirits of Harts-horn,</hi> and of <hi>blood, Bezoartick</hi> and <hi>ſhelly powders, Julaps,</hi> and <hi>Electuaries,</hi> antiſpaſmodical: by the uſe of theſe, the Symptoms ſeem'd to be ſomething remitted, but yet they remained ſomewhat after the manner but now deſcribed: After a fortnight, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a certain Country-Woman, ſhe took in a draught of beer, 6 ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls of <hi>blood,</hi> taken from the ear of an Aſſe, by which ſhe ſeem'd on a ſudden to be cured: for forthwith all the Convulſive motions did leave, and ſhe remained free from them 24 hours; but yet the diſeaſe returning the next day, with its wonted fierceneſs, would not give place, neither to that Remedy, nor indeed eaſily to any others: ſhe therefore for the future, took medicines methodically preſcribed: Once within 6 days, ſhe was gently purged, beſides ſhe took the powder compoſed of <hi>Bezoar, pearls,</hi> and <hi>Corrall,</hi> with the roots and ſeeds of <hi>Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony,</hi> alſo an Electuary, preſcribed by <hi>Horſtius</hi> for theſe kinde of admirable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions; alſo <hi>Julap,</hi> and <hi>decoctions,</hi> proper in convulſive Diſtempters: <hi>Clyſters</hi> were often uſed, frictious, oyntments, and veſicatories were adminiſtred with ſucceſs: within another week, the ſobbing affection wholly ceaſed, and likewiſe the other convulſive motions, being grown more gentle by degrees, very much remitted: Growing well of theſe diſtempers, a <hi>Catharr</hi> falling down in her throat, ſhe was ſo much troubled, that ſhe almoſt continually ſpit forth a ſharp, and as it were Corroſive ſpittle, as if ſhe had had a ſalivation by taking <hi>Mercury:</hi> which kinde of Remedy indeed, hath been found to have been the laſt event in this caſe: but I wholly abſtained from adminiſtring it, becauſe both the ſick, and her friends, would not give me leave.</p>

Only ſhe complained, that oftentimes in a day, ſhe

was ſuddenly afflicted, for about a minute of an hour, with a ſhivering of her whole body; which kinde of Diſtemper coming upon her ſometimes in the night, broke her ſleep: within the ſpace of a month, this Symptom alſo, and likewiſe her Catarrh wholly ceaſed: But from thence, ſhe was ſometimes afflicted with an extream Soureneſs, in her ventricle, and the paſſage of the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> and ſometimes alſo in her mouth, and pallate, that it was feared leſt the inward skin being fretted, thoſe parts ſhould Contract an ulcerous diſpoſition; beſides ſhe was wont to be tormented often in her ſleep, ſometimes alſo being awake, with the night-mare or <hi>Incubus.</hi> For this I preſcribed, <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>fall,</hi> a gentle purge to be adminiſtred, with the uſe of antiſcorbutick Remedies, and ſometimes <hi>Chalibiates,</hi> or medicines of <hi>prepared ſteel,</hi> which kinde of method ſhe obſerved ſo much to her benefit, that ſhe was well in health for many years, and is as yet well.</p>
                     <p>Among the many Remedies, which were taken againſt that Sourneſs, and as it were ulcerous diſpoſition of the pallat, and <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> I preſcribed, that ſhe ſhould drink every morning, her own urine freſh made; this, whilſt it was very Saltiſh, was wont to give her great eaſe; but at ſometimes, her urine flow'd from her thin and plentifully, which being nothing ſalt, but like to ſour vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, from the drinking of that ſhe received little or no benefit.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſon of the Caſe but now deſcribed, ſeems not much unlike the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, unleſs that in this ſick Gentlewoman, the exploſive particles had enter'd into more paſſages of the nerves, to wit, beſides the <hi>appendixes</hi> of the ſpinall marrow, into thoſe dedicated for the office of breathing, and alſo by fits, into thoſe deſigned for the motion of the Tongue, and almoſt perpetually tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Spirits abounding in them, with Rage or fury.</p>
                     <p>But that the Cure of this Diſeaſe hapen'd, by the falling down of the ſharp humour, into the emunctories of the mouth, and throat, we may from thence gather, that the material Cauſe of this, was the heterogeneous particles, and as it were nitrous, begotten in the blood; which, when from thence, being paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thorow from the brain, they were carried into the nervous ſtock, cauſed the aforeſaid Diſtempers: But aſſoon as by the help of Remedies, the more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full proviſion of that matter was hinderd, and the morbifick particles allready produced, both from the blood, and the Brain, and nervous ſtock, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived into thoſe emunctories of the head, the Convulſive Diſtemper preſently ceaſed, and within a ſhort time, ſuch a Criſis or ſecretion ſtill remaining, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Cure of the Diſeaſe followed.</p>
                     <p>Foraſmuch as the urine, being of it ſelf very ſalt, and as it were lixivial, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came at ſome times ſouriſh, which did not give any help, as the former, to the ſourneſs of the throat: it may hence be gathered, that the ſalt particles of the blood, and humours, coming away by the urine, had a twofold ſtate or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit, of fixedneſs, and fluedneſs; wherefore the ſerum, imbued by them, became now of this, now of that nature: for it ſeems, that the Saline particles, being degenerate within the maſs of the blood, remained fixed, and rendred the urine for the moſt part Lixiviall: but thoſe which flowed without the blood, in the nervous juce, or were laid up about the ſolid parts, did degenerate into a flux or acetouſneſs: and therefore from theſe, being derived into the emunctuaries of the mouth, that noted ſourneſs of the mouth, and <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> proceeded: moreover, when theſe kinde of particles, being gathered to a fullneſs in the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous juce, and ſolid parts, did ſwell up, and ariſing to a fluxion, boyled up into the blood: preſently theſe being ſent away from thence, in heaps, thorow the Reines, rendred the urine, increaſed in quantity, ſouriſh. But foraſmuch, as the Saline particles, being of a divers Condition, and that thoſe of the ſame kinde could not be mingled together, they mutually moved againſt one another, and break their forces, therefore the ſalt urine, and not the ſour healed the ſourneſs of the throat. It appears by a vulgar experiment, that the moſt ſharp <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> by the mixture of the <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> or any other lixivial, grows very milde: yea, and yet from thence appears, that the acid humour, ſweating out into the parts of the mouth and throat of this Gentlewoman, came near the nature of ſharp <hi>Vitriol;</hi> becauſe the fume of Tobacco, being taken at the mouth of the ſick perſon, was wonderfully ſweet, as it happens to ſuch, who have beforehand taſted <hi>Vitriol.</hi>

At firſt ſhe was troubled, though not in any grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous manner, with an head-ach, and giddineſs for many days; then ſhe felt, now in one of her arms, and then in another, a trembling and ſudden Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction; which kinde of Convulſions, returning often that day, endured ſcarce a moment; the next day ſitting nigh her Siſter in a Chair, ſuddenly leaping out, ſhe fetch'd one or two jumps, and many others ſucceſſively, with wonderfull agility, at the diſtance of many feet; then, when ſhe was come to the farther part of the Chamber, ſhe ſtood leaping a great while in the ſame place, and every time to a great height; when her legs were quite tired with leaping, ſhe fell on the floor, and preſently ſhe flung her head here and there with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull violence, as if ſhe would ſhake it from her neck: As ſoon as ſhe ceaſed from this motion for wearineſs, preſently the ſame fury invaded her hands and feet, ſo that ſhe was forced ſtrongly to exerciſe theſe members, by ſtriking the walls or poſts, or by beating the pavement: when by reaſon of ſhame or mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, due to her friends, and by-ſtanders, ſhe did hinder her ſelf with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, from theſe motions (for all the while ſhe was her ſelf, and ſpake ſoberly) the diſtemper being ſent inwardly, ſhe was very much infeſted, with a mighty oppreſſion of the heart, with a bemoaning and very noiſefull ſobbing; then, when ſhe would eaſe her ſelf, ſhe was forced preſently, the fury being tranſmitted to the muſcles of the outward Limbs, either to leap about, or to fling here and there cruelly her head, or arms, or alſo to run about the Chamber, moſt ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or to beat the ground with her feet: becauſe theſe kinde of vehement moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of her Limbs or <hi>viſcera,</hi> in the Tragedy of the diſtemper, did mutually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve themſeives, returning as it were in a round.</p>
                     <p>Coming the 5th. day after this Lady had been ſick,<note place="margin">The Curatory Method.</note> I gave her a vomit of the fuſion of <hi>Crocus Mettallorum, wine of ſquills,</hi> and <hi>ſalt of Vitriol,</hi> by which ſhe vomited 7 times, cancker'd oile or choller, in a great plenty, with the mixture of a ſharp, and as it were vitriolic humour: The next day ten ounces of blood was taken from the <hi>Saphana</hi> vein; beſides, ſhe took twice in a day, antidotes of the <hi>powders</hi> of pretious Stones, of <hi>humane ſkull,</hi> and the <hi>root</hi> of the <hi>male paeony.</hi> By the uſe of theſe, within a week, ſhe ſeem'd to be cured, ſhe continued for many days afterwards free from the aforeſaid diſtempers: But after two weeks at the time of the full Moon ſhe fell into a relapſe of the ſame diſeaſe more cruell than before, for beſides thoſe wonderfull leapings, and vehement Converſions and roulings about of her head and members, ſhe was forced beſides, to fetch often a moſt rapid courſe round about the Chamber: ſhe began at this time, from the praeſcripts of others, to take anti-hyſterical Remedies, and purges at certain ſet intervalls, but without any help: At laſt, I being ſent for, becauſe ſhe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med indued with a ſtrong habit of body, and with a notable fierceneſs of ſpirits, I gave her a ſtronger Emetick, by which ſhe vomited forth ten times, greeniſh Choller, like to ruſt, with phlegm, ſharp like ſtygian water, and ſhe was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly eaſed: After this, I gave her every morning, a draught of white-wine, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with the <hi>water</hi> of <hi>black Cherries,</hi> with ſows or hog-lice bruiſed and infuſed therein, and ſtrongly preſſed forth.

                     <p>When ſhe had thus been ſick for three weeks, one day I was ſent for, that I might take notice of all the Symptoms, and the whole figure of the diſeaſe: ſhe being up about ten in the morning, was well, in her Countenance, going, and ſpeech, ſhe behaved her ſelf exceeding well, ſo that none would ever ſuſpect her to be ſick: at eleven of the clock, ſhe began to complain of a fullneſs of her head, and numbneſs of Spirits, with a light ſwimning; by and by ſhe felt a great pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and as it were the leaping of ſome live animal, in her left <hi>hypochondrium:</hi> putting my hand on her ſide I plainly perceived this motion; then a ſtretching and belching followed, which done, ſhe was preſently put to bed, and a maid ſiting upon a pillow held her down; who during the fit, moſt ſtrictly graſpt the ſick perſon, holding her to her boſom, with her arms foulded about her waſt: beſides ſervants were ready, and her relations ſtanding by, who now preſs'd down
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:152521:250"/>
her belly, and <hi>hypochondria</hi> riſing up, and ſwelling to a great bulk, now held her hands and arms. The chief Symptoms of the Diſeaſe, which being excited by turns, almoſt divided the whole fit, were theſe two, <hi>viz.</hi> one while Cruel Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of the Bowells did infeſt her, ſo that the <hi>abdomen,</hi> riſing up into a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bulk, ſtrove againſt the hands of the by-ſtanders, held upon it, that it could not be preſſed down; and at the ſame time, her <hi>Praecordia,</hi> being contracted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the motions of her blood and heart, were almoſt ſtop't: in which ſpace of time, this virgin, her head falling down, with a ſmall pulſe, and almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out voice, lay nigh ſenſleſs; after two or three minutes of an hour, theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions ceaſed: and then the ſick perſon, ſetting her ſelf upright, look'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout cheerfully, and for a while, the force of the diſeaſe changed into talking and ſinging, both of which ſhe without ceaſing performed, moſt pleaſantly and moſt elegantly, beyond her proper capacity: with theſe kinde of ſpeeches, and pleaſant jeaſts, ſhe fell upon all the ſtanders by, that nothing in a Comedy could be more pleaſant; then ſhe utterd moſt ſweet tunes of muſick, and more pleaſant, than any other could, or her ſelf at another time: After ſhe had paſt ſix or ſeven minutes of an hour, thus jeſting and ſinging, the Convulſions of her Bowells and <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and the want of ſpeech, came upon her as before: and theſe ſoon remitting, the force of the Spirits leaping back, from the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior nerves on the brain, it was laſtly imployed in the pleaſantneſs of ſpeech and Songs; as often, when ſhe talkt to the by-ſtanders, as any of them replyed any thing bitterly or reproachfully, ſhe fell into thoſe moſt grievous, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er continuing, Convulſions of the <hi>Viſcera:</hi> After this manner, ſhe was wont to be moleſted, with an alternate diſtemper of the Bowells, and brain, about the ſpace of an hour: Then towards the end of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> the fit declining, more light Convulſions being made, they repeated three or four times without any intermiſſion, then theſe wholly ceaſing, the force of the diſeaſe brake forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her outward members, from whence it quickly vaniſhed: for her Arms and Legs, for a minute of an hour, ſuffer'd leapings forth, and Contractions; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after, the ſick perſon being taken up, left ber bed, free from all Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, till a new fit returned; yea, indifferently well in ſtrength, ſhe walk'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the houſe, and during the interval of her diſtemper, ſhe cheerfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the accuſtomed Offices of Life, excepting that her ſtomack languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings all day ſhe loathed food, in the evening, after the ſecond fit, ſhe ſupp'd mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratly.</p>
                     <p>This was the preſent ſtate of the Diſeaſe, in whoſe fits, the more clear uſe of ſome faculties, ſeem'd in a manner to Compenſate the irregularity of others: But about the beginning of her ſickneſs, it was ſomewhat otherways: for the Convulſions of her bowells, were far more grievous, and an inſenſibility was joyned to them: beſides, in their intervall, talking idly, an incongruous ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yea both laughter and weeping, without any known reaſon, breaking forth, were wont to follow one another: but now, the animal Spirits being forced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to longer exploſions, performed them ſo regularly, now this, now that, as a more Commodious way was made, that they ſeemed after a manner, to be done by the Command of the will, and of Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>That we may therefore, according to our <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> frame an <hi>Aetiology</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional account of this Diſtemper; In the firſt place, it ſeems,<note place="margin">The reaſons of the aforeſaid Diſtemper.</note> that a vehement fear, did drive the Spirits inhabiting the brain and <hi>Praecordia,</hi> into great diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: ſo that, they being diſturbed out of their ranks, both the kinde of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or fooliſhneſs, and the frequent ſwooning ſucceeded: Further, it may be ſuſpected, that from the ſame impreſſion, the hurt was carried to the brain it ſelf, ſo that its conformation being ſomewhat vitiated, the heterogeneous and morbific particles, were admitted together with the nervous juice: Then, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſpirits at the beginning, being confuſed and troubled, after their ſhort inordinations, at laſt recovered themſelves, and performed the wonted offices both of the animal and vital function; yet by reaſon of the taint, impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on the brain, the heterogeneous particles being conſtantly admitted, clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to thoſe Spirits, induced exploſive endeavors, as ſoon as the ſpirits were filled to a plentitude, with the extraneous <hi>Copula,</hi> they being irritated, entred into Convulſive exploſions for the ſhaking or ſtriking it off.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of the Diſeaſe, when both the Diſpoſition of the Brain,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:152521:251"/>
and the Spirits inhabiting it, was more perverſe, and vitious, from the freſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived hurt, a fullneſs of the heterogeneous <hi>Copula</hi> ſooner happened, and ſo its exploſion following more often, and more inordinately, was diſpatched with greater tumult; But afterwards, when the hurt of the animal regiment abating, the ſupplements of that <hi>Copula,</hi> even as thc nervous Liquor, were dayly brought in with an equall dimention, the exploſions of the Spirits being made regular, and more milde, obſerved their juſt periods or ſet times.</p>
                     <p>That ſhe felt, upon the approach of the fit, a fullneſs and as it were an inflati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in her head, with an heavineſs, and dullneſs of the ſpirits, the Reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at this time, the ſpirits inhabiting the brain, being now prepared for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſions, were wont firſt of all to be moved, and as it were to ſwell up; then that pulſation in her left <hi>hypochondria</hi> ſucceeded; for that the Spirits inhabiting the nervous foldings, and <hi>fibres,</hi> thickly planted about the Spleen, began to be exploded: afterwards, when the Spirits flowing both within the meſenteric, and Cardiac enfoldings, were exploded rogether, thoſe elevations, and as it were leapings up of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and <hi>Thorax,</hi> were induced: and when in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, the motions of the blood and heart were almoſt wholly ſtopped, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was a ſmall and almoſt no pulſe, and ſhe became Speechleſſe, and in a manner ſenſleſs.</p>
                     <p>The Convulſion of the <hi>Viſeera</hi> and <hi>Praecordia</hi> remitting, a pratling and ſinging ſucceeded, becauſe a falling down or removal of the Spirits as yet exploded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made from the nervous ſtock, into the brain, it changed the Convulſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an exaltation of the fancy, and more ready exerciſe of the phantaſms, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the Imagination: So long as the Spirits, within the middle of the brain, are regularly and orderly exploded, they bring forth the Acts of the habits and faculties ſo much more noble, and as it were above the ſtrength, and tenour of Nature, as in this ſick Gentlewoman: but on the contrary, when the exploſions of the Spirits in that Region, happen to be inordinate, they cauſe for the moſt part fooliſhneſs, or at leaſt the exerciſe of their powers, are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous and abſurd.</p>
                     <p>The Convulſions of the Bowels, and the phantaſtic actions, releiv'd one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mutually, and by turns, becauſe plenty of Spirits, being diſpoſed to be ſtruck off, made their tendency, as it were with a direct and reflected waving or undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, now on this part, now on that by turns: then laſtly, when they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all exploded, the more often Convulſions of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> were ſtir'd up; and when a ſmall handfull only remained to be exploded, that being at laſt exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both from the head and bowells, it ran forth into the ſpinal marrow, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the laſt aſſolt of the diſeaſe, in the Convulſions af the Arms and Legs.</p>
                     <p>There yet remains one great difficulty in this Caſe, why the fits of this diſeaſe, were always repeated exactly at ſet hours, and yet had ſo unequall periods, to wit, that the Coming of the firſt, was only but ſix hours before the ſecond, and then the return of the next, did not hapen but in 18 hours ſpace. For the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of this, it is to be ſuppoſed, that theſe fits did depend upon the nervous juice being ſtuffed to a plenitude, with heterogenious particles: which particles were altogether conveyed thither from the bloody maſs, and the blood did drink up the ſame, from the nouriſhing juice, ſent as a ſupply from the Bowells: Theſe being thus ſuppoſed, we muſt conſider, in what ſpace of time, the bloody maſs is filled with thoſe morbific particles, and then, in what meaſure, it pours them forth into the nervous Liquor. As to theſe, that it may the better appear after what manner it was done, in the caſe of this ſick perſon, you muſt know, that ſhe took in 24. hours ſpace, only at one time, a full meal: to wit, after the ſecond fit was ended ſhe ſupped moderately about 7 of the Clock; the reſt of the day wanting an Appetite, ſhe hardly took any food, therefore it is probable, that the morbific matter, was poured forth together with the nutritious proviſion, into the bloody maſs, chiefly in the night time; and that more plentifully, than that all could preſently be derived, into the nervous Liquor: The heterogeneous particles, which are firſt conveyed from the blood, newly ſatisfyed, into the nervous Liquor, being heaped up to the fulneſs, did excite the firſt fit, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of which therefore was longer delayed, becauſe both one ſpace is required wherein the blood, and then another wherein the brain and nerves, are to be filled: after this fit was over, becauſe the blood yet full, containing in it ſelf more
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:152521:251"/>
particles, of the ſame kinde, pours them ſuddenly on the nervous juice, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other fit is induced, within thrice the ſpace of the former: but this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, becauſe both the bloody maſs, and the nervous juice, are wholly freed from their burthen, the ſick perſon finding her ſelf better, than at any other time, took her food greedily enough; but after that, when to the next following fit, firſt the bloody maſs, and then the nervous juice, ought to be filled with the morbific matter, therefore 10. hours are required for this double task: but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch, as there is only need, for the ſecond fit, that the other particles ſhould be derived from the bloody maſs, yet full, into the nervous juice, therefore for this effect, a much leſs ſpace doth ſuffice, <hi>viz.</hi> of 6 hours.</p>
                     <p>After I had ſeen this Lady, who had labour'd for many weeks with theſe kinde of periodicall fits, I order'd, that three hours before the ſecond fit,<note place="margin">The Curatory Method.</note> ten ounces of blood, ſhould be taken out of the vein on the foot; which being done, the coming of the fit, in the evening being expected, quite left her, neither did it return at all afterwards; but the other fit, obſerving its former time, dayly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, till the Patient being let blood, a little before its coming, remained that day free from the diſeaſe, which however returning the day after, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſame manner, exerciſed her for many months: In the mean time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the cold of the winter was very great, ſhe forbore for ſome time the uſe of remedies: but the ſpring coming on, this honourable Lady being brought to <hi>Oxford,</hi> was Cured by the following method.</p>
                     <p>Firſt I gave her this Cathartick, and I took care, that it was repeated every 6th. or 7th. day.

                     <p>In the mean time, whilſt this method of healing was ordained; her hair being ſhaven from her head, it was covered only with a thin covering: She wore upon her Belly, an Hyſterical plaiſter mixed with <hi>Galbanum:</hi> for her ordinary drink, ſhe took a <hi>Bochet</hi> of <hi>Sarſa,</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> the <hi>roots</hi> of the <hi>male-Paeony,</hi> and other proper things, infuſed in <hi>Spring-water</hi> and boyled.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:152521:252"/>
it will not be eaſie to aſſigne, either fit remedies for this herculean diſeaſe, or a certain method of Cure, approved by often experience: for beſides, that theſe like caſes are ſeldome met with, it is likewiſe obſerved, that the ſame Medicines which at this time were helpfull to this ſick perſon, being given to another, or to the ſame, helpt nothing at another time: The reaſon of which ſeems to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the cauſe of the Diſeaſe conſiſts in the diſcraſie, or evill diſpoſition of the nervous juice, which Liquor, is not always perverted, after one and the ſame manner: But by the manifold combination of the ſalts and Sulphures, it gets a morbid nature of a various manner and kinde, and oftentimes changes it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the moſt grievious diſtempers of this kinde, not the vulgar medicines, taken from the ſhops or diſpenſatory, are to be preſcribed, but magiſtralls, as cauſe ariſes, according to the appearances of the admirable Symptoms. A gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vomit, Purge, blood-letting, ought in the firſt place to be ordained, and to be repeated, as often as ſhall ſeem fit. As to ſpeciſick medicines alſo, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate in theſe caſes, when the chief Indication ſhall be, to mend the temper of the Nervous juice, you may try many, and by their effect judge of their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: Therefore it may be lawfull, to try, what the Remedies indued with a volatile or armoniac ſalt, may effect. For this end, the ſpirits and ſalts, of Harts-horn, Blood, ſoot, and the flowers and ſpirits of <hi>Sal-armoniac,</hi> are taken: Theſe helping nothing, you muſt come to Chalybiats or Steel medicines; the tinctures and ſolutions of Corall and Antimony are given: which kinde of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are exhibited, in ſuch a doſe, and form, and ſo often, that ſome alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be made by them, on the whole blood or nervous juce: Further, If ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe ſhall fail in ſuch like, you muſt then proceed to <hi>Alexipharmaca,</hi> which help againſt poyſons, and the malignancy impreſſed on the humours: to wit, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute from theſe, decoctions, and diſtilled waters of vegitables, powders, Conſerves, and other preparations; and to compound variouſly ſome with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to adminiſter them diverſly. It is likely, that thoſe kinde of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which are wont to be helpfull to ſuch, as are bitten by a viper, or a mad Dog, or that have taken woulfs-bane, or poyſon, may be uſefull alſo in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Convulſions. It may be lawfull here, according to the example of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Horſtius,</hi> in his tract of the malignant Convulſive diſeaſe, and alſo of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Convulſions, to preſcribe magiſterial Remedies, in the form of a purging Electuary, and alſo of a powder, and Convulſive Antidote, and to compound them variouſly, partly of ſimple <hi>Alexipharmacks,</hi> or poyſon reſiſters, and partly of <hi>Antiepilepticks,</hi> or things good againſt the falling Evil.</p>

                     <p>THE hyſterical paſſion is of ſo ill fame, among the Diſeaſes belonging to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that like one half damn'd, it bears the faults of many other Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: For when at any time, a ſicknbſs happens in a womans body, of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual manner, or more occult original, ſo that its Cauſe lyes hid, and the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory Indication is altogether uncertain, preſently we accuſe the evill influence of the womb, (which for the moſt part is innocent) and in every unuſual Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, we declare it to be ſomething hyſterical, and ſo to this Scope, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is only the ſubterfuge of Ignorance, the medical Intentions, and uſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are directed.</p>

                        <hi>vertigo,</hi> an inverſion, or rolling about of the eyes, oftentimes laughing, or weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, abſurd talking, ſometimes want of ſpeech, and motionleſs, with an obſcure or no pulſe, and deadiſh aſpect, ſometimes Convulſive motions, in the face and Limbs, and ſometimes in the whole body, are excited: But univerſal Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions rarely happen, and not unleſs this diſeaſe be in the very worſt ſtate: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, for the moſt part, the Tragedy of the Fit is acted without Contraction of the members, only in the inferior belly, <hi>Thorax,</hi> and head, to wit, in ſome of them, or ſucceſſively in all: women of every age, and Condition, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to theſe kinde of Diſtempers, to wit, Rich and poor, Virgins, wives, and widdows: I have obſerved thoſe Symptoms in maids before ripe age, alſo in old women after their flowers have left them; yea, ſometimes the ſame kinde of Paſſions infeſt men, as plainly appeared by the example already ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>As to the cauſes of thoſe ſymptoms, moſt ancient,<note place="margin">The cauſes of the Symptoms inquired into.</note> and indeed Modern Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, refer them to the aſcent of the womb, and vapours elevated from it: The former opinion, although it plead antiquity, ſeems the leſs probable, for that the body of the womb is of ſo ſmall bulk, in virgins, and widdows, and is ſo ſtrictly tyed by the neighbouring parts round about, that it cannot of it ſelf be moved, or aſccnd from its place, nor could its motion be felt, if there were any: as to that vulgar opinion, or Reaſon taken from the vapours, we have often rejected it as wholly vain, and light, for juſt reaſons elſewhere: But we judge, the paſſions but now deſcribed, do neither always, nor at all proceed from the aſcent, or the vapours of the womb: and that indeed, other very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Phyſitians, have already determined: For in times paſt. <hi>Charles Piſo,</hi> and of late the moſt learned <hi>Highmore,</hi> have vindicated the womb from all fault; and the paſſions, which are commonly call'd hyſtericall, are thought by this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ariſe from the blood, moſt impetuouſly ruſhing on the Lungs; and by the other, from a ſerous colluives heaped together neer the <hi>origin</hi> of the Nerves. How probable this latter opinion doth ſeem, ſhall appear from what follows: But as to the opinion deliver'd by Doctor <hi>Highmore,</hi> concerning this thing, tho it be far from our Cuſtom to contradict any ones opinion, and that it is almoſt unlawfull for me, to diffent from this famous man; yet, becauſe our Pathologie ſtanding on a contrary <hi>baſis,</hi> (viz. the cauſe of the hyſtericall diſtemper being imputed more immediately to the nervous ſtock, than to the blood) will ſeem to be only aſſerted, unleſs we ſhew the Reaſons, which combat againſt that <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi> and forours, therefore taking leave, here we will try more exactly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion, put as it were in a ballance.</p>
                     <p>In the fit therefore commonly called hyſterical, this famous man ſuppoſes,<note place="margin">Doctor <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores</hi> Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> the blood, for that it is thin, flatulent, and with a certain efferveſcency, to ruſh too much in heaps, into the pneumonick veſſells, and the veſſells of the heart, and in them to broyl up impetuouſly, and ſo to ſtuff up the lungs, and very much to aggravate them, that neither they can exerciſe their motion, nor that the blood can be drained from the boſom of the heart: Hence, from the blood ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in the <hi>Praeoordia,</hi> a great oppreſſion, difficult breathing, and often none, with a melting of the vital Spirits were wont to be inferred: then the <hi>diaphrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> that it might give place to the Lungs more and more diſtended, and that breathing at leaſt might be ſome way made, is carried downward, with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and long continued <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> and ſo by preſſing down the Inteſtines, it lifts up the <hi>ahdomen,</hi> and <hi>hypochondria,</hi> and feins a motion as it were the ariſing of a globe: But afterwards, the vital function labouring after this manner, the animal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ariſes in its aide, wherefore, a neceſſity of motions, in various parts urging the animal Spirits, being driven impetuouſly into the beginnings of the nerves, produce divers manners of Convulſions, running here and there. The Author endeavours to confirm this Opinion, by the great help in this diſeaſe had, by the taking away the bloody excretion, both from things helpfull, and things hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in this paffion.</p>
                     <p>But though I cannot but praiſe this Doctrine of the ſuffocation of the womb, as very ingenious, and cunningly wrought, yet that I do not conſent to it in all things, ſome reaſons of great moment clearly hinder me. Truly I confeſs, that I do not underſtand, how in ſome hyſterical perſons, to wit, who are of a more frigid temperament, and are often troubled with the Pica, and longing diſeaſe; the blood ſhould so immoderatly boyl up in the Lungs, without any conſpicuous
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:152521:253"/>
notes of its growing hot, in ſome other place. I have known young maids, by reaſon of the green-ſickneſs, as it were without blood, to wit, whoſe blood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed being without life, did remain without any exerciſe in the heart, and was from thence diffic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ltly enough drawn forth, into the Lungs, who yet were grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly obnoxious to the paſſions called hyſterical: Certainly it is not probable, that the blood of theſe perſons growing immoderatly hot, ſhould ruſh impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly into the Pneumonick veſſells, and ſhould ſtuff up their pores and paſſages very thickly, when in the mean time, ſuch become ſhort-breath'd, by reaſon of the abſence of the blood from the Lungs, or its difficult admiſſion to them: Beſides, by what means comes it to paſs, that this violent courſe of the blood into the Lungs, which is ſuppoſed to be made in this Fit, brings forth no Inflammation in them? for that the blood, being too much heaped, or rapidly put into any part, is eaſily extravaſated, and is wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite an Inflammation hardly to be ſhaken off. From whence it is therefore, in the hyſterical diſtemper, the blood entring violently into the Lungs, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtending them, does not cauſe a peripneumonie or impoſtume of the Lungs? Or wherefore the diſtempers as it were hyſterical, come not on an Inflammation of the Lungs, otherwiſe cauſed? wherefore it ſeems improbable, that the blood ſwelling up, with its proper anger or heat, ſhould ruſh into the Lungs, and by ſtuffing them, renders them too immovable, and ſo ſecondarily and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly induce Convulſions of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and other parts: but it may rather ſeem, that by reaſon of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and other organs of breathing, being firſt affected with a Convulſion, the blood ſhould be forced to ſtagnate in the <hi>praecordia:</hi> Beſides, it may be obſerv'd, that the Lungs are not always afflicted before other parts; for oftentimes the convulſive Symptoms begin elſewhere, and not rarely bear the region of the breaſt wholly untouch'd: Becauſe in ſome, the <hi>vertigo,</hi> and Corruſcations or ſparklings of the eyes, begin the fit, to which ſucceed either weeping, or laughing, or convulſive motions of the Limbs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſtraitneſs of the breath, or oppreſſion of the heart: in others, before reſpiration troubles them, any way, a ſwelling in the bottom of the belly, with a vomiting, and rumbling of the belly, begins and often ends the fit; ſo that the difficulty of breathing, oftentimes follows theſe Symptoms at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and is wont to be prevented, by the tying ſtrictly of ſwathing-bands, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>hypochondria.</hi> Moveover, it ſeems, that this aſcent as it were of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain round thing, from the <hi>Hypogaſtrium</hi> or lower part of the belly, can never proceed from the depreſſion of the <hi>Diaphragma;</hi> becauſe in the hyſterical fit, this part is not always preſſed down towards the lower parts, but oftentimes drawn up to the higher parts, and drives the Lungs upwards, ſo that the ſpirit or breath being almoſt ſhut forth, threatens the danger of Choaking. By theſe, and other reaſons,<note place="margin">The hyſtericall diſtemper chiefly belongs to the Brain and nervous ſtock.</note> we are at length perſwaded to that opinion, that the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per named from the womb, is chiefly and primarily convulſive, and chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the brain and the nervous ſtock being affected, and whatever inordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or irregularity from thence happens, about the motion of the blood, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecondary, and is made dependingly, by the Convulſions of the Bowells.</p>
                     <p>But that this doth conſiſt within the bounds of the head, both the comparing of the ſymptoms, which happen in the living, and the anatomical obſervations of the dead, clearly ſhew; becauſe we may obſerve, that this diſtemper often takes its riſe, from a ſudden fear, great ſadneſſe, or anger, or other violent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in which the ſpirits inhabiting the brain are chiefly affected beſides, to ſome an ill manner of dyet, and various accidents whereby the humours being vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are heaped more plentifully within the head, at firſt brings this evil. Yea, the manner of the fits clearly evinces the ſame, foraſmuch, as a fullneſs of the head, a <hi>vertigo,</hi> a ſparkling of the eyes, a ringing noyſe of the ears, begin in many the hyſterical fit, and often conclude it: Beſides I have opened ſome wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, dead of other diſeaſes, tho while they were ſick, very obnoxious to hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical paſſions, in whom the womb being very well, I have found in the hinder part of the head, the beginnings of the nerves, moiſtned and wholly drowned with a ſharp <hi>ſerum,</hi> as ſhall be more largely declared anon.</p>
                     <p>Having weighed theſe, and other Reaſons, we doubt not to aſſert, the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons commonly called Hyſterical, to ariſe moſt often, for that the animal ſpirits, poſſeſſing the beginning of the Nerves within the head, are infected with ſome
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:152521:253"/>
taint; to wit, they being either acted or brought into Confuſion, or being tincted with vitious humours, get to themſelves an heterogeneous and exploſive <hi>Copula,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The cauſe of the diſeaſe, moſt often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, about the beginnings of the nerves.</note> which they carry far away with themſelves, into the Channells of the nerves: and when the ſame ſpirits are filled to a plenitude, with that <hi>Copula,</hi> thorow all their <hi>ſeries</hi> or orders, either of their own accord, or being occaſionally moved, they enter into exploſions, and ſo ſtir up Convulſive motions: But that ſuch a <hi>Copula</hi> adhering to the ſpirits, is chiefly derived together with them, into the interior nerves, the reaſon is, becauſe in this paſſage towards the <hi>praecordia,</hi> and <hi>viſcera,</hi> the animal ſpirits, by reaſon of the diſtemper of the minde, are very much diſturbed; wherefore, they more eaſily admit any evills brought from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, and more readily conceive irregularities. For the animal ſpirits, chiefly for this occaſion, contract a convulſive diſpoſition: foraſmuch as they, from a violent impreſſion, are perverted out of their Courſes, and their wonted manner of Influence, and acting; hence they not only repeat their inordinations, but alſo receive the heterogenious particles into their embraces, and more eaſily combine with them: Wherefore, foraſmuch as the animal ſpirits, running thorow the nerves of the wandring pair, and Intercoſtals, are continually entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with all perturbations both of the Concupiſcable, and iraſcible Appetite, it is no wonder, if they acquire a convulſive diſpoſition, before the reſt.</p>
                     <p>It being ſuppoſed (which indeed ought to be ſuppoſed) that the animal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits have contracted an heterogenious and exploſive <hi>Copula,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The ſame cauſe after<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, thorow the whole paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Nerves.</note> now the nervous <hi>origines,</hi> and carried it together with it ſelf into the interior nerves, and ſpread it thorow all their paſſages, it will not be hard to aſſigne the Reaſons of the hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall fit, and of all its Symptoms. For firſt of all, the diſeaſe being ready to fall upon one, oftentimes the <hi>Vertigo,</hi> a rolling about of the eyes, and a certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flation of the brain, as it were praevious skirmiſhings, are ſtirred up, becauſe the whole band of the Spirits, being in readineſs for exploſions, the more light com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of them, leaping back towards the brain, are firſt ſtruck off; then Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently a perturbation ſucceeds, in the bottom of the belly, or <hi>hypochondria,</hi> for that the Spirits within the enfoldings here and there, are next diſturbed: For we have elſewhere ſhown, if at any time the animal Spirits are exploded, in a certain whole <hi>Series,</hi> thoſe which abode in the extream parts, firſt of all enter into that aſſertion: Wherefore the beginnings of this Diſeaſe, are found to be or the moſt Part, in the head and Bowells: but that the Convulſions are firſt perceived, now in the bottom of the belly, now in the <hi>hypochondria,</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe the morbific matter, is ſometimes carried by the paſſage of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal nerve, into the utmoſt meſenteric enfoldings; but ſometimes the ſame, being ſlid down, not beyond the ends of the wandring pair, ſubſiſts much neerer, to wit, about the enfoldings of the ſpleen, or ſtomack.</p>
                     <p>When therefore the animal Spirits (as hath been ſhown) within the nervs of the wandring pair, and intercoſtals, are imbued from their <hi>origine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The reaſon of the hyſterical ſymptoms un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded.</note> even to their utmoſt ends, with an heterogeneous and exploſive <hi>Copula;</hi> they at length, either from mere fullneſs, or by an irritation ſomewhere made, are ſtirred up to explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; in which affection, if any Spirits leap forth towards the middle of the brain, they induce the <hi>Vertigo,</hi> the inflation and other praevious accidents of the head: but the Spirits inhabiting the other extremity of the nervous Trunk, <hi>viz.</hi> the meſenteric enfoldings begin chiefly to be exploded, which preſently by their letting off, compell the lower Parts of the <hi>hypogaſtrum</hi> to be lifted up, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted upwards, and ſo induce the aſcention of a certain bulk, as it were of the womb: then, when the upper parts of the enfoldings of the meſentory, are by degrees intangled with the ſame diſtemper, and the bowells annexed to the ſame are elevated, and drawn forceably towards the upper parts, the violent ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> as it were with a certain leaping forth ſucceeds: Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Ventricle is not only elevated, by changing its place, all its <hi>fibres,</hi> to wit, the direct, oblique, and tranſverſe, being affected at once, with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, is often diſtended like a blown bladder: hence very often vomiting, or at leaſt a rumbling, and murmur of the <hi>hypochondria,</hi> are excited: but as ſoon as the Spirits being exploded, with a certain <hi>ſeries,</hi> it comes to the Region of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> the <hi>diaphragma</hi> being drawn together, with an huge diaſtole is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times depreſſed, and ſo meeting with the aſcention of the <hi>viſcera,</hi> cauſes an Inflation, and high intumeſcency or ſwelling up, with a mighty ſtrugling; ſo that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:152521:254"/>
the laces of thoſe in this diſtemper, muſt be forthwith looſned, or elſe they are in danger of falling into a trance: In the mean time, the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> being ſo depreſſed, and its diaſtole continued, the bloud remains almoſt immovable in the <hi>praecordia:</hi> and ſo by its ſtagnation, cauſes a great oppreſſion, and very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

It ſometimes happens, that the animal ſpirits, planted within the brain, and in the paſſage leading from it, to the <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia,</hi> are very much diſturbed, by a ſudden paſſion, as of fear, anger, ſadneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And forced into diſorders; and that by that means, they being driven out of their orders, do acquire to themſelves heterogeneous particles, whereever met with; and combine with theſe, that by and by, for that reaſon, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an exploſive diſpoſition, as we have already declared. Further in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, ſometimes the morbific matter it ſelf, being made more fierce and ſtrong, in ſpite of the ſuccour of the animal <hi>Aeconomie</hi> or rule, is poured forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the brain, and its appendix, from the bloody maſs, which cleaving faſt to the ſpirits, preſently diſpoſes them into exploſions: This is ordinarily diſcerned

in the evil criſes of feavours, alſo in ſome malignant diſtempers, alſo in Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butic and other Chronical diſeaſes ill cured. An ill, or weak conſtitution of the brain, or nervous ſtock, whether it be hereditarie, or acquired by reaſon of an ill manner of living, very much cheriſhes theſe cauſes. For in bodies ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, both the animal ſpirits, from every light occaſion, are moved in Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the paſſages of the brain, and nervous <hi>Syſtem,</hi> more eaſily lye open, for the running in of the heterogeneous, and exploſive matter. In truth, for this reaſon, women are more obnoxious to convulſive diſtempers, than men, and ſome women then others, as we will ſhew more largely hereafter.</p>
                     <p>But altho theſe kinde of paſſions of women, called hyſterical, moſt often proceed from the fault of the head, or from the morbific cauſe, ariſing within the <hi>Encephalon;</hi> yet ſometimes, ſuch diſtempers are ſtirred up,<note place="margin">Or near the womb, or other Inwards.</note> by reaſon of a Cauſe beginning ſomewhere elſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Now in the womb, now in the other Bowells; and of this Convulſive Pathologie, there are chiefly two heads, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1ſt. Sometimes it happens, that a Tumour, or an ulcer,<note place="margin">This laſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens after a twofold man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> or a congeſtion of ſharp humours, ariſes in the membranous parts, about the womb, or planted about the other <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and often irritates the parts ſo diſtemper'd, by reaſon of the breaking of the union, into painfull Convulſions: then foraſmuch as the animal ſpirits, placed round about, and thoſe inflowing,<note place="margin">Either by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the union.</note> are moved into fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent diſorders, they at length, getting to themſeves heterogeneous particles, ſent either from the diſtemper'd part, or from ſome other place, are diſpoſed to convulſive aſſaults, and when firſt of all, the convulſive motions happen only in the neighbourhood of the affected place, to wit, that the bulk aſcending in the lower part of the belly, or its ſwelling up be only perceived; afterwards they are propagated by the paſſage of the nervous bodies, and by the conſent of the convulſion there begun, leaſurely into the other <hi>viſcera,</hi> of the lower belly, then to the <hi>praecordia,</hi> and laſtly into the head it ſelf; and the diſtemper, being thus by little and little delated to the ſpirits inhabiting the brain, they moreover having gotten in their proper Sphear, an heterogeneous <hi>Copula,</hi> retort the ſame back to the <hi>viſcera,</hi> and ſo the morbific cauſe, being made reciprocall, is begun at either end of the nervous Trunk. Some time paſt I have ſeen a noble virgin, in whom a ſmall Tumour ariſing, with moſt cruel pain, below the <hi>Os pubis,</hi> did ſtir up huge Convulſions; firſt in the lower belly, and afterwards aſcending to the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and head, were at length ſtretch'd to the outward members: for once or twice in a day, after that great pains did torment her in the affected part, the <hi>abdomen,</hi> and by and by the <hi>hypochondria,</hi> were wont to be lifted up: then difficulty of breathing, on an Inſenſibility ſucceeded, and preſently the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper being brought outwardly, moſt horrid Convulſions, and Contractions of the members, and Limbs followed. Sometimes it alſo happens, that convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſymptoms are induced in Child-bearing women, by reaſon of ſome hurt or evill brought to the womb: <hi>Harvie</hi> Relates, that wonderfull convulſions were cauſed by the injection of ſome ſharp thing into the womb: So ſometimes, tho rarely, it happens, that a morbific matter or exploſive <hi>Copula</hi> is fixed to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits dwelling about the extremities of the nerves and near the womb, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the place there affected and without fault of the brain.</p>
                     <p>There yet remains another caſe, or manner of affecting,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> Or by reaſon of an obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Nervous juice.</note> by which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive diſpoſition is produced from the fault or the parts, lodg'd at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the brain (tho in the mean time, the taint, which is the cauſe of this diſtemper, is often mediately communicated to the brain it ſelf) to wit, when at any time, the nervous juice is hindred ſomewhere, in its motion or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, from thence ſtagnating in the nervous parts, and loading them, does often bring in a convulſive diſpoſition: So, when ſome uſual Evacuation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſuperfluities of the nervous Liquor, were wont to be ſifted forth, is ſtopp'd, as from Iſſues ſuddenly ſhut up, or old ulcers dryed up without a purge, many fall into convulſive diſtempers: Yea, it may obtain here ſome place, what is wont commonly to be noted for a cauſe, of the hyſterical paſſions, in maids and widdows, to wit, the untimely reſtraint of the ſeminall humour, which ought to be beſtowed about the pleaſure of <hi>Venus;</hi> at leaſt, if they receive help from the ſtate of a conjugal Life, it therefore happens, becauſe the reſtagnations of the nervous humour, which often fix a taint to the brain and nervous ſtock, by this means are prevented: Moreover, the nervous juice flows back towards its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:152521:255"/>
becauſe its paſſage is ſomewhere ſhut up, by a ſwelling or cancrous Tumour. Laſtly in this City, a notable inſtance of this kinde of diſtemper hapned, <hi>viz.</hi> A certain maid of 12. years of age, had contracted an <hi>hernia</hi> or burſtneſs, hence by the order of her Mother, ſhe wore a truſs ill fitted, for a fortnight, not without great pain and torment, a little hard knot much preſſing upon the <hi>glandulas</hi> of the Groin: within this ſpace (when before ſhe was perfectly well) ſhe began to complain of a giddineſs and heavy dulneſs of her head; and ſo a little after, ſhe felt convulſive, and as it were hyſterical diſtempers, frequently ſalling upon her; rogether with it great ſwellings aroſe behinde her ears, and in her neck of the ſame ſide, to which ſhe was never before obnoxious in all her life. It is not to be doubted in this caſe, but that from thoſe <hi>Glandulas,</hi> which are the Emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries, or ſinks of the nervous Liquor, being too much preſſed together, the ſuperfluities of that humour, wont to be ſent away from thence, by the Lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic veſſells, reſtagnating in the head, brought forth thoſe evills: becauſe the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing of the aforeſaid ſymptoms, ſo ſuddenly and manifeſtly followed, upon the wearing of that Truſs upon the Groin, that even her Mother laid the cauſe of the Diſeaſe, upon that occaſion. Beſides alſo I have obſerved in others, the recrements of the nervous humour, being ſomewhere ſtopp'd in their Courſe, reſtagnating towards the head, have not only brought in convulſive ſymptoms, but from thence the <hi>Kings Evill.</hi>

                     <p>That we may wipe off theſe objections, we ſay firſt, that the ſymptoms, which ſeem hyſterical, do not only happen to women: for we have ſhown already, by the hiſtory brought by us, that a certain man has been obnoxious to thoſe kinde of fits, with the aſcention of a bulk in the bottom of the belly: but that women are much more often troubled with thoſe convulſive diſeaſes than men, two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be ſhown, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, for that their animal conſtitution is much wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: to wit, they have the brain and nerves ſofter, and of a leſs firm texture, that they are not able to ſuffer any thing ſtrongly, or to reſiſt every injury; alſo the animal ſpirits in them, being more prone to flight and diſtraction, more eaſily admit an heterogeneous and exploſive <hi>Copula:</hi> from hence Women, from any ſudden terror or great ſadneſs, fall into mighty diſorder of ſpirits, when men from the ſame occaſion, are ſcarcely diſturb'd at all. Secondly, women more readily receive the convulſive diſpoſition, becauſe they gather a more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull heap of the morbific matter: for that, whilſt they lead for the moſt part a ſedentary Life, the blood, for want of ventilation, becomes more impure; beſides in this ſex it originally abounds with heterogeneous and fermentative particles; wherefore it is convenient for it, to be more often purged, by the flux of their Courſes; by which notwithſtanding, not always what is extrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and incongruous, is wholly caſt forth, from the bloody Maſs, but that there remains, that which being poured on the brain, and its appendix, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is given, becomes the cauſe of the convulſive diſtemper: Moreover, when the menſtrual flux, being ſtop'd, a convulſive diſpoſition is occaſioned, it is not therefore to be thought, that ſuch a diſtemper is rais'd up from the womb, but that the bloody maſs, being more than uſually imbued, with heterogeneous particles, carries them, together with the nervous juice, to the head: yea, chiefly for this reaſon alſo, child-bearing women, are found obnoxious to the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:152521:255"/>
paſſions, as it were hyſterical, for beſides that the membranes of the womb being hurt, a convulſion there begun, by reaſon of the felt trouble, creeps up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and is at laſt communicated to the head; it moſt often happens, that the blood being infected, by the termes being retained, grows hot with a feavouriſh burning, and then inſtead of a <hi>criſis,</hi> the malignant infection, is carried to the brain, from whence convulſive, and not ſeldom ſoporiferous, or ſleepy diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, are excited.</p>
                     <p>But that it is argued, that this diſeaſe ſeems to be hyſterical, becauſe Remedies applyed about the <hi>abdomen,</hi> often bring help; it will be eaſy to ſhew, that the morbific cauſe planted in the meſentery, oftner than in the womb, is ſometimes either taken away by that means, or reſtrained from its Influence: beſides, the ſame kinde of applications, about the <hi>hypogaſtrium,</hi> are no leſs profitable, altho the original of the diſtemper, be derived from the head it ſelf: for we have ſhewn before, that when the heterogeneous, and exploſive matter, deſcending from the head, brings a convulſive diſpoſition, to the ſpirits diſpoſed within the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the interior nerves; the convulſive motions therefore excited, begin from the extremities of the nerves, and ſo creep upwards towards their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; ſo that firſt of all the <hi>viſcera</hi> of the lower belly, then the <hi>praecordia,</hi> and laſtly the brain it ſelf are affected; but if the outmoſt ſpirits, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the enfoldings of the meſentery, be reſtrained from entring into exploſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all the reſt, in the remaining nervous paſſage, continue in their orders: and this, plaiſters worn upon the navel, do often effect: for they repreſs, and compel into order, with their odour, the ſpirits from leaping forth; yea alſo, not ſeldom, they ſhake off and drive away; the <hi>Copula</hi> cleaving to them: wherefore, when the exploſions there about to be made, are reſtrained, the convulſive fit is wholly prevented: which yet is more apparent, for that, if the Convulſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the lower belly, and from thence aſcending like a Globe, be preſently ſuppreſſed, and by a ſtrong binding together of thoſe parts, it be hindred that it creep not upwards, oftentimes the convulſive paſſion is broken off, the <hi>praecordia,</hi> and the brain being untouch'd: wherefore it is a common cuſtome, for ſick wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to binde ſtrictly the <hi>Epigaſtrium,</hi> with ſwaths or rolers, and ſo to ſtop the progreſs of the ſymptoms, towards the upper parts: For when the animal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, enter into Convulſions ſucceſſively, as it were a fiery enkindling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the tinder, or cheriſhing matter is cut off, or intercepted, the diſtemper is there reſtrained.</p>
                     <p>As to the various effects of odors, to wit, that ſweet things bring on the fit, but ſtinking things drive the ſame away, it may be ſaid, that the former do loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the animal ſpirits, by pleaſing them, and too much releaſe them from their wonted tasks of Influence, and ſo provoke them ready to be exploded, in ſuch diſorders, yea and as a flame put to them, do ſomewhat inkindle them: but on the contrary, ſtinking things repreſs the ſpirits, drive them back from excurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and exorbitances, and compell them into order, yea like ſulphur, mixt with <hi>aurum fulminans,</hi> take away from them their exploſive force.</p>
                     <p>What we have hitherto ſaid, of the paſſions called from the womb hyſterical, will yet more clearly appear, if for the Confirmation of our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> we ſhall add arguments taken from anatomical obſervations; I will therefore lay before you a notable Caſe, by which the former reaſon, and Cauſes of the convulſive diſtempers, may be very much illuſtrated.</p>
                     <p>A very noble Lady of a moſt curious ſhape,<note place="margin">Obſervations.</note> and highly indued with a virtuous diſpoſition, of minde and manners, of late lived near to this place, who being for many years obnoxious to convulſive diſtempers, for that ſhe had originally, or hereditarily contracted this ſickly diſpoſition, and had experienc'd the fruits of this morbid ſeed, almoſt every luſtre of her age, but chiefly as often as ſhe was with child, (for ſhe very frequently miſcarried) was wont to be tormented above meaſure, with convulſive paſſions, as it were hyſterical; becauſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the reſtraint of her monthly flowers, the heterogeneous particles being tranſlated to the brain and nervous ſtock, cauſed fits of this moſt cruell di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</p>
                     <p>After ſhe had newly conceived, in the firſt months, according to her old cuſtom, ſhe was preſently moleſted with convulſive diſtempers; about the nineth week of her big belly, from taking cold, ſhe fell into a dangerous feavour, in which very
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:152521:256"/>
acute pains tormenting her, in her loyns and bottom of her belly, for many days, ſeem'd to threaten an abortion: but theſe pains, as the event ſhew'd, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be termed Colical, proceeded from a ſharp humour, falling down into thoſe parts, from the brain, by the pipes of the nerves; for towards the declining of the feavour, this matter being ſomewhere elſe tranſlated, a great looſneſs or Diarrhaea, pains of the feet, and as it were an ulcerous diſpoſition ſucceeded.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as this Lady became well from her feavour, and thoſe pains, the convulſive diſtempers returned, for every morning, wakeing from ſleep, ſhe was wont to ſuffer Convulſions, and cruel contractions, about the parts of her face and mouth, as alſo in her armes and thighs; which ſymptoms, without doubt, did ariſe from a ſerous heap or gathering, laid up in the head, about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the nerves; and by them imbibed, together with the nervous juice, more deeply in ſleep; and when afterwards the ſame matter, was carried by the pipe of the interior nerves, into the foldings of the Meſentery, and loyns, moſt cruel pains of thoſe parts, and alſo fits as it were hyſterical, did moſt grievouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect her.</p>
                     <p>But theſe convulſive motions of her face and members, after a little time ceaſed, but yet ſhe ſtill remained weak, and without ſtrength, with a pale coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, an infirm and trembling gate, and deſirous only of congruous food, and hot Liquors: about the end of the third month, at which time ſhe was wont continually to miſcarry, her <hi>menſtrua</hi> broke forth, which coming away for two or three days together, with little pieces of broken membranes, ſhe expected to miſcarry: But that flux ceaſing, pains as it were of one in labour, in her <hi>abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> and loyns, as before aroſe, and for the ſpace of a week, tormented her day and night; at length, having uſed a bath of <hi>Emollient</hi> herbs, and afterwards put to bed to ſweat, ſhe brought forth the burthen of her womb: the conception ſo coming away with mighty pain, was about the bigneſs, and like the figure of a Turkie egg: the exterior coat of it was torn and broken, the interior remaining whole, contained about half a pint of clear water and nothing elſe beſides; there appeared no ſhape of a childe, or any rudiments that it would ever be one: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards for 4. or 5. days, her flowers flowed forth, with ſome pieces of broken membrances: in the mean time, pains with their wonted fierceneſs tormented her, and when the ſpace of a week being elapſed, they left not off of themſelves, remedies at length were ſought to allay them.</p>
                     <p>To this end, firſt Liniments, Fomentations, Baths, and Clyſters, were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten adminiſtred; alſo medicines purging the filth of the womb, on which the cauſe of all the evill was caſt, were taken inwardly: Short intermiſſions of her tortures, followed upon the uſe of the former; but then the diſtemper returned, with great trouble; yea the diſeaſe much increaſing, in three weeks time, got many other horrid ſymptoms: for beſides the pains in her belly and loyns, which became more cruel every day, alſo ſhe was ſhortly after tormented in her back, neck, ſhoulders, as alſo in her arms and thighs, with moſt cruell pain; and that more bitterly, as ſoon as ſhe was warm in her bed; beſides, ſhe was afflicted with a frequent giddineſs, vomiting, and nauſeouſneſs, and often in a day, with moſt grievous convulſive fits, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt a bulk was ſeen to aſcend in the bottom of her belly, and preſently it lifted up her whole belly forceably, by and by reſpiration being reſtrained, an Inſenſibility, with a dead countenance ſucceeded: after that, ſhe had thus lain as one dead, for three or four minuts of an hour, ſhe was wont ſuddenly to leap up, that ſhe could hardly be held down, or kept by thoſe ſtanding by; then follow'd cruell contractions, and diſtortions in all the parts of the mouth, and face, as alſo in all the members of the body: Theſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms were indeed judg'd to be hyſterical, becauſe this noble Lady ſo lately had miſcarried.</p>
                     <p>But weighing every one of theſe, I was at laſt of this opinion, that the cauſe of either fit, <hi>viz.</hi> Both the <hi>dolorifick,</hi> and the convulſive, did depend wholly on the evill affection of the brain, and nervous ſtock, and that without any fault of the womb; for that a ſharp humour, being heaped up within the head, did from thence deſcend thorow the paſſages of the Nerves, into parts at a great diſtance; which lodging upon the membranes and <hi>fibres,</hi> and fermenting with the humour, flowing in from the bloody maſs, did irritate them very much, and ſo ſtir'd up moſt cruel pains: Then afterwards, when the heterogeneous and exploſive par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,

being admitted with what humour within the head, and entring into the nervous paſſages, did cleave to the ſpirits; therefore the convulſive diſpoſition, then breaking forth into grievous fits, was induced, as ſhall be by and by more largely laid open.</p>
                     <p>Inſtituting Curatory Intentions, according to this kinde of <hi>Aetiology,</hi> I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to have blood taken from this ſick Lady, at what time ſhe moſt grievouſly laboured, out of the <hi>Saphena vein,</hi> and within two days, to be given her a gentle Cathartick, and that to be reiterated, once or twice in a week: Alſo on other days, Morning and Evening, I gave her ſpirits of <hi>Harts-horn,</hi> and at other hours, twice or thrice in a day, of the <hi>powder of Pearls</hi> and <hi>Crabs-eyes,</hi> with a doſe of the following Julap. Take of the <hi>water of Snails,</hi> and of <hi>worms magiſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> each ℥ iii. of <hi>Saxifrage,</hi> and <hi>black cherries</hi> each ℥ iiii. of <hi>hyſterical water</hi> ℥ ii. of the <hi>ſyrrop of Corralls</hi> ℥ i ſs. of the <hi>tincture of Coſtor</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> i. mingle them: The bath of ſweet herbs was frequently uſed, when neceſſity urged, ſhe took <hi>Opiats</hi> always with good ſucceſs: <hi>Veſicatories</hi> were applyed to the inward part of either thigh, alſo to the hinder part of her neck; alſo <hi>Fomentations, Oyntments, Clyſters, Cuping-glaſſes, Sneezing-powders,</hi> with many other manner of adminiſtrations were preſcribed, according to the exigences of the ſymptoms.</p>
                     <p>By this method obſerved for about 14. days, the noble Lady having received very much eaſe, was wholly rid of her convulſive fits. Yea, the torments of her Bowells and members, and the other ſymptoms being very much leſſen'd, ſhe hoped quickly to recover her health: But after this, partly by reaſon of an ill or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of dyet, which the ſick Lady always indulg'd her ſelf in, or taking little, but chiefly, by reaſon of a ſudden paſſion of fear and ſadneſs, which an unluckie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident hapning within her own houſe, had cauſed, ſhe fell into a relaps, by and by the diſeaſe growing into a much worſe Condition, for both the Convulſions, and pains, did infeſt her more bitterly; yea and her ſtomach being almoſt tyred out, with continual vomiting, would not admit either of food or medicines. She took Aſſes milk for ſome days, with ſome ſucceſs; which notwithſtanding, for as much as breeding Choller in her ſtomach, ſhe found it troubleſome, ſhe ſhortly omitted: at length in ſpite of all Remedies, preſcribed carefully by the Conſultation of many Phyſitians, my noble patient from day to day grew worſe, and by degrees death approached: Two days before her death, the torments of her belly and loyns very much abated, and ſhe became more than uſually chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and conceived ſome hope of Recovery; But in the mean time ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of a pain and great heavyneſs in her head; and about the beginning of the night ſhe ſelpt foundly, but being awakened ſhe fell into a very horrid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive fit, which preſently paſs'd into a quick deadly <hi>Apoplexie,</hi> for being made inſenſible, and ſpeechleſs, ſhe left this life within twelve hours.</p>
                     <p>When various judgments had paſſed, about the cauſe of the ſickneſs,<note place="margin">The rational account of the diſeaſe taken from anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> of which this illuſtrious Lady dyed, moſt flinging all the evills on the diſtemper of the womb, others on an Ulcer or Impoſthum, which they ſuſpected lay hid, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where about the <hi>viſcera</hi> of the <hi>abdomen;</hi> it pleaſed her friends, that her dead Carcaſe, kept long opened for the Funeral, ſhould be dilligently inſpected, and ſo the genuine Cauſes of the diſeaſe, and her death, might be inveſtigated; which task being left to my care, I executed with all the dilligence I was able.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in the firſt place, it was worth obſervation, about the habit of the body, that the members and lower parts, nigh and beyond the ſeats of the pains, were very much waſted; as her thighs, quite worn away, appeared like a Skelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton: In the mean time, her face, neck, and arms, remained full, and plump enough: from whence it appears, that the nervous Liquor, does help no leſs to the buſineſs of nouriſhment, than to the exerciſe of the animal faculty: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when that Liquor, being much hindred in its paſſage, the loyns and belly, taken up with the continual Convulſions, did not deſcend, with a due influx, to the inferior parts, they for that reaſon, became preſently both without ſtrength, and lean, and waſted. This kinde of Atrophie, differs in this, from other hectical waſting, which happens from the vice of the blood, becauſe in this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, an hippocratick or waniſh face, is the chief ſigne of the Diſeaſe, in that firſt mention'd, the countenance, and aſpect, ſhow little or nothing of evill.</p>
                     <p>The dead body of this noble Lady, tho very lean, and that her bowells were
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:152521:257"/>
all the emptied, yet quickly putrified, for within 40. hours all the skin was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd, and appeared in this part livid, in that green, and in others blackiſh; and her Corps ſo ſuddenly putryfying, yielded a moſt horrid ſmell, the reaſon of which without doubt was, that by reaſon the muſcles were exerciſed with perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Convulſions, the principles of their mixture, were ſo much looſned, that they being in a readineſs for diſſolution, quickly after death, fell aſunder one from another, after the like manner, as we may obſerve of the fleſh of wilde beaſts, which being tyred with a long courſe, or beaten to death with Clubs, for this much ſooner putrifies, then the fleſh of thoſe, which are kill'd quickly, and peaceably.</p>
                     <p>Her belly being opened, the Inteſtines, and ventricle appeared whole enough, <hi>viz.</hi> Intire and well colour'd, but they were emptie, and as it were blown up, for as much as they were troubled, almoſt with perpetual evacuations, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe placed above or below: in all this Cavity, no foot ſteps of an Ulcer, or Impoſthum were perceived. Whilſt we were ſearching the cauſe of the diſeaſe, and rolling the Inwards here and there, there was ſomething met within the meſentery, worthy notice, to wit, about its middle, where it is fixed to the back, and contained the greater folds of the nerves, a ſubſtance ſomewhat looſe, and inflated, as it were with many little bladders, equalling an hands breadth, was ſeen, after that manner, as when in a ſhoulder of Veal, the inter-ſpace of the muſcles, are blown up, by the Butchers, that thoſe parts might ſwell up, and ſeem fuller, and fatter: In this place of the meſentery, becauſe it was more tumid and ſofter, we thought ſome humour, the cauſe of the pain, to lodg there, but opening it, I found only the membranes to have been looſned one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to conclude nothing but winde, within its inter-ſpaces: which ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the membranes, and devulſion one from another was without doubt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, by the frequent Convulſions or exploſions of the ſpirits, which within the enfoldings, and nervous <hi>fibres,</hi> there thickly planted, were almoſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally provoked; and thoſe Convulſions hapned, by reaſon of the heterogeneous, and exploſive particles being derived thither, from the head, by the pipe of the Nerves.</p>
                     <p>But as to thoſe torments of the belly, and as it were an aſcent of a bulk or ſubſtance in the convulſive diſtempers, and the inflation of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> it is not to be doubted, but that the ſeat of the morbific cauſe, did lye hid in that part of the meſentery: but becauſe ſo much ſuſpition was had of the womb, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chiefly affected, we did next inquire how much this Inward deſerv'd it: Therefore having dilligently ſearched the tunnell, placed within the <hi>Os pubis,</hi> I found the womb in its due place, and as to all parts ſound, and well furniſhed: its body was drawn to its juſt proportion, altho it was but 5. weeks ſince ſhe had miſcarried, <hi>viz.</hi> It was like a ſmall pear in figure and magnitude; the <hi>Glandulas</hi> on either ſide of the bottom of it, which are called the teſticles, appeared very ſmall and flaggy, without any ſuperfluous or virulent humour contained in them: the body of the womb, whereever it was diſſected, equal'd a thumbs breadth in thickneſs, its inward Cavity was no bigger than what would hold a bean: within this hollowneſs, as uſe to be in the Caverns of other Inwards, was included a mucous or dreggy matter, in a very ſmall quantity: but in truth, about the womb, or its <hi>appendix,</hi> there was nothing, to which might be imputed as a morbific cauſe, of the ſymptoms but now deſcribed: from whence therefore it may be demonſtratively concluded, as I at firſt thought, that the paſſions termed from the womb hyſterical, are moſt often excited, from ſome other cauſe, than the fault of the womb.</p>
                     <p>The Inteſtines being removed, we found alſo the reins ſound enough, but one of them was of an unuſual figure, <hi>viz.</hi> It was cleft into many lobes, like the Kidney of a Calf.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Milt, Pancreas,</hi> and <hi>Caul</hi> without fault: the <hi>ventricle</hi> was much blown up, and its inward Coat was plain without folds, or wrincles, which certainly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by reaſon of its frequent Vomiting, this Inward being almoſt continually troubled with Convulſions: Beſides, for this reaſon, the tone of the ſtomach being broken, it did neither rightly deſire, or concoct the food, or aliment.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Liver</hi> very much differ'd from a ſound conſtitution, for it was tumid, and ſomewhat hard, of a pail colour, like rotten wood, wholly dry and without
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:152521:257"/>
blood, and this without doubt, the frequent uſe of Cordiall, and highly hot li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors had effected.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lungs</hi> were of a blewiſh colour, and every where obſtructed, and ſtuff'd with a ſtinking and frothy matter: Certainly this Inward and the Liver had been vitiated of a long time, wherefore as the blood being degenerate, and very much depraved of a long time, from its right temper, had yielded the firſt ſeeds of this ſickneſs, ſo alſo it afforded a conſtant cheriſhment of it.</p>
                     <p>But indeed, we ſought, and that not in vain, for the chief and as it were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall cauſe of the diſeaſe, in the head; therefore the skull being taken off, the veſſells of the <hi>Meningae,</hi> and thoſe creeping about the brain, appeared full, and diſtended with blood, when in the reſt of the body, ſcarce any blood had flowed forth, in the cutting of it: the thicker <hi>meninge</hi> being removed, thorow the other thin and pellucid one, was diſcerned a clear water, filling the enfoldings and crevices of the brain, and as it were overflowing its whole ſubſtance: In truth the ſerous heap of waters, had filled full all the Cavities, and inward places of the brain: the enfoldings of the <hi>choroides,</hi> or net-like membranes of the brain, being a long while immerſed in water, and as it were boyled, were become diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd and half rotten: nigh to the beginning of the Splanchnick nerves, or belonging to the Spleen, the water inſinuating it ſelf very much, had ſeparated the <hi>pia mater</hi> from the trunk of the oblong marrow or pith, for two fingers breadth: without doubt, the morbific matter deſcending from the head, by the paſſage of theſe nerves, into the enfolding of the meſentery, was the cauſe of the pains and Convulſions: Further, the ſame matter alſo, afflicting the heads of other nerves, and paffing thorow their pipes, produced afterwards, theſe moſt cruel diſtempers in other parts, to wit, almoſt every where, of the whole body.</p>
                     <p>As to the Cure, or means of healing, uſed in the paſſions commonly called Hyſterical: foraſmuch as the ſymptoms of this diſeaſe are very much convulſive,<note place="margin">The Method of Curlng the hyſterical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.</note> therefore it is fit, that anti-ſpaſmodic or anti-convulſive Remedies, ſuch as were before deſcribed, ſhould be chiefly indicated; but when theſe diſtempers moſt often happen to the female ſex, in whom for the moſt part, the menſtrual flux, and other accidents of the womb do challenge a part in the morbific cauſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore medicines reſpecting the various diſpoſitions of the womb, are to be added to the former, and many ways to be compounded with them. The Therapeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic or Curatory Indications, are either Curatory, to be adminiſter'd in the fit; or preſervatory which are inſtituted out of the fit, that take away the cauſe of the diſeaſe, and prevent its comings or acceſſions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, if the fit is wont to be light, and without other perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpirits, it may be permitted to paſs away of it ſelf;<note place="margin">Curatory.</note> but if it being more heavily troubleſome, there will be need to bring ſome help to nature much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, this only thing is to be done, that the ſpirits being freed from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of an heterogeneous <hi>Copula,</hi> they may remit their inordinations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſions: for this purpoſe, it is grown into uſe, to put to the noſe ſtinking, and ill ſmelling things, the ſcents of which compell, and repreſs the too fierce ſpirits, ready to leap forth, into their orders, and alſo ſhake off from them, the heterogeneous <hi>Copula,</hi> and often drive it quite away: <hi>Aſafaetida, Caſtor, Galba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> being put into fine Linnen and applyed to the noſtrills are convenient; alſo burning of <hi>Partridg feathers, old skins,</hi> and <hi>ſulphur.</hi> Beſides the ſpirits and <hi>oyl of ſut,</hi> or of <hi>Harts-horn</hi> do not ſeldome help: yet I have known theſe kinde of fumigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being very troubleſome to ſome women, to increaſe the fit; it is probable that the ſame ſometimes may too much irritate the ſpirits, and drive them into greater diſorders; and as ſtinking things put to the noſe, ſo the like poured into the mouth, do often bring help: wherefore we give often with good ſucceſs, to hyſterical people, <hi>Tinctures of Caſtor, Solutions of Aſſafaetida,</hi> and <hi>Galbanum, ſpirits of Harts-horn,</hi> and <hi>Sut,</hi> with proper waters.

                        <note place="margin">Preſervatory.</note>2. The preſervatory Indication comprehends theſe three Intentions, <hi>viz.</hi> In the firſt place to take away, or to derive to ſome other place the impurities of the blood, apt to be poured forth on the brain, and nervous ſtock. Secondly, to fortifie the brain, and ſo to ſtrengthen the indwelling ſpirits, that they may either not at all receive, or may eaſily ſhake off the heterogeneous <hi>Copula.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to amend whatſoever is enormous in the womb, and contributes to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt Intention is performed by purging, and phlebotomy, and other common ways of purifying, and purging the blood and humours. If there be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for an emetic, I judge it beſt allways to begin with it, eſpecially in Cacochymicks, or bodies full of evill humors, in the longing diſeaſe, and Pica, and in ſuch whoſe great load of viſcous phlegm, ſtuffed within the folds and coats of the ventricle, hinders the virtues of other medicines: The next day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Vomit, unleſs any thing bids the contrary, let blood be taken, in women of a hotter temper, preſently from the Arm, and afterwards if need be, from the foot, or from the ſedal veins with Leeches; but in bodies troubled with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and leſs hot, let blood be taken more ſparingly, and more rarely, and only in places ſcituate below the womb: After theſe Evacuations (if they are to be ordered) rightly performed, once within ſix or ſeven days, a purge is to be preſcribed according to the following forms.

                     <p>The ſecond Intention, to wit, the rectification of the brain, and animal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, is performed with Cephalic, and properly anti-convulſive medicines: which indeed ate to be diligently exhibited, almoſt every day, when they do not purge or bleed: ſince there are various <hi>ſpecies</hi> of ſuch like Remedies, and ſeveral man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of adminiſtrations, we will here add ſome of the more choice forms.</p>

As to the third Intention, which inhibiting the diſorders of the womb, doth promote the cure of the paſſion called hyſterical; I ſay, firſt of all what in times paſt was believed, concerning the Cauſe and ſcope of curing the diſeaſe, that the womb did aſcend, therefore that it ought to be reduced into its right place; is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together fictitious, as we have elſewhere ſhown: The falling down of the womb, or its coming forth, oftentimes happens; but rarely, or never produces the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterical Diſtempers: Beſides, the diſlocation of the womb in childbearing Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſometimes happens, preſently after their bringing forth, to wit, when the body of the womb being made Capacious, and newly emptied, doth not ſink down or fall within the Tunnel, in its right place, but upwards inclines now to the right ſide, now to the left, and there being drawn together like a purſe, is folded into a great bulk, which kinde of bulk, remaining long, nigh the ſide of the groin, is wont to give a ſuſpition of another child, or the ſecondine or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbirth to be left behinde, or alſo of ſome hard ſwelling tumor there increaſing; but afterwards, when the <hi>menſtruum</hi> coming plentifully away, the womb is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to its due magnitude, that tumor by degrees vaniſhes: but while it there remaineth unleſs for that reaſon, the <hi>Lochia</hi> or <hi>menſtrua</hi> were ſtopp'd, it doth not produce the hyſterical paſſions. For the reducing of this part the ſooner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its due poſition, fomentations, Liniments, and Plaiſters, are convenient. But moſt times that Symptom, paſſes over, of it ſelf, without any further harm. To what other diſtempers the womb is obnoxious, in child-bearing, and by what method to be helped, we have fully ſhown in another place. As to the other vices of that part, which happen to ſome women, not bearing children, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that they chiefly are either a diſeaſe of the womb, made by the breaking of the unity, <hi>viz.</hi> which is either ſome ulcer, or Tumor; or an inhibition of ſome wonted excretion, or putting forth, to wit, a ſuppreſſion either of the menſtruous blood, or the whites, or the ſeminal humour: Moreover becauſe of the <hi>menſtrua</hi> being retained, the heterogeneous particles being often poured forth into the head, bring in the Convulſive paſſions: in like manner, when the whites are ſtopped, the excrementitious matter, being ſupped up by the blood, is deliver'd to the brain and nervous ſtock: yea, when an uſual evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſeed is hindred, the ſuperfluities of the nervous humour, flow back upon the brain, and infect its indwelling Spirits, with an exploſive and morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic tincture: There is no need here, to diſcourſe more largely or particularly, of thoſe Peculiar diſtempers of the womb, but to compound medicines, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate adminiſtrations, proper for womens diſeaſes, with anticonvulſive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>

                     <p>IN the foregoing Chapters, we have clearly ſhown, that the Paſſions called hyſterical, do not allways proceed from the womb, yea, more often from the head being diſtemper'd; next we ſhall inquire concerning the hypochondriacal Diſtempers, of what original and nature they are, and upon the fault of what parts they chiefly depend. The vulgar opinion is, that the ſymptoms wont to accompany this diſeaſe, are wholly produced from the ſpleen; wherefore, they are aſcribed very much to vapours, ariſing from this inward, and variouſly run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up and down, here and there; when in truth, theſe ſickneſſes for the moſt part are convulſions, and contractions, of the nervous parts: but that it might appear, by what cauſes they are wont to be excited, we ought to conſider firſt, the Symptoms themſelves, and to place them into ſome order or rank.</p>

                     <p>The Symptoms which are imputed to this Diſeaſe, are commonly very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and are of a divers nature, neither do they obſerve in all, the like begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or the ſame mutual dependency, among themſelves: for they ſeem in theſe, moſt to affect the Inwards of the lower belly, in thoſe the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> in others the Confines of the Brain: and in moſt, though not in all, the ventricle labours much; concerning the appetite it is often too much, but preſently burthened with what it hath taken in; and when the food, ſtaying longer in it, by reaſon of ſlowneſs of Concoction, their Saline particles being carried forth into a flux, pervert the whole maſs of the Chyle, into a pulſe or pottage, now Sour, or auſtere, now ſalt or ſharp: from hence pains of the heart, great breakings forth of blaſts, rumbling of winde, and often vomiting ſucceed; and becauſe of a pneumatick defect, or of Spirits, the Chyme or juice, is not wholly made volatile, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried forth of doors, but that the ballaſt of the Viſcous or Slimy matter, ſticking to the coats of the ventricle, is left behinde; an almoſt continual Spitting infeſts them; a diſtention in the <hi>hypochondrium,</hi> and often there, and under the ventricle, a cruell pulſation is felt: alſo there pains ordinarily ariſe, which run about here and there, and for many hours miſerably torment with a certain lancing: In the mean time, from the Contractures of the Membranes, and from the fluctuation of winds, ſtirred up by that means, rumbling and murmurs are produced: Alſo in the <hi>Thorax,</hi> oftentimes there is a great conſtriction and ſtraitneſs, that the reſpiration becomes difficult and troubleſome, upon any motion: alſo, moſt grievous aſthmatical fits fall upon ſome: moreover, the ſick are wont to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of a trembling, and palpitation of the heart, with a noted oppreſſion of the ſame: alſo a ſinking down or melting away of the Spirits, and frequent fear of a trance, comes upon them, that the ſick think Death is always ſeiſing them: In this Region, about the membranes, and chiefly the <hi>mediaſtinum,</hi> or that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the middle of the belly, an accute pain, which is now Circumſcrib'd to one part, now extended to the ſhoulders, is a familiar Symptom of this Diſeaſe. But indeed in the head, an Iliad of evills doth for the moſt part diſturb hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal people, to wit, moſt cruell pains returning at ſet times, do ariſe, alſo

the ſwimming of the head, and frequent <hi>Vertigoes,</hi> long watchings, a Sea, and moſt troubleſome fluctuation of thoughts, an uncertainty of minde, a diſturbed fancy, a fear and ſuſpition of every thing, an imaginary poſſeſſion of diſeaſes, from which they are free; alſo very many other diſtractions of Spirits, yea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Melancholly, and madneſs accompany this ſickneſs: beſides theſe interior Regions of the Body beſeiged by this Diſeaſe, wandring pains, alſo Convulſions, and numbneſs, with a ſenſe of pricking, invade almoſt all the outward parts; nightly Sweats, fluſhings of the Blood in the face, and the palms of the hands, eratick feavours, and many other Symptoms, of an uncertain original, do eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where ariſe; concerning which; foraſmuch as the genuine Cauſes, and the manner of their coming to paſs, could not be readily determined, preſently all the fault is caſt upon the Spleen, and Phyſitians accuſe that, as if it were the chief author of every irregular Diſtemper; but by what right or authority, by and by ſhall be ſought into: In the mean time, it is to be obſerved,<note place="margin">The hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the nervous kinde.</note> that the chief Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of this ſickneſs, are Convulſive, and depend immediately upon the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities of the animal Spirits, and the nervous juice, rather than on the evill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> ſerving for Concoction. But indeed, from whence the firſt riſe of this moſt complicated Diſeaſe proceeds, and by what means it brings forth the divers manners of diſtempers, in ſo many places, will not be ſo eaſie to determine.</p>
                     <p>It would be a tedious thing, to ſhew here,<note place="margin">The cauſes of the hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driac paſſion is inquired into.</note> what the ancient and modern Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians thought of the <hi>hypochondriack</hi> Paſſion, and of its eſſence, and Cauſes; we will only take notice, that moſt of them do aſcribe this ſickly Diſpoſition, to the only fault of the Spleen; In the mean time ſome contend that the whole confines of this Inward, partaking of part of the fault, the blood flowing every where in the Splenetick, and Epigaſtric Veſſells (or thoſe belonging to the Spleen and belly) for that it being guilty of an hot and dry intemperature, and ſo obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to too much fermentation, brings forth the original, or gives a beginning to this manifold evill: But the famous <hi>Highmore,</hi> affording relief, as well to the Spleen, as the Womb, hath caſt the chief Cauſe of this Diſeaſe, wholly on the vitious Conſtitution of the ventricle; and from thence, he would have the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the aforeſaid Symptoms, to be originally ſought, But indeed, that he might frame a fit <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> for the ſolving the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of this ſickneſs, he firſt ſuppoſes, the tone of the ſtomach to become too looſe, and weak, that for that reaſon, it hardly, and very imperfectly Concocts the aliments: ſo that the thin, and more Spirituous part of the Chyle, being ſent from thence, ſooner than it ought, to the blood, perverts its diſpoſition, to a hot and ſour temper; then the reſidue of the food, by a longer ſtay, within the Ventricle, degenerates into a ponderous, and viſcous or clammy Phlegme; which alſo, by its Stagnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (even as it is obſervable in things to be eaten, being longer kept) becomes very ſour, or ſharp: But from hence, that learned Man argues, that from the blood made too ſerous and thin, its efferveſcencies quickly paſſing thorow it, are induced: and from the ſtomach, loaded with ballaſt of ropy or viſcous matter, the winde and diſtentions of the Ventricle, and <hi>hypochondria,</hi> as alſo the belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and troubleſome Spitting, do ariſe: whereby indeed, he wholly exempts the Spleen, from this fault, he contends, that it doth neither draw to it ſelf the melancholly dregs of the blood, nor ſerves for any office whatſoever, about the Sanguification or the making of blood; but that its uſe almoſt only conſiſts in this, that this Inward ſwelling up, or growing turgid with very hot blood, it adminiſters heat to the adjacent Ventricle, and cheriſhes it with gentle warmth.</p>
                     <p>Altho I may ſo far aſſent to this famous Author, concerning this opinion,<note place="margin">The Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of Dr. <hi>Highmore</hi> ſifted.</note> that I yield, the ventricle doth often grievouſly labour in this Diſtemper, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the tone of which, being made lax, and its ſtrength broken, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the indigeſtion of the aliment, a load of viſcous Phlegm, or Petui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous matter, is begotten even in its boſom, to which, by reaſon of the Saline particles, being brought into a flux, by their long ſtay, oftentimes a notable ſoarneſs, and auſtereneſs happen; then becauſe the fault in the firſt Concoction is not mended, the dyſcraſies and diſorders of the blood, receive that want of digeſtion in the ſecond: But yet he cannot draw me into that opinion, that the ventricle is always chiefly in the fault, or that the other Symptoms, of the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriacal
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:152521:260"/>
Diſeaſe, depend only on its vitious Conſtitution: For I have known many, cruelly afflicted with this ſickneſs, who have been well enough in their ſtomach: although they have very much complained of the pulſation in the left hypochondrium, of the ſtraitneſs of the breaſt, and a wandring pain excited in it, alſo of the trembling, and oppreſſion of the heart, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual fear, and diſturbed Imagination; in the mean time, they were wont to deſire food greatly, and to digeſt whatſoever was eaten, without any trouble of the ventricle, or heavineſs, and alſo without any ſpitting or acid belching: yea, I have obſerved others, great drinkers, and uſing an evill manner of living, to have contracted a looſneſs of the ſtomach, with an ill digeſtion, windineſs, and frequent vomiting, who ſound enough about their <hi>praecordia,</hi> and animal facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, were not at all accounted for <hi>hypochondriacs:</hi> Beſides, in this Diſtemper, the ventricle is often rather ſick from the vitiouſneſs of other parts, or of the Blood, than from its own default; becauſe, it is uſual for thoſe ſort of ſick people, to be well in their ſtomach, ſo long as they may lye abed, and breath it forth; but when they are raiſed up, the pores being ſhut up, and the dreggineſs of the bloudy maſs ſtagnating within, preſently to be afflicted with the pain of the heart, an aggeſtion of winde, and frequent endeavours to vomit.</p>
                     <p>For theſe, and other Conſiderable Reaſons, I judge the original of the <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacal</hi> Diſeaſe, to be derived from ſome other fountain, than the weakneſs of the Ventricle: but foraſmuch, as among the parts here primarily ſuſpected, to be affected, great complaints are made againſt the Spleen; it will be worth our while, to enquire, what office this Inward doth diſcharge, then, as often as it fails in it, whether it contributes to this Diſeaſe.</p>

                        </note>When I conſider theſe things, which ſometime ſince I have obſerved; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the uſe of the Spleen; it ſeems far more probable, that a certain dreggy portion, <hi>viz.</hi> a matter, conſiſting of an earthly, and fixed ſalt, is layd up in this Inward, by the blood carried to it, by the arteries, which being exalted there as it were by digeſtion, and into the nature of a ferment, is laſtly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the blood, flowing from it by the veins, which inſpires or quickens it, with a certain leven or fermentation, and performs the ſame thing about its Spirit, or making it Spirituous, as our ferment commonly called Leven, doth, being put into a batch of bread or dough; for as a certain portion of the unbak'd bread or dough, being kept to a ſourneſs, preſerves the ſame nature, that it doth ferment or leaven other bread or dough, and ſtirs up in it the otherwiſe ſluggiſh particles into motion; ſo it ſeems, that the blood being laid up in the milt or Spleen, and there getting a ſourneſs, as it were by ſtagnation, puts on the nature of a ferment, whereby indeed the reſt of the maſs of blood, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the other humours, are actuated, and as it were Spiritualiſed, into a more lively motion. What hath been ingeniouſly wrote, by a late author, <hi>viz.</hi> the moſt learned <hi>Velthuſius,</hi> concerning the uſe of the Spleen, may have relation to this: for he hath determined as highly probable, a ferment to be contained in this Inward, whereby the ſluggiſh particles of the blood, are brought into a ſtate of activity: Becauſe, taking notice, that in children, and others indued with a ſanguine temperament, and more fat or dull habit of body, even as their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and diſpoſition of minde were inclined to idleneſs, ſoftneſs, and dulneſs, ſo their Spleen was ever of a reddiſh colour, and full of florid blood, like the Liver: from hence he concludes, that the ſpleen doth but little perform its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:152521:260"/>
in theſe, as the gential parts before ripe age, or in thoſe of weak loyns; but on the contrary, foraſmuch as men of a middle age, and chiefly in thoſe, who are of a ſevere Countenance, and of a lean body, as in them appear marks of cunning, Sagacity, fortitude, and conſtancy, ſo their ſpleen is found to be of a livid or blewiſh colour, and imbued with blood, as it were muddy: further he argues from hence, that the blood, being kept long in the ſpleen, as in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit or receptacle, turns plainly into ferment, by which its remaining maſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence inſpired, is made more ſubtil, and begets more acute Spirits, both in the vital, and in the Animal Kingdom or Government: For he ſuppoſes, our bodies naturally to abound, with too much humidity, by which indeed the function of the parts, and many of the <hi>viſcera,</hi> are very much dull'd: but that the ſpleen, doth communicate to the maſs of blood, ſolid, firm, and conſtant parts, and not eaſily to be diſſipated; and that thoſe do wipe away that moiſtneſs, and with it carry away in ſome meaſure, that ſoftneſs, from the blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which is predominate in tender age: almoſt after the ſame manner, as the north-winde, or the eaſtern gales, fanning and intimately penetrating the air, with the dryneſs and ſtrength of their parts, breathe health or ſtrength to the air, and to our Bodies.</p>
                     <p>But ſince I have in another place, declared what I have formerly thought, concerning the Spleen, there will be no need to repeat it in this: yet I ſhall further note, that in bodies of living creatures, compacted out of a quinarie of elements, as the ſpirits ought to be more ſtrong then the reſt: ſo indeed they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intangled with a viſcous humidity of Sulphur, and water, are ſo hindred, that oftentimes they are not able to exerciſe their ſtrength or powers lively e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; hence ſaline particles, for that they are very much fermenting, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for this, that the ſpirituous little bodies, almoſt overwhelmed by the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace of the others, and ſtupifyed, might lie awakened, and ſet at liberty, and into motion. Wherefore we experience in our ſelves, when the ſpirits are dull'd, by the blood being too much exhal'd, that notable help is brought, by ſharp liquors, as chiefly ſmall wines, and Cider: for theſe kinde of Remedies ſharpen the Spirits, and ſhake off all heavineſs. Such a kinde of fermenting virtue, we eaſily believe to be continually exerciſed, by the Spleen being in right order, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the blood and nervous Liquor.</p>
                     <p>For as this Inward is formed with a threefold ſort of veſſells, <hi>viz.</hi> with arteries, and veins, and beſides with great enfoldings of the nerves, and a moſt thick Contexture of nervous <hi>fibres;</hi> we think the uſe of each of them, to be ſet apart for this end: to wit, by the Arteries, the blood is carried to the Spleen, hence it lays up its dreggs, compoſed of a fixed Salt, and an earthly matter, in its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages and poroſities, and theſe there layd up, as it were by a certain digeſtion, are brought into a juice very fermentive: A portion alſo of which, being carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back to the blood, by the veins, is continually mixed with it: and ſo its whole maſs, is inſpired with thoſe kinde of fermentive particles, from the Spleen; by which, a certain auſterity and ſharpneſs, with vigour of motion, is given unto it; ſo that, for that reaſon, the blood it ſelf is carried more lively in the veſſells; alſo from thence, the nervous juice, procreated from the blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more active ſupplies the animal regiment: But truly, the Spleen doth not only by this means mediatly, and by the intervention of the blood, inſpire the brain and nervous ſtock, with a fermentive virtue; but it may be lawfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that this is done ſomewhat more immediately, by the paſſage of the nerves, diſperſed in the ſpleen: for, becauſe in this part, anatomie diſcovers a great company of Nerves, and nervous enfoldings, and of <hi>fibres</hi> ſpringing from them, it may well be doubted, for what uſe they ſhould ſerve: Concerning this, it is firſt to be obſerv'd, that the ventricle, and the Spleen, have a moſt intimate Commerce with the brain; inſomuch, that <hi>Helmont</hi> did place the ſeat of the Soul, in thoſe Inwards, but this is poſſible to be done, by no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious way, than by the aforeſaid nerves: Wherefore, we may here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly ſuſpect, that not only the animal Spirits, are the meſſengers between the one part, and the other, but alſo, that the nervous Liquour, which is both the food, and the ventricle of theſe ſpirits, doth deſcend now from the brain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theſe Inwards, and now being received from theſe <hi>Viſcera's</hi> by the nerves, doth creep thorow towards the head: which kinde of ſpleeny Juice, being dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:152521:261"/>
to the brain, ſharpens the animal Spirits, and raiſes them up being ſlothfull, and irritates them into quick motions: from whence it is commonly ſaid, the ſharpneſs and ſagacity of the minde, doth proceed from the Spleen, and Sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick people, are accounted Ingenious: But it is probable, that the rage, and force of the paſſions, being begun by the Spirits inhabiting the brain, are carried to the ſpleen, by the paſſage of the nerves; and ſo the ſpirits there dwelling, are pathetically troubled, and the blood flowing thither, is moved into a multitude of perturbations: for from hence it in ſome meaſure falls out, that in anger, ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and other diſtempers of the minde, according as the ferment if the Spleen, being more or leſs moved, is inſpired to the blood, its liquor diverſly boyls up: Further, for this reaſon it happens, that great inflations and Commotions, of the left <hi>hypocondrium,</hi> come upon ſplenitic people, from every violent paſſion.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Influences of the Spleen in producing the ſymptoms unfolded.</note>Firſt, it ſometimes happens, that the ſpongie ſubſtance of the ſpleen, from the faeces of the blood, being too much impacted, in its pores, and ſtagnating, is very much ſtuffed, and obſtructed: that from thence, it doth not ſufficently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the recrements of the bloody maſs: but the ſame being carried thither, but not received do flow back into the neighbouring branches of the Caeliack Artery, from whence they are preſently carried, into the membranes of the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, the Caule, the meſenterie, and other nigh parts, and are wont to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to them; hence the tone of thoſe <hi>viſcera,</hi> are ſo much ſpoyled, that they do not rightly perform their due offices, about the concoction of the Chyle, and the membranes planted every way about, being much imbued with heterogeneous and irritative particles, for that they are almoſt continually pulled by convulſions here and there ſtirred up, they are grievouſly obnoxious to wandring pains, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, diſtentions, and the encreaſe of Windes; by reaſon of this kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurgitation of the blood, from the Spleen, being obſtructed, it is likely, that the pulſation, which is felt by hypochondriacks, under the Ventricle, is excited.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When the faeculencies of the blood, are excluded from the Spleens being obſtructed, being fixed (as was ſaid) to its neighbouring parts, they bring forth the ſickly diſtemper of the left <hi>hypochondrium:</hi> but though indeed, that Inward ſufficently receives the melancholly or atrabilious juice, carried to it from the blood, by the Arteries, yet oftentimes it does not rightly Cook it, but the Salt being too much excited, it changes it into a too ſharp, or acid, auſteer, or ſour; or ſome other kinde of vitious humour: whereby, when as the whole maſs of blood, and the nouriſhable Juice, contained in its boſome, are almoſt wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, the fruits of the hypochondriack ſeeds, bud forth thorow the whole body; the blood grows unduely hot, is in ſome places impetuouſly moved, and again in others is apt to ſtagnate or ſtand ſtill: from hence, it is familiar with Spleene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick people, preſently after eating, to grow red in the face, to have the palms of their hands hot, their hypochondria to ſwell, oppreſſions of the heart, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted variations of the pulſe, to ſucceed, But theſe fermentative particles being tranſlated, from the blood, every where into the ſolid parts, wandring pains, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng

up and down here and there, and a ſenſe of pricking, are ſtirred up in many members of the Body: moreover, from this Infection of the blood, for that its maſs is changed, from a benign and balſamick temper, into a ſalt and tartare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, a lean habit of body, with a black and dark Countenance, is induced.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From the blood being ſo depraved, by the fault of the Spleen, oftentimes the taint is carried to the animal government; for heterogeneous and Convulſive Particles, are poured frequently into the brain, and from thence, into the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſtock; ſo that the animal Spirits, dwelling in either province, conceive various irtegularities: by reaſon of the evill being impreſſed on the head, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacks uſe to be troubled with various phantaſms, with an heap, and fluctuations of thoughts: beſides, to them happen frequent <hi>Vertigoes,</hi> Scotomies, headaches, and often parlytical Diſtempers: then, foraſmuch as the morbific matter, flides down from the head, into the nervous ſtock, Convulſive Diſeaſes are excited, in very many parts of the body, but chiefly about the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the lower belly: for when the Spirits flowing within the nerves, which reſpect thoſe parts, are greatly diſturb'd, by reaſon of the diſtemper of the minde, the Convulſive particles, the more readily enter into thoſe pipes, and more eaſily impreſs on thoſe Spirits, a Convulſive Diſpoſition: Therefore, partly by reaſon of the infection mediatly tranſmitted to the Brain, and partly by reaſon of the hurt, (as hath been ſhown) immediatly Communicated from the Spleen, the Palpitation of the heart, trembling, and frequent ſwooning, Conſtrictions of the Breaſt, impediments of breathing, Pains of the ſtomach, belching, Vomiting, and many other accidents in thoſe Inwards, happen to hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriacks.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Beſides theſe inordinations, which are wont to be derived by the paſſage of the blood, from the Spleen; into the humours and ſollid parts, and to the brain it ſelf, and nervous ſtock; there are other farther evills, which ſeem to ariſe from this Inward, alſo by the paſſage of the nerves: Becauſe, as we have ſhown, their extreme branches, and the nervous <hi>fibres</hi> themſelves, interwoven in the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> do drink in with their outward moſt little mouths, a certain hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and convey it ſometimes upwards, it is highly probable, that the nervous <hi>fibres,</hi> diſtributed to the Spleen, (of which as we but now hinted, there is a mighty Guard) do receive its moſt ſharp juice, which Creeping higher, thorow the nervous pipes, becomes a Cauſe of Convulſive motions: In truth, that there may be thoſe intimate Commerces, between the brain, and the Spleen, to wit, far ſooner, than what can be made, by the compaſſing about of the blood, it may be lawfull to believe, that the nerves of the wandring pair, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal, to be the neereſt means of the paſſage, whereby theſe parts Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate one with the other, and mutually affect themſelves. For it ſeems, that when the black bile or melanchollic tumor in the Spleen, grows turgid or ſwells up of its own accord, or is moved by ſome evident cauſe, its particles enter the nervous <hi>fibres,</hi> thickly diſtributed to the ſame, which diſturb the animal Spirits flowing in them, into exploſions, or at leaſt into ſome diſorder: then the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits being ſo diſtrubed, infect thoſe next to them, and they others, till by their continued ſeries, the paſſion begun within the Spleen, is propagated even to the brain, and there produces inordinate Phantaſms, ſuch as happen to hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacks, alſo on the other ſide, when a grievous diſtemper of the minde, occaſionally excited, within the brain, doth diſturb the Spirits inhabiting it, the impreſſion being carried to the Phantaſie, by the ſeries of the Spirits, planted within the nerves of the wandring pair, and the Intercoſtals, and ſucceſſive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, it is brought even to the Spleen; hence its ferment being put more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to commotion, ſtirs up Convulſions, both in that Inward, and in the whole neighbourhood of fibres and membranes; and beſides, forces the blood into eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings and flowings, and into various aeſtuations or vehement motions; yea and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects the perturbations of the Spirits, upon the brain. From this kinde of reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal affection of the brain and Spleen, it comes to paſs, that hypochondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks are ſo unquiet, unſtable, and fluctuating, at every thing thats propoſed, as if, according to the Poet, Ten mindes ſtrove in them at once.</p>

trembling of the heart, of an aſſiduous vertigo, too much waking, and a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed phanſie: About the 35th. year of his age, the diſeaſe growing worſe, he began hardly to ſleep, and yet more rarely to get it at night, and to be moleſted in the day time, with a world of fluctuating thoughts, to have in ſuſpition all things and perſons, and greatly to be afraid of every object: his <hi>Praecordia</hi> ſeemed to be very much bound, and ſtraitened, and to ſink down to the bottom, as if the heart it ſelf were depreſſed even into the belly; which Symptom, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling him, he became very ſad, and dejected in minde: yet afterwards, thoſe diſtempers of the minde remitting, he felt with it his heart to be a little lifted up and alſo his <hi>Praecordia</hi> to be looſened, and ſtretch'd forth; beſides, he very often ſuſtained pains and Contractions variouſly excited, about the muſcles of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and Members, and running up and down here and there.</p>
                     <p>As to the nature of the diſeaſe, it is plain, that it is this kinde of Diſtemper, which is commonly called hypochondriacall: but as to what reſpects the Cauſes of theſe to be admired Symptoms, we may ſuppoſe, the maſs of blood being degenerate, and ſtuffed with melanchollic or atrabilarie faeculencies, to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter or continually to ſuggeſt its aduſt recrements to the head; from whence, the Liquor watering the brain and nerves, being made ſharp, and improporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate to the Spirits, did ſtir up the containing Bodies, into painfull Corrugati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or wrinklings, and Contractures: Further, when this Infection is chiefly derived from the head, into the Nerves of the wandring pair, and the intercoſtall, the brain and the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> are very much puniſhed, by the malady from thence raiſed up. But that the Blood is depraved by that means, it ſeems to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the vice of the Spleen, foraſmuch as this Inward, being amiſs, it did not rightly ſtrain forth the atrabilarie dreggs from the blood, but rather did more pervert whatſoever recrements it received from it, and the ſame being exalted into an hurtfull ferment, ſent it back to the blood, and ſo very much infected its maſs, and imbued it with a plainly acetous, and vitriolick evill Diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>It is plain to be underſtood, that thoſe ſymptoms troubling the Head, <hi>viz.</hi> too much waking, the <hi>vertigo,</hi> a diſturbed phantaſie, with many others, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the heterogeneous particles poured forth from the Blood, into the brain: As to that ſtraitneſs of the Breaſt, and falling down of the heart, with great fear and ſadneſs, it may be thought, that the nervous <hi>fibres,</hi> inſerted to the heart, and chiefly to the <hi>Pericordium,</hi> being moved into Convulſions, and wrinklings, do binde hard thoſe parts, and pull them downwards; wherefore, there is perceived in the whole breaſt, as it were a certain conſtriction, and the heart it ſelf ſeems to be depreſſed: Further, foraſmuch the <hi>Praecordia</hi> being ſo ſtreitened and depreſſed, the blood within the boſom of the heart is ſtop'd, and compell'd, as it were to ſtagnate, both the vital and the ſenſitive Soul, is much hindred, from its wonted expanſion and irradiation, and for that Cauſe, being leſſened and ſhortened in its conſtitution, thoſe Cruell diſtempers of fear and ſadneſs ariſe, but when the Convulſions remitting, that conſtriction of the heart and its <hi>appendix,</hi> is releaſed, the Soul alſo, as a flame more expanſed or enlarged, endeavours by little and little to ſhake off the Chains of thoſe Paſſions. For the Cure of theſe Diſtempers, he had for a long time tried very many remedies, and medical Adminiſtrations, but without much benifit, at laſt he was ſomewhat ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the uſe of Spaw-waters, and from thence by degrees finding himſelf bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he became free from thoſe grievous Symptoms, however, he ſtill liv'd ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the <hi>hypochondriac</hi> Diſtemper.</p>

                     <p>That I may diſpatch the Pathologie of this Caſe in a word, it appears here plain enough, that the Spleen was firſt of all in fault; by whoſe fault, when the bloody maſs was depraved, the taint creeping from thence, into the humour wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the brain and nervous ſtock, and infecting it, did induce the aforeſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive Symptoms.</p>
                     <p>The Curatory Method to be uſed againſt the hypochondriacal Diſtempers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires chiefly theſe four generall Indications. <hi>viz.</hi> In the firſt place,<note place="margin">The Method of Curing the Hypochondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac Diſtempers.</note> that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments of the Cure may be taken away, the Intention of which chiefly reſpects the purging, and preſerving the firſt paſſages. Secondly, it muſt be endeavour'd that the obſtructions of the Spleen, may be Corrected. Thirdly, that both the recrements of the bloody maſs may be purged forth, and that its due diſpoſition may be reſtored. Fourthly, and laſtly, that the enormities of the brain and nervous ſtock, and alſo of the watering humour, and the inhabiting Spirits, contracted by the fault of the blood, and Spleen, may be amended, or taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: when any of theſe Intentions, or all of them together, ſhall be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured at, fit times ſhould be choſen, in which each being ſingly propoſed, may be performed, without any neglect or hindrance of the reſt.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. As to the firſt Indication, when a great load of crude or aduſt matter, is wont to be laid up in the firſt paſſages, and when the tone of the Ventricle us'd to be ſpoyled, and its ferment variouſly perverted, againſt every one of theſe kindes of evills, you muſt bring timely help, with fit remedies; therefore, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and moderate evacuations, both by Vomit if it proſpers well, and by Stool, ought to be adminiſtred: For ſuch, whoſe ſtomach eaſily caſts forth its contents upwards, I perſwade, that once in a month Vomiting ſhould be ſeveral times provoked by taking <hi>Liquor of Squills,</hi> or <hi>Salt of Vitriol,</hi> or by drinking plentifully ſmall beer poſſet-drink, or warm water; in the time between, a gentle purge, and only a little moving is to be orderd often: For this end, The pills <hi>Tartareous,</hi> of <hi>Bontius,</hi> or Stomach-pills with Gums, or our ſolutive extract, may be of uſe.

Among the number of theſe kinds of medicines, (which are commonly called Digeſtives) are <hi>Elixir Proprietatis, Tinctura Sacra, powder of Aron</hi> Compound, <hi>Salt of Wormwood, Cream of Tartar, Tartar vitriolat,, Vitriol of Steel,</hi> with many others. Beſides theſe inward Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, alſo external applications do often bring help: Becauſe the Stomach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill affected, a fomentation of <hi>white-wine,</hi> with <hi>wormwood, century,</hi> and other bitter plants boyled therein, alſo oyntments, or plaiſters, often bring help: Concerning which, there will be no need here to diſcourſe particularly; and to preſcribe forms of the Medicines themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond Indication, for the mending the vices of the Spleen, (to wit, if there ſhall be in the ſame any obſtruction, Tumour, or pain, or ſimple dyſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie or Intemperament,) is wont to be performed, or at leaſt attempted, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies both internal, and exrernal: Thoſe which are of the former Sort, fall in with thoſe indicated in the 3d place, (to wit, with ſuch, as for the purifying the Blood is intended) becauſe, when chiefly, or almoſt all, that which is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or born to the Spleen, is done by the paſſage of the blood, the irrigularities of the <hi>Latex</hi> of this, as well as of that Inward, by a Social labour, ought to be cured, with the joynt ſtrength of Medicines; by what means is ſhown by and by. In the mean time, ſome external Applications, under the form of a plaiſter, or an oyntment, or a fomentation, more neerly and immediatly reſpect the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:152521:263"/>
of the Spleen, and often bring notable help, foraſmuch as they diſcuſs tumors, and allay the Convulſive Diſtempers, and quiet them. Great plenty of theſe kinde of outward medicines, are every where extant among Authors, the choyce of which ought to be made, according to the various paſſions of the Spleen, or the divers Conſtitutions of the Patient, ſo that there will be no need here, to ſhew their particular forms.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Remedies indicated in the 3d place, to wit, which take away the dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſies or evill temper of the blood, contracted from the vice of the Spleen, and alſo clear the primary fault of the Spleen, are of a manifold, and divers kinde, and manner, the choice of which ought to be adminiſtred, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious infection of this, or that: of theſe, ſome are compounded, and prepared according to the preſcription of Phyſitians, as <hi>Electuaries, Powders, Apozems, Tinstures, Infuſions,</hi> and the like; others more ſimple, as <hi>whey, aſſes milk, Spaw-waters,</hi> and <hi>Bathes.</hi>

The fourth Indication, reſpecting the affections of the brain, and nervous ſtock, or the Convulſive Symptoms having relation to or coming upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, is rarely in uſe of it ſelf, and apart from the others, but that Remedies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated to this end, are complicated with thoſe aboveſaid. Liquors indued with a volatile Salt, or an armoniac, as <hi>Spirits of Harts-horn,</hi> and <hi>Sut,</hi> are highly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for this Intention, as alſo the reſt but now recitied; wherefore ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, unleſs any thing ſhall ſhew the contrary, may be dayly given at fit hours. Further, when Spaw-waters are drunk, let tablets or pills, ſuch as are above-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, for the Convulſive diſtempers, be taken at leaſt twice in a day. In the frequent turning, and giddineſs, alſo in the paſſions of the heart, the ſinking down of the Spirits, with dread, and as it were a fear of Death, juſt ſeizing on one, I have known very often, great help to be had, by the uſe of Chalibeat, or ſteel Medicines.</p>
                     <p>Since we have made mention ſo often, of Chalibiat or ſteel-medicins,<note place="margin">The preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and effects of Steel Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> it will be worth our while, to inquire into their various preparations, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon their divers manners of effects, which they are wont to produce in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body, that it may from hence appear, by what means, and for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, theſe or thoſe preparations of Iron, are greatly profitable to ſome hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacks, and to others as much hurtfull.</p>
                     <p>The virtue and operation of Chalybeat, or ſteel'd mecicines, depends upon the porticles of the concerts, being after a various manner diſſolved, unfolded, and brought forth into act: For ſteel, or Iron, conſiſts chiefly of a <hi>Salt Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Earth:</hi> and but ſlenderly indued with Spirits and water: But the particles of the former Elements, chiefly the Sulphureous, and ſaline, being in their mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture combined together, with the Earth, remain altogether fixed, and ſluggiſh, but being ſoluted, and pulled one from another, they come to be of a very effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Energy.</p>
                     <p>The aforeſaid particles are diſſolved in a twofold manner, and ſet into the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of acting: <hi>viz.</hi> either by Art, whilſt medicins are prepared, or by Nature after they are taken inwardly; for the metallic Body, is wont to be diſſolved, and eaten, by the ferment of the ventricle, juſt like a Chymical <hi>menſtrum:</hi> we will conſider the ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> of either, and their manner of being made, that it may appear, what alteration is impreſſed, on the ſteeled medicine, in the preparation; and what effects every preparation of it, doth impreſſe on mans Body.</p>
                     <p>The moſt ſimple way of preparing Iron, is a diviſion of its body, into little integral parts, with a file, which reſemble the nature of the whole mixture, and contain both little ſulpureous bodies, and ſaline, combined among themſelves, and with other terreſtrial. The filings of Iron being inwardly taken, is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the ferment of the ventricle, as it were by an acid <hi>menſtrum;</hi> the ſignes of which are, both a ſulphureous and unſavorie belching, as from the eating of hard eggs, alſo the blackneſs of the ordure, from ſteel being diſſolved within the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of Concoction, active particles, both Sulphureous and Saline, Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully ſally forth, and being involved with the nutritious juice, are carried into the blood; which as they excell in a divers virtue, do often conſpire, as it were with the joynt forces of either, to bring benefit to the ſick. The Sulphureous little bodies being brought to the blood, add to it a new, and more plentifull Proviſion of Sulphur, wherefore its maſs, if before it was poor and liveleſs, doth nimbly ferment within its veſſells, and being inkindled farther in the heart, acquires a more intenſe heat, yea, and a deeper colour; for it is ſo obſerved, in many affected with the dropſy, ariſing from white phlegm, the Pica or evill
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:152521:264"/>
longings, or green-ſickneſs, to have a pale countenance, cold bloud, and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; but by the uſe of ſteel, the countenance ſoon to be more florid, and the blood to be imbued with a more intenſe tincture, and heat: moreover, from the filing of iron, diſſolved in the ventricle, alſo Saline particles are brought forth, and often they beſtow a more plentifull fruit or increaſe, both on the ſolid parts, and on the humors; for ſince their natures are vitriolick, and ſtiptic or binding, they bind together, and ſtrengthen the too lax, and weakned <hi>fibres</hi> of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and ſo reſtore the broken tone: Beſides theſe Saline particles, inhibit the force of the blood; repreſs it from too much heat, and boyling up, and froth, and retain it in an equall circulation: Beſides (which is their chief virtue) they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and ſtraiten the too looſe, open, and gaping little mouths of the Arteries; that, for that reaſon, neither the <hi>Serum,</hi> nor the bloody <hi>latex,</hi> may ſweat out, or be broke off, from the file of its circuit: Wherefore in the Dropſie, and great bleedings, Remedies, imbued with the Saline particles of Iron, are of famous and efficacious uſe, for very many Diſeaſes proceed from this cauſe, foraſmuch as the little mouths of the Arteries, being too open, and the interſpaces of the veſſells above meaſure looſned, the <hi>ſerum</hi> or bloody <hi>latex</hi> breaks forth; which kinde of Affections, the Vitriollic Particles of Steel, do often help, by binding and corroborating, the ſanguiferous Veſſells, and nervous <hi>fibres.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this manner, the <hi>filings of Steel,</hi> being taken inwardly, ſeems at once to add to the blood, both ſpurs, and a bridle. But foraſmuch, as from this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, an incitation, much more than a reſtriction, doth ariſe, therefore it ought to be given only to them, whoſe blood is very thick, and cold, as country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſtrong perſons; in very hot, and ſpirituous bloud, and in hot inwards, 'tis no ways convenient: moreover, in delicate perſons, and men of a more tender conſtitution, 'tis dangerous, leſt the little portions of the ſteel, when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſufficiently diſſolved, ſhould like fragments of glaſs, be driven into the membranes of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and there pertinaciouſly ſticking, produce ſome ulcer, or deadly torments, which indeed I have known ſometimes to happen.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. After the filing of Iron, the next way of preparing it, is calcining it with Sulphur, to wit, let thin peeces of ſteel, being ſtrongly fired, be laid upon a roler of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> that the mettle may melt into little round balls, which are to be calcined to the conſumption of the Sulphur, and pounded in a morter, are to be reduced into a ſubtle powder, which is of choice uſe. In this preparation of Iron, ſome ſulphureous particles are exhaled, the ſigne of which is, that this powder, an acid liquor being poured upon it, much leſs boyls up, or grows hot than the limature or filing of Iron: but being taken by the ſame mouth, it excites a Sulphureous ſavour. In the mean time, in this preparation, the ſaline parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſeem to be ſomewhat augmented, by new ones ſticking to them, from the mettall burning with Sulphur, ſo that active particles of either kinde, to wit, Sulphureous and Saline, come almoſt to an <hi>Aequilibrium:</hi> and when by this means, this medicine, the ſubſtance of the mettle being looſned, may be finely poudered, it becomes of far more excellent uſe, than the filings ef Iron: In moſt Caſes, where ſteel ought to be given in ſubſtance, as in a Cachexie or a fullneſs of evill humours, the longings of maids or the green-gckneſs, and ſuch like, this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is convenient to be uſed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the third place, follows the preparation of ſteel with vinegar: to wit, the filings of the whole ſteel, is moyſten'd with vinegar, and dryed, till it may be reduced into an impalpable powder: in this preparation, the Sulphureous particles are yet much more, yea, as to the greateſt part evaporated, only a few being left, in the mean time, the Saline, by reaſon of others ſticking to them, from the vinegar, are much encreaſed, which are mingled with the terrene particles: This chalibiated powder, very little or nothing froths, or boyles up, a ſharp liquor being ſprinkled upon it, alſo being taken at the mouth, has with it ſcarce any ſulphureous Savour: wherefore, it conduces leſs, to the taking away of the obſtructions of the Bowells, or to the reſtoring the ferment of the blood: nevertheleſs, in a more hot Conſtitution, in hemorrhages or fluxes of Blood, and the hypochondriac Diſtemper, it is wont to be adminiſtred with greater ſucceſs, then the former preparations.</p>
                     <p n="4">4ly. Follows the ruſt of Iron, which being an extract of the metallic body, ſeems to be as it were a fifth Eſſence: becauſe, in this excreſcency, ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:152521:264"/>
of every kinde, to wit, ſulphureous, ſaline, and terrene, being looſned from the whole ſubſtance, are combined among themſelves; and conſtitute as it were a new mixture, more ſubtile, and defaecated or clearer from dreggs: For that in this concrete, there remains leſs particles of ſulphur, therefore it doth not ſo potently ferment the blood, or take away the obſtructions of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> as ſteel prepared with ſulphur; but in more hot diſtempers of the parts, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, it egregiouſly performs the requiſite Intentions, of a ſteeled Medicine.</p>
                     <p>To this Claſs may be referred by right, our preparation of ſteel, to wit, in which all the particles of the mettal, being looſned from the bond of mixture, are contained together: which notwithſtanding, (the concrete being firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into pouder) and immediatly diſſolved, in any water or Menſtruum. This powder being inwardly taken hath the like vertue as ſteel prepared with ſulphur; but to the liquor or menſtruum, in which it is diſſolved, it imparts almoſt only ſaline, or chiefly vitriolic particles, the ſulphureous flying away, and the terene ſinking to the bottom. I am wont to give in great quantity, and not ſeldom with excellent ſucceſs, common water impregnated with the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, inſtead of the natural acidulous or ſpawiſh waters: moreover, I make thereof medicated wine, beer, cyder, whey, or other Liquors, this pouder being diſſolved in them; and preſcribe them to be taken, for ſeveral intricate Intentions: So much for the preparations of Iron, in which the elementary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of every kinde, are comprehended in a various proportion: There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main others, in which the particles almoſt only of one kinde, to wit, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, or earthie, are left, the reſt, as to the greateſt part, being driven forth: of which ſort, are chiefly vitriol, or the Salt of ſteel.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. For the making the vitriol of ſteel, firſt, the mettal is wont to be eaten thorow, with a very ſharp and corroſive Liquor, and to be diſſolved into ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary parts: In the diſſolving, the ſaline particles of the menſtruum, are joyned to the other ſalines of the Iron, and are with them intimately combined; in the mean time, the remaining ſulphureous, and terrene, being laid aſide, and excluded from their company; then common water being poured to this ſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ſalts of either kinde being combined, are imbibed by the Liquor, and that being laſtly filtrated, and evaporated, they are reduced into chriſtalls. This kinde of making of ſalt or ſalification, ſuccedes, if you do it, either with the Spirit of vitriol, the oyle of ſulphur, or ſtygian water, or any others, diſtilled from the ſtagmas of mineralls: Yea, <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> only, being ſoluted by melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, diſſolves Iron after the ſame manner, and cauſes it to Chryſtalize.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Salt of Steel</hi> thus prepared, hath a ſweetiſh taſte, with a certain ſharp ſtipticity of binding, and participates much of the nature of <hi>vitriol,</hi> that it ſeems not to differ much from Verdigreaſe. Taken inwardly for a medicine, it ſomewhat ferments the humors, and powerfully bindes the nervous <hi>fibres:</hi> for cold Cache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cical, and Phlegmatic people, this medicine is not convenient, becauſe there are in it no particles of <hi>Sulphur:</hi> but it is often adminiſtred with ſucceſſe, in hot diſtempers of the bowels, where there is a predominancy of aduſt <hi>Sulphur</hi> and in wandring efferveſcencies, in ſcorbutical, and unequall heats, both of the blood and nervous ſtock, by it ſelf, or mixed with other medicines, as an enforcement: but yet in more tender Conſtitutions, 'tis dangerous, leſt the tone and <hi>fibres</hi> of the ventricle ſhould be hurt, by its acrimony, and too great conſtriction or aſtringency.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In the laſt place, follows the aſtringent <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> or the <hi>Crocus of Steel,</hi> prepared by fire, through a long Calcination, <hi>viz.</hi> The filings, the off-ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or thin plates of Iron, ſhould be ſo placed in a reverberating fornace, that they may be continually heated, by a moſt ſtrong flame: The filing being thus expoſed to the naked fire; firſt of all it grows reddiſh, and runs together into little hard round balls; but after 3. or 4. days, ſwelling up ſuddenly into an higher heap, it becomes extream light, impalpable, and of a moſt curious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Colour: In this preparation, the Sulphureous and ſaline particles, whilſt by the force of the fire, they begin to come away from the concreet, do mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally take hold one of another, and ſo being combined together, grow into little balls; but afterwards, thoſe particles, both Saline and Sulphureous, being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profligated, and fiery particles ſucceeding in their place, the whole maſs ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up into a bulk, and made as it were ſpungie, becomes moſt light.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="102" facs="tcp:152521:265"/>A Medicine thus prepared, in ſome Caſes, is of moſt excellent uſe, and ſecond to none of the Chalybeats: to wit, almoſt in all extravaſations, or too great eruptions of the <hi>Serum</hi> and blood, as in outward <hi>haemorrhages,</hi> or in inward bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in the <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> the <hi>Diabatis,</hi> and in a vehement Catarrh; alſo I have known no remedy better than this, in the <hi>Aſcitis,</hi> or in the beginning of a Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: and this alſo, I have heard to be highly approved of lately by a moſt famous and expert Phyſitian, of our own Country: Concerning which medicine notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſince it is wholly deſtitute, both of Saline and ſulphureous Particles, and conſiſts almoſt only of earthly and fiery particles, it is very ambiguous, by what faculty it operates, and produces ſo praiſe-worthy an effect in man's body: for there ſeems to be in this, left no more <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> or dead head, or <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra damnata,</hi> then in vitriol, or in any of the other mettalls, diſtilled be a moſt intenſe fire. As to this if I may Conjecture, it ſeems firſt, that to this prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſome Activity is due, whereby it exerts it ſelf, and unfolds its virtues, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſhutting up obſtructions, or by binding together the Veſſells, or ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous <hi>fibres</hi> of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> from the fiery particles, ſhut up in the moſt fixed earth, and from them breaking forth within the body: But the chiefeſt reaſon of help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiſts in this, that the earthy particles, the Saline (by which they were ſtrickly held) being wholly gone, deſire greedily to be reunited to them, or ſuch like: Wherefore, this <hi>Crocus martis,</hi> being immerſed in our Bodies, ſnatches to it ſelf, whatſoever Salts it meets with, and intimately binds them, and ſo, while it ſucks up like a ſponge, very many ſaline particles, it takes away many enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, ariſing chiefly from the flux of the Salts. By this means, <hi>Burnt harts-horn, Spodium,</hi> and <hi>Antimony Diaphoretic,</hi> when they bring help exert or put forth their virtues.</p>

In the mean time, by reaſon of the breathing being hindred, and the blood being reſtrained within the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and for that cauſe ſtagnating in other places, the ſick were in danger of being choaked, and often acquired a livid, or dead countenance. But in this Caſe, beſides the Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons raiſed up about the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> by the force of Coughing, the Ventricle alſo, being often brought Into a conſent, caſt forth by vomit, whatever it contained in its boſom: yea, and I know in ſome tender ones, after this manner affected, the Diſeaſe wandring from thence into other parts, did raiſe up Convulſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Face, eyes, and limbs, and at length became deadly. This kinde of Convulſive Cough is very frequent among children, and ſome years lays hold
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:152521:265"/>
on ſo many, that it ſeems to be plainly Epidemical; when it roots it ſelf, it is very difficult to be cured, by Remedies, yea often being long protracted, it is hardly otherwiſe to be cured, but by the ſtate of the year being changed.</p>
                     <p>If the cauſes of the aforeſaid Caſe be inquired into, it will be ſo plain,<note place="margin">The reaſon of it.</note> to refer the procatartic or more remote cauſe, to the redundancy of the Serous humour in the bloody maſs, and in ſome ſort in the whole body; a portion of which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, dropping forth from the little mouths of the Arteries, on the Lungs, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates the ordinary Cough; afterwards, when the ſerous Colluvies or heap of waters yet exuberateing in the Blood, and ſtuffed with Convulſive particles, is alſo heaped up within the head, the ſame entring the pneumonic nerves, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes the ſimple, into a Convulſive Cough: For when thoſe nerves, being irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated firſt about their extremities, are exerciſed above meaſure, for that reaſon they more eaſily imbibe the Convulſive matter, laid up nigh their beginnings: and ſo, when at length, they are driven into irregular motions, in two places, to wit, in the head, and at the tale, and that for two diſtinct cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> from the irritation of the Spirits, and from their exploſion; it is no wonder, if the Cough, at firſt Common, being afterwards brought into this evill ſtate, becomes ſo cruel and Convulſive: Moreover, when it ſometimes happens, that the ſame matter, heaped up in the head, does enter ſome other nerve, therefore Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive paſſions of another manner, often come upon the Convulſive Cough.</p>
                     <p>Having ſhown after this manner, that a cough doth ariſe, not only,<note place="margin">The Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Aſthma.</note> nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways by the fault of the Lungs, but ſometimes from a ſolitary Convulſive cauſe, but oftener ſuperinduced by this, on a pneumatic Diſtemper: alſo we do not doubt to determine almoſt the ſame thing, concerning another certain Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Aſthma:</hi> For whether this Diſeaſe be continuall, or periodical, in either Caſe, the Symptom chiefly urging, is difficult Breathing;<note place="margin">Sometimes it, depends of the Lungs, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the nerves being affected.</note> which indeed ſeems to be excited for this reaſon, becauſe the Lungs being too much inflated, and diſtended, extremely fills the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> neither do they fall down as they ſhould do, by turns: hence the Spirit or breath remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within, is not ſent forth freely enough, neither indeed can freſh aire be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly induced, by reaſon the ſpace is before filled: whileſt the Lungs are ſo longer contained in a continual, or very little remiſs Diaſtole, oftentimes the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma,</hi> is urged contrary to its manner, into a violent Syſtole, and being drawn upwards, is wont more and more to lift up the Lungs, and to hinder their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down; whereby it comes to paſs, that reſpiration becoms yet more difficult, and more laborious.</p>
                     <p>We eaſily believe, that this kinde of hard breathing Diſtemper, doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen by the fault of the Lungs, becauſe anatomical Inſpection hath plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly detected it: For if a great Serous Colluvies, being layd up in the <hi>Thorax,</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much ſtuffs the Lungs, and ſo much obſtructs all their pores and paſſages, that the blood being hindred in its Circute, cannot freely paſs thorow the Pneumonic Veſſells, for that reaſon indeed, ſuch like anhelous Diſtempers are ſometimes made: Then, as often as the blood growing more hot and rarified, by exerciſe or the heat of the Bed, requires a larger ſpace for its Circulation, within the Lungs; then preſently from ſuch an occaſion, a more frequent Reſpiration, or an aſthmatical fit is ſtirred up: If beſide this morbid Diſpoſition of the Breaſt, the Sanguineous maſs, alſo abounding with a ſerous water, ſhould be apt to ſudden fluxions and efferveſcencies of the Serum, from hence alſo, by reaſon of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent courſe of the Serum growing hot, into the Lungs, being before obſtructed, and greatly filled, very often moſt grievous aſſaults of this Diſeaſe, and almoſt ſuffocating do happen. Moreover, ſometimes, beſide, the roots of the aſthma (as it is ſaid) being fixed about the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> certain ſhoots of the ſame diſeaſe, budding forth from the head, meet with the former, and being complicated with them, produce the more cruel fruits of the <hi>Dyſpnaea,</hi> or want of Breath. For, becauſe the Lungs being ſtuffed with <hi>Serum,</hi> another quantity of the ſame, more largely redounding in the blood, being imbued with Convulſive particles, is poured on the head, the ſame more readily entring the pneumonic nerves, than others, cauſes the <hi>Aſthma</hi> of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> at firſt Simple and modetate, to become periodically vehement, and Convulſive.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe kinde of Diſtempers, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Dyſpnaea,</hi> being excited by the ſingular fault of the Lungs, and with a Companion, very many inſtances, and examples

For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more uſual, then for thoſe that are ſick of an inveterate cough, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evill diſpoſition of the Lungs, at length the Dropſie, or Scurvie hapning to become Aſthmatick, to wit, when the Blood being made much more impure, lays up alſo its ſerous dreggs in the head, theſe more readily, and indeed more eaſily enter then others, the pneumonic nerves, as being weaker, and often ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritated neer their extremities, and in them do heap up matter, for a Convulſive <hi>Dyſpnaea.</hi>

                     <p>A certain ſtrong and fat Gentleman, having uſed for ſome time a more full and inordinate Diet, without any exerciſe, began to be ill about the beginning of the winter: at firſt he was troubled with a pain and heavineſs of his head, with a grear giddineſs, and fear of ſwoonding, and believing himſelf juſt about to dye, being otherways healthfull; within a few days, theſe Symptoms paſs'd into an apparent <hi>Stupor,</hi> or rather Lethargie: he being let blood in his Arm, I cauſed carefully to be applied Cupping-glaſſes, Veſicatories, and ſharp Clyſters, with many other Remedies: In the ſpace of 42. hours coming to himſelf, he was ſenſible, and ſhook off all torpor or drouſineſs. But although his brain was clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet he was taken with a great weakneſs, and numbneſs in his members which Diſtempers however were ſhortly cured, with antiparyletic and antiſcorbutic Remedies: But after a fortnight, he began again to complain of an heavineſs and giddineſs in his head, then the next day after, he fell into a horrid <hi>Aſthma:</hi> that the Lungs being ſuddenly inflated, and endeavouring to come upwards, the Breath, which was very quick and laborious, was hindred, and not being able to come forth, he was in danger every minute of an hour to be choaked. This fit as it was cruel, ſo it paſs'd over within 12. hours, without any ſpitting, cough, or vomit, and then, within a weeks ſpace, he loſt all the trouble of his breaſt; but then the like fit of the <hi>Dyſpnaea</hi> or difficult breathing returning, exercis'd him ſomewhat more gently; and afterwards, he was wont to be troubled with ſuch a fit of the <hi>Aſthma,</hi> nigh to the great mutations of the Air, chiefly in great cold, or the falling of Snow.</p>

This kinde of fit by degrees remitting, within 7 or 8. hours, at length gave over; but then after a week or two, it was wont to come again, either of it ſelf, or from any the leaſt occaſion; after that the force of the Diſeaſe, its matter being beſtow'd on very many of theſe kinde of fits, paſs'd away, this excellent virgin was well enough for many weeks, yea ſometimes months after, and breath'd freely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fault of the <hi>Thorax.</hi> For this perſon, I inſtituted this following method, Spring and fall, and now it is more than two years, ſince ſhe has had any fit of this Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>Take of our <hi>Sulphur of Antimony,</hi> gr. vi. of <hi>Cream of tartar,</hi> vi, grains, mix them: Let it be given in the pap of a roſted apple, with this medicine ſhe was wont to vomit 4. or 5. times: four days after, ſhe took this cathartic, which was wont to be repeated, twice, after 6. or 7. days between: Take <hi>Calomelun</hi> xii. grains, of the <hi>Reſin of Jolop,</hi> v. grains, of <hi>caſtor</hi> gr. iiii. with what will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Ammoniac</hi> diſſolved, make iii. pills: every day beſides, ſhe took morning and evening, of the tincture of <hi>Antimony,</hi> grains xii. in a Spoonfull of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Julap, drinking after it 6. or 7.

                     <p>In theſe Caſes alſo, nothing ſeems to appear more clearly, than that the cauſe of the Diſeaſe, without any phlegm or viſcous humour, being impacted in the Lungs, as is commonly beleeved, doth ſubſiſt within the nervous ſtock; and that this kind of <hi>Dyſpnaea</hi> or difficult breathing, meerly convulſive, is excited, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Pneumonic nervs, being poſſeſſed by the Convulſive Diſtemper. The verity of this may be yet more clearly evinced, by an anatomical obſervation,<note place="margin">An Anati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Obſervation</note> lately Comunicated to me, by the learned Phyſitian Doctor <hi>Walter Needham.</hi> That moſt famous man told me, that he knew a Butcher of <hi>Wallſallen</hi> in the County of <hi>Stafford,</hi> who when he had been long ſick of a periodical <hi>Aſthma,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning within 14. or 20 days at fartheſt, at length he dyed in a fit.

But (added he) the cauſes unknown to us, certainly not Conſpicuous to our eyes, were to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the nervous ſtock being affected.</p>
                     <p>Sometime paſt I was conſulted with, about a noble child,<note place="margin">Anoiher Anatomical Obſervation.</note> who being about 12. months old, was grieviouſly afflicted with Convulſion fits, and as it were E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pileptic, of which he quickly dyed. I often obſerved, that whileſt the Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the outward parts intermitted, he was taken with a cruel ſobbing, or hooping Cough: from whence I ſuſpected, that the morbific matter, was no leſs fixed in the breaſt, than in the brain. But after its Death, the body being open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Lungs well furniſh'd, appeared clear from any fault, that it clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:152521:267"/>
that this cough meerly Convulſive, was excited by reaſon of the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per of the nervous ſtock.</p>
                     <p>As to what reſpects the Remedies, and curatory means, which ought to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the aforeſaid caſes, when that convulſive Symptoms come upon the Cough, or difficulty of breathing, firſt excited from the default of the Lungs, and ſo by reaſon of the taint, communicated to the brain; it muſt be carefully heeded, that Convulſive medicines be aptly compounded, with thoſe reſpecting all the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Thorax.</hi> Yea that ſometimes theſe, ſometimes thoſe, being given by themſelves, may between whiles fill up the times of curing, it will not be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in this place, to bring the bechic, or Pneumonic medicines, and forms of them, ſince an immenſe company of them, are extant every where, among Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Authors.
